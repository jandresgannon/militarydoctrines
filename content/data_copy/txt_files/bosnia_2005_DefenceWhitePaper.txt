### MESSAGE BY THE PRESIDENCY OF BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA 

With our common efforts to enable Bosnia and Herzegovina to achieve overall progress
and stability, furthermore to confirm its belongingness in Euro-Atlantic family of liberal and
democratic states, the implementation process of radical and overall reforms and transformations
in more areas of our society is ongoing.

Among all those reforms, we have now especially placed emphasis on the reform of the
defence sector, acknowledging that the defence reforms, as a part of the overall reforms in our
country, by size, content and objective significance, are the strong mechanism for strengthening
of internal stability, and also support the credibility in efforts for joining of Bosnia and
Herzegovina into European and Euro-Atlantic integration structures.

The defence reforms, initiated with establishment of the Defence Reform Commission,
supported by the essential legislative and structural adjustments and changes out of which the
adoption of the BiH Law on Defence (BiH Official Gazette, number: 43/2003) has a special
significance, furthermore, the implementation of number of recommendations and conclusions
of the Commission have enabled huge progress in establishment of the system of Command and
Control over the Armed Forces, complete parliamentary oversight at BiH level and full
transparency of the defence plans and budget.

The progress that has been achieved in restructuring and reforms of the defence
structures, with objective to accomplish the strategic integration goals, we consider exceptionally
significant. The common defence, economic and every other safety has now been accepted as the
key concept for future action and it becomes the main driving force for continuation of the
reforms. Although it is still far from finalization, the reform of the defence sector in BiH is in its
full swing, directed towards two mutually connected strategic goals – joining the European
Union (EU) and NATO.

Therefore, The Defence White Paper represents the report to the citizens and people of
BiH “on the status of their Armed Forces”. As it was clearly stated in this document, our goals
and intentions in Bosnia and Herzegovina are to apply the best practices and experiences
established in advanced democracies, furthermore to develop the professional military forces that
are organized, manned and trained in accordance with NATO standards and which will with its
size and capabilities be able to fulfill the legitimate defence requirements and be compatible with
the economic possibilities of its country.

We hope that the The Defence White Paper will clearly indicate the achievements up to
date, as well as our vision on how to maintain this momentum in the future - which promises
peace and prosperity to all of us and the generations to come.

March 2005

Mr. Borislav Paravac, Chairman of the BiH Presidency

Mr. Ivo Miro Jović, Member of the BiH Presidency

Mr. Sulejman Tihić, Member of the BiH Presidency

### I

 DEFENCE REFORM: TOWARDS COLLECTIVE SECURITY

In July 2001, the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina formally expressed Bosnia and
Herzegovina’s readiness to accept its obligations and rights in the family of Euro-Atlantic
nations, and to contribute actively to collective security. The Presidency also expressed Bosnia
and Herzegovina’s commitment to integration into Euro-Atlantic structures, to the Partnership
for Peace programme, and to the implementation of defence reforms including restructuring of
the Armed Forces. Over the past three years, working in the context of these objectives, we have
striven to create a suitable environment for defence reform, to achieve internal stability, and to
become a credible candidate for the Partnership for Peace programme.

The defence reform process began in 2003 with the establishment of the Defence Reform
Commission, proceeding through the work of the Commission and culminating with the
publication of the Commission’s report. The aim was to establish a common defence system,
taking into account the security environment and economic realities. Over the last twelve
months, as a result of this process, significant changes have been made to the structure and the
functioning of the Bosnia and Herzegovina defence system.

Before the start of the defence reform process in 2003, the defence system of Bosnia and
Herzegovina faced very complex problems, and reforms were therefore directed towards their
resolution. The requirements for defence reform were derived from an analysis of the following
factors:

     - Inadequate State-level command and control of the Armed Forces;

     - Ambiguities and inconsistencies regarding State and entity authorities in defence
matters;

     - Insufficient parliamentary oversight and control of the Armed Forces;

     - Lack of transparency in defence matters at all levels;

     - Non-compliance with international commitments, particularly politico-military
aspects of relevant OSCE documents;

     - The size, structure and equipment of the Armed Forces, which were not
commensurate with real defence and security requirements;

     - Disproportionate funding for defence activities;

     - Deteriorating arms and ammunition stored at an excessive number of inappropriate
locations; and

     - Poor conditions of service for the full-time and conscript components of the Armed
Forces.

                                 - 6 

-----

As a consequence of these factors, the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina were faced
with reduced operational effectiveness and decreasing morale. This situation represented an
obstacle to the realisation of the expressed commitment of Bosnia and Herzegovina to EuroAtlantic integration.

Bosnia and Herzegovina’s readiness and determination to implement defence reforms is
prompted by the necessity to achieve a higher level of effectiveness in defence and to create the
conditions necessary to achieve Euro-Atlantic integration.

### The Results of Defence Reform to Date 

The primary objective of the defence reform process was the establishment and strengthening of
State-level institutions which could function as the supreme authority in defence-related issues.
Consequently, activities have focused on increasing the authority of the Presidency of Bosnia
and Herzegovina as the supreme commander of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina,
expanding the role the Parliamentary Assembly of Bosnia and Herzegovina in order to exercise
effective democratic control over the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and establishing
State-level defence institutions capable of supporting the Presidency in exercising command and
control over the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Amendments to the entity constitutions and the adoption of new laws during 2003 and 2004
made possible the creation of a common defence establishment in Bosnia and Herzegovina, with
an appropriate division of responsibilities between the State and the entities, mechanisms that
will provide for efficient command and control of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina,
and improvements in military interoperability, democratic oversight and transparency.

The establishment of the Bosnia and Herzegovina Ministry of Defence, Joint Staff and
Operational Command is the most evident result of defence reform, as these institutions shall
contribute directly to the operational capability and functioning of the Armed Forces of Bosnia
and Herzegovina and enable Bosnia and Herzegovina’s participation in programmes such as the
Partnership for Peace.

Command and control over the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina is exercised by the
Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina through the Bosnia and Herzegovina Ministry of
Defence, Joint Staff and Operational Command. Command and control is exercised through an
Operational and Administrative chain of command.

The purpose of the Bosnia and Herzegovina defence system is, through the organisation, training
and equipping of the Armed Forces, to carry out the missions set forth in the Bosnia and
Herzegovina Constitution, Law on Defence and Defence Policy.

This means that Bosnia and Herzegovina must be able to mobilise and employ the Armed Forces
in order to protect its sovereignty, participate in internationally-mandated peace operations, and
support civilian authorities in the event of natural and man-made disasters.

The key principles in the reform process are: democratic civilian control over the Armed Forces

                              - 10 

-----

of Bosnia and Herzegovina; transparency in defence planning; and approval and implementation
of a common defence budget, taking into account the need for democratic authorities to establish
fiscal limitations for defence. One of the significant accomplishments in the implementation of
defence reform has been the establishment of the Joint Defence and Security Policy Committee
of the Bosnia and Herzegovina Parliamentary Assembly, which conducts parliamentary
oversight and control over the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

With respect to the Armed Forces, their size has been significantly reduced and restructuring is
in progress. Reductions in the size and structure of the Armed Forces shall provide for
rationalisation of defence budget and for greater effectiveness and efficiency.

**YEAR**

In March 2004, the Presidency issued a decision approving a plan for General Officer posts
within the new structure, which determined a maximum thirteen general officer posts in the
Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The highest ranking officer in the Armed Forces of
Bosnia and Herzegovina is the Chief of Joint Staff, a Lieutenant-General. In addition, the
Presidency directed that General Officers then serving in the Army of the Federation of Bosnia
and Herzegovina and the Army of Republika Srpska would not be appointed to General Officer
posts in State-level defence institutions and structures.

This decision clearly confirmed the orientation of Bosnia and Herzegovina towards new
challenges, making way for new ideas and for the implementation of reforms. Much of the
necessary reform has already been implemented, but many planned and anticipated goals remain
to be achieved. Near-term tasks include the establishment of a Common Defence Resource
Management System, a Common Personnel Management System, a Common Equipment Plan,
and related training requirements. These are obviously significant tasks; however, there is firm
determination to adequately respond to these challenges.

### II

 THE SECURITY ENVIRONMENT OF BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA

General security, peace and stability are preconditions for the well-being and functioning
of every society. Basic considerations, assessments and analyses of security risks and challenges
are included in strategic documents such as the security and defence policies of Bosnia and
Herzegovina. Significant progress and visible improvement in the security environment in the
Balkans has been achieved in past years. Governments in the region have been democratically
elected; some countries are already member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation
(NATO) or Partnership for Peace, while all others are committed to becoming part of the NATO
family as soon as possible.

All countries in the region have identified accession to the European Union as a primary foreign
policy goal. In this environment there is virtually no risk of external aggression against Bosnia
and Herzegovina in the near future. Therefore, at this moment there is no real threat that might
endanger the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina. If there are radical
changes that threaten the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the
new challenges would be met by appropriate measures and activities directed to defence
preparation, based on the principles of collective defence and full co-operation with friendly and
allied countries.

                              - 12 

-----

### Security Challenges 

**Global Challenges. The security challenges faced by Bosnia and Herzegovina must be**
considered in the global context. These challenges are largely the consequence of:
growing differences in economic and social development; differences between the rich
and the poor parts of the world; international terrorism in all of its forms; constant threats
to the environment as a result of industrial and technological development; the
uncontrolled production and sale of weapons, including weapons of mass destruction
(nuclear and biological weapons); and intensified forced migration as a consequence of
armed conflict, racial conflicts and discrimination, ethnic intolerance, or political
pressure in autocratic and undemocratic regimes. There are also challenges related to the
various forms of organised crime that underpin constant social and political instability in
certain states, to overall poverty, and to the spread of various incurable diseases that
endanger entire populations.

**Regional Challenges. Specific challenges for the region of South East Europe as a**
whole are: instability resulting from the transition to market economies, exacerbated by
the stagnation of the region in comparison to more developed countries; and the geostrategic position of the region, located on important routes between Europe and Asia
(which are routes for the transport of oil and natural gas, but also for illegal traffic in
weapons, narcotics, white slavery etc., and which could also be used for movement of
various terrorist groups and to facilitate terrorist activities). During the last decade of the
twentieth century, this region was the scene of various conflicts that left economic,
psychological, social and other consequences. There are still attempts for secession,
autonomy and independence by certain ethnic groups which, in conjunction with the
relatively high concentration of military capacities, makes the overall situation more
complex.

**Internal Challenges. Bosnia and Herzegovina is a complex country, burdened with**
internal problems resulting from different political factors such as:

         - The remnants of political and social animosities as a result of the 1992-1995
conflict, supported by elements propagating various forms of nationalistic
extremism;

         - Slow implementation of the Dayton Peace Accords;

         - Problems of political transition that have resulted in the slow development of
effective and efficient executive, legislative and judicial authorities;

         - Problems of transition to a market economy that have resulted in a low level
of domestic and foreign investment, the existence of the grey economy and
black market, slow implementation of privatisation processes, technologically
obsolete production facilities and uneven reconstruction of damaged
infrastructure;

                              - 13 

-----

         - Porous borders that allow trafficking in narcotics and weapons and human
trafficking, and that enable the concealment and transit of persons accused for
war crimes, international criminals and terrorists;

         - Problems of unemployment that have caused a brain drain of highly educated
and young people and contributed to increased general poverty, social
differences and instability, particularly among pensioners and other groups
requiring greater social assistance;

         - Excessive amounts of armaments and ammunition stored in inadequate
facilities;

         - Large numbers of anti-personnel mines and unexploded ordnance throughout
the country, posing a physical danger for the citizens of Bosnia and
Herzegovina and an obstacle to the development of tourism and foreign
investment; and

         - A variety of environmental challenges, including natural and man-made
disasters, management problems of solid waste and military waste,
degradation of arable land and forest resources, water and air pollution, and
the slow development and implementation of acceptable environmental
protection standards and conventions.

### Security Priorities

**General Security. The security priorities of Bosnia and Herzegovina are:**

         - The protection of constitutional order and constitutionally guaranteed human
rights and freedoms;

         - The development of a self-sustaining economy as a precondition for
independence, improvement of living standards, and accession to the
European Union; and

         - Accession to and membership in collective security systems.

**Economic Security. Bosnia and Herzegovina will undertake efforts to achieve faster**
economic growth, higher living standards and the development of functional social
programmes and mechanisms of economic assistance for citizens. The key element to
economic stability, self sustainability and security for the people of Bosnia and
Herzegovina is accession to the European Union.

**Military Security. Bosnia and Herzegovina embraces without any limitation the concept**
of collective security as the keystone of its own military strategy. Based on this, it seeks
membership in the NATO and other security alliances, as soon as possible, as the basis
for the selection of strategic bilateral partners.

                              - 14

### III

 THE DEFENCE POLICY OF BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA

The Defence Policy of Bosnia and Herzegovina is an important part of the internal and foreign
policies of Bosnia and Herzegovina. As such, it was built on strategic principles that are suitable
to the foreign and security policies of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and it is the result of
consideration of the wider security environment. The Defence Policy defines the key elements of
the defence system and their functioning, including the Armed Forces of Bosnia and
Herzegovina as the most important element of the system.

### Strategic Principles of the Defence Policy of Bosnia and Herzegovina

The Defence Policy of Bosnia and Herzegovina is based on the following strategic principles:

    - Democratic, civilian control of the military with parliamentary oversight;

    - Transparency of defence activities to include defence planning and budgeting;

    - A balance of forces and capabilities within Bosnia and Herzegovina, the immediate
sub-region and South Eastern Europe;

    - Modernisation of forces to include developing interoperability both within the Armed
Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina and with NATO;

    - Integration into Euro-Atlantic collective security structures; and

    - Co-operation in the field of arms control and confidence- and security-building
measures, to include participation in South East Europe security structures and
protocols.

By establishing a defence system based on these principles, Bosnia and Herzegovina shall fulfil
the goals of defence reform and advance further along the path from individual to collective
security.

### Integration into Euro-Atlantic Collective Security Structures

Bosnia and Herzegovina clearly understands and embraces the concept of collective military
security as the keystone of our long-term military strategy. The key to achieving unquestionable
collective military security is to become a member of NATO, since Bosnia and Herzegovina’s
national sovereignty and territorial integrity would then be guaranteed by the entire Alliance.

                              - 15 

-----

**Partnership for Peace. Although membership in NATO's Partnership for Peace**
programme does not bring the same collective security guarantees as full NATO
membership, it is a first step in that direction.

The Partnership for Peace was established as an expression of common beliefs that
stability and security in the Euro-Atlantic region can be achieved only through cooperation and joint action. The protection and promotion of basic freedoms and human
rights, preservation of freedoms, justice and peace through democracy are common
Partnership for Peace values that are completely shared by Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Bosnia and Herzegovina is committed to the accomplishment of Partnership for Peace
goals, particularly through increased transparency in defence planning and budgeting, full
democratic control of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and co-operation
with the NATO in order to strengthen Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina
capabilities to act in concert with NATO member forces.

Thanks to ongoing co-operation with NATO as well as bilateral co-operation with many
Alliance members, Bosnia and Herzegovina has already achieved substantial and visible
results in many areas, such as transparency of defence planning and budgeting and
democratic control of the armed forces.

Bosnia and Herzegovina anticipates continued co-operation with NATO in order to
improve the capabilities of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina to co-operate
with the forces of NATO member states and Partnership for Peace states.

                         - 16 

-----

**Partnership for Peace/NATO Standardisation and Interoperability. One of the basic**
principles for the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina is to organise, staff, equip
and train forces so as to achieve interoperability among the two entity armies and with
NATO and partner state forces.

The ultimate goal is to achieve interoperability with NATO across the full range of
defence functions, from the highest levels of defence policy decision-making through the
operational and tactical levels of military responsibility.

Achieving standardisation and interoperability will be a long-term process. Ultimately,
these initiatives will enable our forces to conduct effective training and joint operations
both within Bosnia and Herzegovina and with military forces of partner states, in an
effective and efficient manner.

When Bosnia and Herzegovina becomes a Partnership for Peace member, it shall develop
an Individual Partnership Programme (IPP), identifying its desired areas of co-operation
with NATO.

Bosnia and Herzegovina, being aware of its resources and situation, wants to establish
co-operation with NATO, with priorities in the areas that will enhance the establishment
of command, control, communication and information systems, planning and budgeting,
resource management and training and equipping; these will facilitate internal and
external interoperability, and thus enhance the operational capabilities of the Armed
Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina, particularly with respect to peace support and
humanitarian operations.

As a priority, Bosnia and Herzegovina wishes to develop partnership relations in the
following areas:

  - Command and control, including communications and information systems,
navigation and identification systems, interoperability, procedures and
technology;

  - Defence planning, budgeting and resource management; and

  - Concepts, planning and operational aspects of peace support operations.

In addition, Bosnia and Herzegovina is ready to develop co-operation in other areas, such
as:

  - Humanitarian demining;

  - Military education, training and doctrine;

  - Small arms and light weapons;

  - The study of foreign languages;

  - International humanitarian law;

                         - 17

       - Civil emergency planning;

       - Defence policy and strategy;

       - Military geography;

       - Military infrastructure;

       - Airspace control and management; and

       - The fight against terrorism, organised crime and human trafficking.

### Bilateral and Multilateral Defence Co-operation Programmes 

Bosnia and Herzegovina is committed to establishing and improving bilateral and multilateral
defence relationships with all interested countries, based on the principles of mutual respect and
co-operation.

The Peace Support Operations Training Centre (PSOTC) in Butmir near Sarajevo is a joint
project of more than a dozen states, with the primary purpose of providing training for Armed
Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina officers as well as officers from other states, in order to
facilitate more effective participation in multinational environments during exercises, peace
support and humanitarian operations. The PSOTC may also serve as the nucleus of an advanced
education system for the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

The Regional Arms Control Verification and Implementation Centre (RACVIAC) in Zagreb
(Croatia) is established under the auspices of the South East Europe Stability Pact in order to
provide a forum for closer co-operation between the countries in the region, in the areas of arms
control and the promotion of confidence- and security-building measures. Bosnia and
Herzegovina is one of twenty-one countries that actively participate in the work of the
RACVIAC.

The Baltic Defence College (BALTDEFCOL), a joint project of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and
other partners, has been particularly useful for the professional development of our officer corps.
The George C. Marshall Centre for Security Studies, a joint American-German project, has
provided useful courses and seminars on a variety of topics. The NATO School in
Oberammergau, the Geneva Centre for Security Policy and the NATO Staff College in Rome are
some of the other institutions that have also made great contributions to professional
development and specialised training.

In addition to these programmes, China, Croatia, Hungary, Italy, Japan, France, Germany,
Greece, Malaysia, Norway, Romania, Slovenia, Switzerland, Serbia and Montenegro, Turkey,
the United Kingdom and other states have helped to enhance the expertise and professionalism
of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina through significant programmes of defence cooperation.

                              - 18 

-----

The United States of America furnishes significant military assistance to the Armed Forces of
Bosnia and Herzegovina through the Foreign Military Financing (FMF) Programme, the
International Military Education and Training (IMET) Programme, and the Joint Contact Team
Programme (JCTP). Bosnia and Herzegovina has signed an Acquisition and Cross-Servicing
Agreement (ACSA) with the United States that facilitates mutual support for a wide range of
projects. The State Partnership Programme between Bosnia and Herzegovina and the State of
Maryland has demonstrated the potential to establish long-term, sustainable relationships in both
the military and the civilian spheres. Through implementation of these and other initiatives and
programmes, Bosnia and Herzegovina expects that the United States will remain a key strategic
partner.

Through these and other types of co-operation, Bosnia and Herzegovina seeks to strengthen and
promote external ties and to further develop the expertise and professionalism of the Armed
Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

### Contribution to Regional Co-operation in South East Europe

By virtue of its geo-strategic position and overall characteristics, Bosnia and Herzegovina is very
important to the stability of South East Europe. Therefore, Bosnia and Herzegovina should make
a maximum effort to improve relations and co-operation between countries and peoples in the
region.

Bosnia and Herzegovina, due to its national structure, is well-placed to help bring the peoples in
the region closer together. By actively helping to find solutions and to create regional
programmes, Bosnia and Herzegovina will improve its role and significance in regional cooperation by:

  - Developing intensive and comprehensive bilateral relations with all countries in the
region, particularly neighbours;

  - Proposing that Sarajevo become permanent headquarters of the Stability Pact for South
East Europe;

  - Proposing initiatives in the process of implementing the Agreement on Regional Arms
Control;

  - Strengthening confidence building measures at the regional level; and

  - Consistently implementing the Agreement on Sub-Regional Arms Control.

                              - 19 

-----

Bosnia and Herzegovina shall continue to
participate in activities of the NATO South
East Europe Initiative, directed towards the
harmonisation and support of regional
security and defence co-operation, as well as
other specific projects.

Bosnia and Herzegovina is determined to
accept and develop other forms of cooperation in the area of defence, at different
regional levels.

### Special Arrangements

NATO engagement in Bosnia and Herzegovina was of crucial importance for the
establishment and maintenance of peace and stability in the post-Dayton period. After nine years
of engagement in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the NATO Stabilisation Force (SFOR) will complete
its mission in December 2004. According to the Berlin Plus Agreement between NATO and the
European Union, European Union forces have replaced NATO forces for the peace stabilisation
mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

European Union forces will strengthen and support the progress of Bosnia and Herzegovina
towards the European integration.

                                 - 2 

-----

Bosnia and Herzegovina welcomes the engagement of the European Union as an indicator of the
progress made towards achieving peace and stability.

Upon the withdrawal of NATO forces from Bosnia and Herzegovina, NATO will continue to
work on the implementation of current arrangements in defence reform and the restructuring of
the Bosnia and Herzegovina defence system. For that purpose NATO will establish a
headquarters in Sarajevo and the Greek Embassy in Sarajevo will serve as the Partnership for
Peace point of contact. The intention is to further the implementation of defence reform and to
improve understanding and co-operation between Bosnia and Herzegovina and NATO.

                              - 21

### IV

 THE DEFENCE SYSTEM OF BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA

 Democratic Control of the Armed Forces 

Democratic control of the Armed Forces was established by defence system reforms in
accordance with the practice and standards of democratic European countries, and it is
implemented through civilian command over the Armed Forces and democratic parliamentary
oversight.

**Civilian Command.**

Civilian command over the Armed Forces is implemented through democratically
selected bodies – the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Ministry of Defence.
The Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, acting by consensus, exercises supreme
operational and administrative command and control of the Armed Forces in peace and in
wartime. Based on the constitutional position and legal competencies, the Presidency
decides on the use and deployment of the Armed Forces in wartime operations or during
emergencies in the country, the deployment of the forces in peace support operations
abroad, the structure and size of the Armed Forces, and appointments and removals of
General Officers. The Presidency adopts doctrinal documents and recommends or
requests the Parliamentary Assembly to declare a state of war or emergency.

                              - 22 

-----

Based on Decisions of the Presidency, the Minister of Defence issues bylaws, directives,
regulations and orders for the organisation, training, equipment, deployment and use of
the Armed Forces. The Minister of Defence develops the Bosnia and Herzegovina
defence budget. He is positioned at the head of the strategic planning chain for armed
conflicts, peace support operations and natural disaster response; he exercises command
and control of military intelligence activities; and recommends appointments and
removals of General Officers to the Presidency. The Minister of Defence is authorised to
oversee, monitor and inspect the Armed Forces at all levels.

**Parliamentary Oversight.**

Parliamentary oversight of the Armed Forces is implemented through the Parliamentary
Assembly of Bosnia and Herzegovina and entity Parliamentary Assemblies, in accordance
with their competencies in the field of defence. The Parliament of Bosnia and
Herzegovina has the supreme authority to declare states of war or emergency, to issue
laws, and to oversee and investigate issues related to the organisation, funding, staffing,
training, equipment, deployment and use of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and
Herzegovina. The Parliamentary Assembly also confirms appointments of General
Officers.

Entity Parliamentary Assemblies exercise democratic parliamentary oversight over entity
armies and defence structures in the entities on those aspects of funding, organisation,
training, staffing and equipment for which the entities have competencies. They also
adopt the entity defence budgets.

In order to implement parliamentary oversight, the Parliamentary Assembly of Bosnia and
Herzegovina and entity Parliamentary Assemblies establish appropriate working bodies –
committees that directly deal with the above-mentioned issues.

### Transparency in Defence Planning and Budgeting

The defence of Bosnia and Herzegovina requires significant human and material resources;
therefore, transparency is very important to the process of defence planning and funding. These
two functions, carried out at the State level by the Bosnia and Herzegovina Ministry of Defence,
establish the necessary relationships between military strategies, methods to implement those
strategies, and the means to obtain the necessary resources. Therefore, information on those
issues must be accessible to elected officials and citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The
principle of transparency must be applied throughout the entire defence system and it has to be
clearly demonstrated that the resources supporting that system are under the control of elected
civilian officials.

**Defence Planning.**

Defence planning within Bosnia and Herzegovina is a complex process of interrelated
elements, beginning with the definition of challenges, goals, missions and resources, and
leading to the distribution of resources among defence tasks. The end result of the
planning process is a comprehensive and consistent set of plans that express how the
Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina contribute to the security of Bosnia and
Herzegovina and its citizens, and how they help to comply with international obligations.

                              - 23 

-----

Defence planning is a continuous process of evaluation and decision-making on issues of
interest for the state. The process identifies the interests of Bosnia and Herzegovina, challenges
and _risks to the security of Bosnia and Herzegovina, defence objectives, defence_ _strategy,_ _own_
_forces, friends and allies and – based on all of that – assessment and funding priorities. From_
this analysis and subsequent decisions, resources are planned, programmed and budgeted to
enable the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina to respond to the defence challenges of the
State of Bosnia and Herzegovina. This process could be illustrated as follows:

The basic principles for defence planning and force structure planning for the Armed
Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina are _credibility, affordability, and_ _applicability. This_
means that the forces established as a result of defence planning are able to respond to the
defence challenges that Bosnia and Herzegovina is facing, that the size of the Armed
Forces corresponds with the economic situation of the State, and that the Armed Forces
can be used in an effective and timely manner.

                              - 24 

-----

**Defence Budgeting and the Common Defence Resource Management System.** The
Bosnia and Herzegovina defence system is funded from a budget comprised of three
parts: the State budget and two entity budgets. The development and proposal of defence
budgets is co-ordinated by the Bosnia and Herzegovina Minister of Defence. The method
and procedures for governing this process make up the Bosnia and Herzegovina Common
Defence Resource Management System, the major operating component of which is the
Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution System (PPBES). The PPBES is a
comprehensive management system that connects strategy, operations, and resources.
Resources in the defence sector include people, supplies and equipment, facilities,
information management, communication capability, transportation, force structure,
information, time, and money. The ultimate goal of the Common Defence Resource
Management System is to achieve the greatest degree of security at the least cost, while
applying scarce defence resources in an efficient and cost effective manner to address
those military tasks most critical to the security of the State.

### The Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina

Pursuant to the Bosnia and Herzegovina Law on Defence, the Armed Forces of Bosnia and
Herzegovina consist of “all military forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina, whether organised by
state or entity institutions. The Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina include the Army of
Republika Srpska and the Army of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Army of the
Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina was legally established in 1996 from the units of the
Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina Army and Croat Council of Defence (HVO).” These
military forces encompass “…all formations and units, both combat and support, of the land,
naval, air and air defence forces organised by state or entity institutions of Bosnia and
Herzegovina.”

**The Mission of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina.**

The State of Bosnia and Herzegovina organises, develops, and maintains the military
capability and preparedness of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina in order to:

       - “Ensure its sovereignty, territorial integrity, political independence, and
international personality;

       - Promote its foreign policy objectives;

       - Fulfil international obligations of Bosnia and Herzegovina; and

       - Protect the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina.”

Furthermore, the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina are responsible:

       - “To carry out military training for combat and other forms of military defence;

       - To assure combat readiness;

       - To provide military defence of the state in the event of an attack;

                              - 25 

-----

  - To assist civil protection authorities in responding to natural disasters and
accidents; and

  - To fulfil the international obligations of Bosnia and Herzegovina.”

**Command and Control of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina***

The Armed Forces of the Bosnia and Herzegovina include all the military forces in Bosnia
and Herzegovina organized by state or entity institutions. The Armed Forces of Bosnia and
Herzegovina include Army of Republika Srpska and Army of Federation of Bosnia and
Herzegovina. The Army of Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina was legally established in
1996 by units of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croat Defence
Council. The state of Bosnia and Herzegovina ensures transparent, democratic, civilian control
over the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina and performs the operational and
administrative command and control over the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The
Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, acting in accordance with the concensus, is performing
the supreme operational and administrative command and control of the Armed Forces of Bosnia
and Herzegovina.
______________________________________________________________________________

- In accordance with the Decision on Extending the Mandate of the Defence Reform Commission by the High
Representative on 31[st] December 2004 there will probably be changes to the command and control arrangements of
Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina. During the course of 2005, the Defence Reform Commission is tasked to
examine and propose legal and institutional measures necessary to enhance State level command and control,
promote cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, achieve fiscal
sustainability, strengthen parliamentary oversight, and promote development of a single military force by transferring
the competencies of the Entity Ministries of Defence to the level of the State of Bosnia and Herzegovina and
implement further the Commission’s recommendations.

                              - 27 

-----

**_Operational Chain of Command_**

The Bosnia and Herzegovina Law on Defence of 2003 defines _operational_
_command and control as “…the authority to assign military missions or tasks to_
subordinate commanders, to deploy units, to reassign forces, and to retain or
delegate operational or tactical control.” The Operational Chain of Command
“…begins with the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, goes to the Minister of
Defence of Bosnia and Herzegovina, to the Chief of Staff of the Joint Staff of
Bosnia and Herzegovina, to the Commander of the Operational Command, and
then to commanders of operational units.”

**_Administrative Chain of Command_**

The Bosnia and Herzegovina Law on Defence of 2003 defines administrative
command and control as “…the direction or exercise of authority for
administrative matters such as organising, manning, equipping, and training the
Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina.” The Administrative Chain of
Command “…begins with the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina and goes to
the Minister of Defence. For military forces organised at the entity level, the
administrative chain of command then goes to the entity Ministers of Defence and
then through the entity army chains of command. For military forces organised at
the State level, the administrative chain of command goes to the Chief of Staff of
the Joint Staff and then to subordinate administrative commands.”

**_Single Military Force_**

The final and perhaps crowning element in corroborating the fact that the Armed
Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina are a “single military force” will be the
establishment of a common Defence Budget for the Armed Forces of Bosnia and
Herzegovina. In order to achieve this, it is necessary to meet certain
preconditions, as follows: first, full implementation of a Value Added Tax (VAT)
for Bosnia and Herzegovina, which will provide significant revenues for the State
of Bosnia and Herzegovina and thereby reduce dependence on funding from the
budgets of the two entities; and second, political consensus on relevant factors in
Bosnia and Herzegovina and the subsequent enactment of appropriate legal
regulations on a common defence budget.

**Size of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina.**

The size and structure of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina was established
by the Presidency Decision of 24 March 2004, with total of 12,000 professional soldiers,
12,600 conscripts and 60,000 reservists. According to the Decision, the Army of
Republika Sprska is authorised 4,000 professional soldiers, 4,200 conscripts, and 20,000
reservists. The Army of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina is authorised 8,000
professional soldiers (5,576 Bosniaks and 2,424 Croats), 8,400 conscripts (6,416 Bosniaks
and 1,986 Croats), and 40,000 reservists (28,750 Bosniaks and 11,250 Croats).
Conscripts serve their period of conscription in the training structures of the entity armies.

The Bosnia and Herzegovina Law on Defence of 2003 assures that “The right of
conscientious objection shall be secured to all persons who are subject to the common
conscription policy.” The right of conscientious objection shall be regulated by separate
law and relevant entity and State authorities are already taking actions in that direction.
The first conscripts have already served their period of conscription in alternative civilian
service.

**Major Military Elements.**

The major elements of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina include three active
duty manoeuvre brigades, air force and air defence commands and units, associated
administrative, training and logistical support commands and units, and six reserve
divisions. The Army of Republika Srpska has one mechanised brigade and two reserve
divisions. The Army of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina has one mechanised
brigade, one armoured brigade, and four reserve divisions.

**Training and Education.**

The quality of a professional military force is reflected in its level of training. The
citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina expect that the officers, non-commissioned officers,
and soldiers of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina are trained for all tasks
neceessary to accomplish Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina missions. According
to the Bosnia and Herzegovina Law on Defence of 2003, the ministries of defence of the
two entities, Republika Srpska and the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, are
responsible for training and education of members of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and
Herzegovina. However, that training is organised and conducted in accordance with a
common training doctrine, tasks and standards established by the Bosnia and Herzegovina
Minister of Defence.

**_Individual Training_**

All conscripts undergo basic, individual and specialised training during their four
months’ period of conscription. In Republika Srpska, this training is conducted in
two conscript training centres, Banja Luka (Manjaca) and Bileca. In the
Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, individual conscript training is conducted
in six centres: Capljina, Bugojno, Bihac, Zenica, Gorazde and Tuzla.

**_Collective Training_**

Through the process of individual training, members of the Armed Forces gain
basic military knowledge and skills, which are preconditions for collective
training. No matter how trained and skilled individual soldiers may be, the
essence of an effective military unit is the ability to operate as a team to
accomplish a mission.

                              - 30 

-----

In the Armed Forces of Bosnia and
Herzegovina, the majority of
collective training is carried out to
train basic combat and tactical units at
the company or battery level.

There is also special collective
training: simulation training,
conducted in training centres or in the
field, to train unit commanders and
staffs to carry out joint actions.

In Republika Srpska, collective training is conducted in the training centres noted above
and at the Centre for Officer Advanced Training in Banja Luka (Zaluzani). It is planned to equip
the Centre with equipment for combat simulation at the battalion and brigade level, or for
simulation of military actions in natural and man-made disasters and accidents.

In the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, collective training is also conducted in the training
centres noted above, and at the Combat Simulation Centre in Pazaric near Sarajevo, which is
currently the only equipped centre for combat simulation in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Joint collective training involving military units from both the Army of Republika
Srpska and the Army of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina was conducted
for the first time in the spring of 2004, when engineering elements from both
armies successfully collaborated in construction of a bridge as part of a wider
exercise based on a natural disaster scenario. As Bosnia and Herzegovina
becomes a member of NATO's Partnership for Peace programme, we anticipate
an increasing number of opportunities for joint collective training between
elements of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina and forces from NATO
and partner nations.

                              - 31 

-----

**_Professional Development_**

Professionalisation of the officer and NCO corps is a key objective for the Armed Forces
of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The size of the Armed Forces and the limited resources available in
Bosnia and Herzegovina require the most rational approach to the education and advanced
training of NCO and officer personnel. In that context, only limited internal training and
advanced training capacities are being developed, while the specialised and advanced training of
officers and NCOs is conducted at military schools and other institutions abroad.

Training centres for officers in the entity armies are designed to meet
requirements for ongoing military training and simulation training. Reserve
officers of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina are also trained in these
centres. Advanced and specialised training for officers and NCOs of different
services and branches in Republika Srpska and the Federation of Bosnia and
Herzegovina is normally conducted abroad.

The training of officers for the highest command duties is conducted in relevant
institutions of the armed forces in several foreign countries, based on bilateral
agreements on co-operation.

**_English Language Training_**

The functional language in NATO military headquarters is English. In order to be
able to operate in co-operation with or as an integral part of NATO military
forces, we must be able to communicate in English. Accordingly, the Armed
Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina has an advanced program to develop English
language proficiency in both the officer and NCO corps. The United Kingdom
has been particularly helpful in supporting these efforts through the British
Council, as has the Defence Language Institute of the United States.

                              - 32 

-----

Approximately 1150 members of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina have attended
various English language classes, some 400 from the Army of Republika Srpska and
approximately 750 from the Army of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

**Employment of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina.**

**_Peace Support Operations_**

Bosnia and Herzegovina is determined to become an active participant in
international peace support operations, rather than being a beneficiary of such
efforts. Bosnia and Herzegovina is ready to give its knowledge, experience and
resources to meet this aim. Officers from Bosnia and Herzegovina have
successfully served as UN observers in Congo, Eritrea and Ethiopia.

**_Demining and Explosive Ordnance Disposal Operations_**

Bosnia and Herzegovina has several hundred thousand landmines and large
quantities of unexploded ordnance that pose a real danger to its citizens and
obstruct economic development. For this reason, significant military resources
are dedicated to demining and the destruction of unexploded ordnance. These
tasks are performed by specialised de-mining teams of the Armed Forces of
Bosnia and Herzegovina. Currently, 36 demining teams are trained and engaged
in demining activities in Bosnia and Herzegovina: 20 teams from the Army of the
Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and 16 teams from the Army of Republika
Srpska.

                              - 33 

-----

Due to the extensive experience
gained in this field, Bosnia and
Herzegovina is readily able to
offer demining units and units
for explosive ordnance
destruction as its contribution
to peace support operations.

**_Assistance to Civilian Authorities_**

The Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina can be employed to assist civilian authorities in
dealing with natural and man-made disasters and accidents. Due to the significance of such tasks,
the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina plan, organise and conduct training of commands,
units and members in order to prepare them for these missions. Training is conducted in
accordance with the technical resources and expertise of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and
Herzegovina for providing assistance to civilian authorities.

                              - 34 

-----

**Military Personnel.**

Upon joining the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina for the first time, all
members take the following oath: “I solemnly pledge to defend the sovereignty, territorial
integrity, constitutional order, and political independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina and
to carry out, responsibly and conscientiously, all duties necessary for its defence.”

According to the Bosnia and Herzegovina Law on Defence, the Armed Forces of Bosnia
and Herzegovina are apolitical and “... cannot be used for political purposes of partyrelated activities.” “Members of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina, including
General officers, shall remain neutral in political matters, shall not engage in partisan
political activities of any kind and shall not hold elected or appointed public office.”
Additionally, officers cannot “hold a financial interest that conflicts with the
conscientious performance of their duty or engage in outside employment or any other
activities that conflict with official duties and responsibilities.”

They also are duty-bound to protect and conserve government property, to use
government property only for authorized purposes, and to report possible irregularities
and corruption through their chains of command. These and other provisions of the law
ensure that the peoples and citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina can place their highest
degree of confidence in the officers, non-commissioned officers and soldiers of their
armed forces.

                         - 35 

-----

**_The Officer Corps_**

The officer corps of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina is trained and
experienced, able to perform duties in their military areas of specialisation from
professional, tactical and technical aspects. A significant number of officers are
receiving training in accordance with NATO programmes and standards, ranging
from developing military strategy documents to planning and implementing
policies and procedures to achieve interoperability with NATO forces. The
officer corps represents the command structure of the Armed Forces of Bosnia
and Herzegovina and it is extremely important for the successful implementation
of the Armed Forces’ missions.

**_The Non-Commissioned Officer (NCO) Corps_**

A trained and professional non-commissioned officer corps is the backbone of
most modern armies, including the armed forces of NATO nations. In the Armed
Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina great consideration is given to the process of
developing a non-commissioned officer corps.

**_Soldiers_**

In peacetime, soldiers of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina are
volunteers – professional soldiers – or conscripts serving their conscription
service in the entity armies and members of reserves mobilised in the military
service.

Many of the persons serving in the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina in
peacetime and wartime are persons subject to compulsory military service,
mobilised in the Armed Forces or serving their conscription service. According to
the law, the Bosnia and Herzegovina Minister of Defence is responsible to
develop a common conscription policy. The duration of conscription is regulated
by entity law and it is currently four months long.

**_Reserves_**

The reserves of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina are comprised of
soldiers, non-commissioned officers and officers who have completed their
conscription service and who are called up or mobilised for training, depending
on training requirements and programmes. Equipping and training programmes
for reserves, based on common standards at the State level, are organised and
conducted by the entity authorities.

**_Common Personnel Management System_**

The Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina are now designing and
implementing a common personnel management system as set forth in the Bosnia
and Herzegovina Law on Defence of 2003. Additionally, various administrative
policies and programmes will support this system. A “Uniforms, Ranks &
Insignia Policy” will ensure a professional, uniform appearance within all

                    - 36 

-----

elements of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina. And, even more
critically, a new “Pay and Benefits Policy” will harmonise the status of all Armed
Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina members.

The policies and procedures noted above will be supplemented by a Civilian
Personnel Management System developed in co-operation with the Bosnia and
Herzegovina Civil Service Agency, for civilian personnel in the defence sector.
A Civilian Personnel Management System is necessary in order to plan and
manage the professional development of civil servants in accordance with
requirements of the Bosnia and Herzegovina defence system.

The application of these systems will guarantee the professional development of
personnel in the defence sector, and effective and efficient human resource
management, in order to provide the greatest degree of security to the peoples and
citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

                    - 37 

-----

### V

 THE WAY AHEAD

The Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina exist to ensure the security of Bosnia and
Herzegovina, the well-being of its peoples and citizens, and compliance with our international
obligations. In doing so, Bosnia and Herzegovina is committed to the principles of democratic,
civilian control of the military and transparency in all aspects of defence. Bosnia and
Herzegovina is committed to further defence reforms along the lines that have brought Bosnia
and Herzegovina to the very doorstep of NATO’s Partnership for Peace programme. Bosnia and
Herzegovina is also committed to organise, staff, equip, train, and maintain its forces in order to
provide the greatest degree of security at the least cost to its citizens, and to ensure the peace and
prosperity to all.

The vision of the Bosnia and Herzegovina Minister of Defence for the future of the Armed
Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina is summarised in the following words:

**“The Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina will be small, well-equipped, mobile**
**forces of well trained and motivated soldiers led by highly qualified officers and**
**non-commissioned officers and supported by skilled and professional civilian**
**personnel. Those forces, to include reserves, will be internally compatible and**
**interoperable with NATO forces. A fully transparent and balanced defence**
**planning, programming, budgeting and execution process will ensure that the forces**
**are organised, manned, equipped, trained, and maintained to accomplish all**
**missions assigned by the civilian leadership of Bosnia and Herzegovina.”**

With the continued support by the peoples and citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina, we
face the future with the confident expectation of success.
