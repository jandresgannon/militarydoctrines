### The Military Doctrine of the Republic of Belarus'

#### Dr Steven J Main

_The new Belorussian military doctrine strongly emphases the principle of_
_collectivity in regional security; its main military relationships are with_
_Russia and the signatories of the Treaty on Collective Security. Belarus'_
_should not therefore be seen as a destabilising influence in military terms._

Formally passed into law on 3[rd] January 2002, the new military doctrine of the
Republic of Belarus' is, in the words of the doctrine itself, "the sum total of the
central, official views and principles safeguarding the military security of the state
by the use of political and military measures. It consolidates the basic directions of
the state's military policy in the modern period, as well as determines its attitude
towards military conflicts and their prevention, military organisation, the use of
military force for the defence of the state's vitally important interests."[1]  To avoid
any possible confusion, it should not be forgotten that although both countries
have their own national military doctrines,[2] there is now also a single military
doctrine for the Union State of Russia and Belarus', approved at the end of
December 2001.[3] However, according to the Belarussian Defence Minister, ColonelGeneral L Mal'tsev, the new Union State military doctrine does not contradict or
conflict with any of the provisions contained in either of the two national military
doctrines.[4]

The new Belarussian military doctrine replaces the original doctrine of the
Belarussian Republic, passed in December 1992 and differs from its predecessor in
a number of important aspects, not least in the rejection of the concept of neutrality
and in detailing a much closer relationship with its big, eastern neighbour, Russia.[5]
One should be careful not to draw the wrong inferences from this, ie that Belarus' is
becoming more "aggressive" and consequently more of a potential future security
problem for its neighbours. That part of Europe has seen significant political
change since the first Belarussian military doctrine was adopted almost a decade
ago and in many ways the new doctrine simply reflects an official Belarussian
interpretation of how things have changed in the region in particular, as well as
globally. This paper will seek to place the new doctrine in its historical, as well as
contemporary, context and offer a balanced interpretation of how the country now
views its place on the modern European stage.

#### The New Military Doctrine in its Historical Context

Although the Republic's first military doctrine has not been published, nevertheless
it is still possible to say a few things about its content - the first military doctrine
penned by any of the republics of the fSU.[6] As does the 2002 doctrine, the 1992
doctrine "reflected the views of the leadership of the country on the questions of war
and peace, the development of the country's defences, the training of the armed
forces to repel aggression, ways of conducting the armed struggle in the interests of

defending sovereignty and the territorial integrity of the country".[7] However,
Belarus' then, under the leadership of S Shushkevich, was a very different country
from Belarus' now, under A Lukashenko. This is reflected in the 1992 doctrine:
according to one report, the earlier doctrine "declares [the country] to be in a state
of armed neutrality, to have the status of a non-nuclear power and refuses to join
military blocs and alliances".[8] Thus, whilst Belarus' is still a non-nuclear power - a
fact which the Belarussian president has publicly regretted on a number of
occasions - the ideas of "armed neutrality" and not being a member of any military
bloc or alliance have long passed. Suffice it to say that the phrase "armed
neutrality" does not appear anywhere in the new doctrine and, as for refusal to join
any military bloc or alliance, one has only to look at the very close relationship
between the military establishments of Russia and Belarus' to understand how that
idea has also receded into the country's past. Of course, a close military
relationship between the two republics was always on the cards - not least because
of the strategic importance of Belarus' to the defence of the Russian Federation, but
also because of the economic importance of Russia to Belarus' (last year alone,
Russia accounted for 75% of Belarussian manufacturing industry's exports: in
total, the trade turnover between both countries last year amounted to 11 billion
rubles, 500 million rubles more than trade between Russia and China)[9] - and,
although there is no formal military alliance (soyuz) between them, there is an
impressive list of treaties, agreements, joint concepts, signed over the years in the
military and security spheres which just falls short of a formal military alliance.[10]
No other country has such a long list of agreements in the military and security
spheres with the Russian Federation and there is every indication that the military
cooperation between the two states will develop further.

The 1992 doctrine consisted of two sections: "military-political" and "militarytechnical". The military-political part contains the concepts of 'preventative war'

[predotvrashcheniye _voyny] and 'suppression of aggression' [presecheniye agressii]._
Actualising the concept of 'preventative war' entails the conduct of a political
dialogue to solve matters under dispute, refraining from the use of military force,
strengthening the role of the UN in solving issues of collective security. The
doctrine also declares the necessity of interacting with interested states to create a
'nuclear-free belt' from the Baltic to the Black Sea, the complete and unequivocal
ban on nuclear weapons in the region. Belorussia is against participation in the
military conflicts of other states without the corresponding UN sanctions. [It also]
declares a ban on the use of the territory of the republic for the conduct of combat
operations by other countries, as well as the deployment of troops and military
bases of foreign states."[11]

Again, there is little in the new doctrine which bears any resemblance to the above.
Whilst there is a reference in the new doctrine to using the offices of the UN during
a period of threat, or in the early stages of an armed conflict, to try to bring about
peace,[12] there is no mention of the desirability or necessity of creating a nuclearfree zone in the region, nor banning the use of the territory of the Republic for the
deployment of foreign troops or for the creation of foreign military bases (just as
well, really, given the Russian military bases in Belarus' - at Vileyka and at
Gantsevichi).[13]

There are also a number of other significant differences between the two doctrines,
particularly in the area of analysing how to prevent war from breaking out, or the
best plan of action to pursue once military action has been embarked upon. In the
1992 doctrine, the "suppression of aggression" was defined as follows: "the
application of economic measures and diplomatic pressure with the aim of forcing

##### 2

the aggressor to refrain from preparing for a military invasion of the territory of the
republic. The use of the armed forces to repel aggression is only permitted when all
other non-military measures have proved ineffective."[14] There is no mention of the
means to be used to encourage restraint on the part of the potential aggressor. In
the new doctrine, as will be detailed below, there is a lot of emphasis on the issue of
"collectivity" in ensuring the defence of the Republic, as well as the military utility of
the agreements with Russia and the potential use of the joint Russian-Belarussian
military force in the region (the Regional Grouping of Troops - "RGV") should
military conflict break out.[15] In this respect, the change in emphasis from "armed
neutrality" to "collectivity" in the military sphere can be interpreted simply as a sign
of the changed security picture in that part of Europe, as a result of the redeployment of the military force of the fSU; the break-up of Yugoslavia; the
expansion of NATO; the election of Lukashenko, not once but twice; the ever
deepening relationship between the militaries in Belarus' and Russia over the past
decade, etc.

The next section of the 1992 doctrine, the "military-technical" section, also
contained material which was destined not to appear ten years later:

"the military-technical part of the doctrine includes the concepts of
'containment', [sderzhivaniye] and 'active defence' [aktivnaya oborona].
The concept of 'containment' contains a definition of the status of
Russian strategic forces temporarily deployed on the territory of the
republic and regulating their use. In accordance with the concept,
Belorussia has the right to take part in the adoption of decisions
permitting or forbidding the use of the strategic forces. It should also be
noted that following the withdrawal of the strategic forces of the Russian
Federation from the territory of the republic, the concept of 'containment'
will either be fundamentally re-examined or abandoned.

"The concept of 'active defence' means military cooperation with other
states, the existence of one's own armed forces and mobile defence.
Cooperation may be realised in the sphere of devising plans for the
purchase of weapons and military technology, the training of cadres, the
development of infrastructure of a defensive importance. The
development of one's own armed forces is the presence of a system for
staffing [the Armed Forces] and of a centralised leadership of the Armed
Forces, the balanced development of all types of troops with priority
being attached to defensive forces and means, the possibility of
increasing combat might in the face of the growing military threat.
Mobile defence must be maintained by including in the armed forces
small but powerful groups, geared towards flexible operations in the
event of the start of any real threat."[16]

Some of this did not appear in the 2002 doctrine because, with the final removal of
all nuclear weapons by the end of 1996, for instance, there was no need for
provision to be made for the republic's role in the decision-making process in the
use, or non-use, of nuclear weapons. But the ideas surrounding "active defence"
were also not mentioned in the 2002 doctrine, possibly because given the
agreements signed with Russia, particularly since 1995, military cooperation has
tended to largely focus on this relationship, rather than those with other states.
The extensive nature of the cooperation between Russian and Belarus' in the
military and security spheres almost precludes Belarus' from developing any other
meaningful relationship. Back in July 1992, the then Belarussian Minister of

Defence, Colonel-General P Kozlovskiy, emphasised not only the country's nonnuclear status, but also its neutrality: "Our country will be non-nuclear and
neutral. Namely in this lies the basis of our military doctrine, its essence … If we
look at the question of forming various military blocs and alliances, then Belarus'
occupies here the firm position of neutrality."[17] Contrast this with the words and
spirit of the 2002 doctrine …

#### The 2002 Military Doctrine

According to one source, the new military doctrine was worked out involving
"military and civilian specialists over a comparatively long time."[18] It was certainly
discussed at a session of the Republic's Security Council in May 2001.[19] A
newspaper report in September 2001 also mentioned the work of a Standing
Commission on National Security preparing a draft law on "the military doctrine of
the Republic of Belarus" and listed the "priorities" of the draft law as "defending the
state's sovereignty and political independence, as well as safeguarding the territorial
integrity and inviolability of the state's borders".[20] The draft law received its first
reading in the lower house of the Belarussian parliament in October 2001. In
presenting it to parliament at the time, General Mal'tsev stated that "since the
previous military doctrine was adopted in 1992, significant changes have taken
place: Belarus' has renounced nuclear weapons, the state organisation has changed

- it has become a presidential republic and the North Atlantic alliance has come
closer to the borders of Belarus'. On top of that, the treaty on the creation of the
Union state of Belarus' and Russia has been signed. All of these changes
demanded the adoption of a new military doctrine."[21] Mal'tsev also stressed that
the military doctrine was based on the Constitution, as well as the new edition of
the country's National Security Concept and "foreign experience". He even managed
to throw in a reference to the terrorist attacks carried out on September 11[th,]
stating that the "terrorist acts in the USA confirmed the correctness of the new
military doctrine of Belarus', the soundness … of the inter-action of the various
power structures in emergency situations".[22] The draft law received its second
reading on 11[th] December 2001, was adopted by the House of Representatives the
following day, approved by the Council of the Republic on 20[th] December 2001 and
signed into law by Lukashenko on 3[rd] January 2002.[23]

The new military doctrine opens with the statement that the doctrine is the sum
total of official views on the military security of the state. "Priority" tasks it
considers to be "the defence of state sovereignty and political independence,
maintaining the territorial integrity and inviolability of the borders of the state".
"Profoundly defensive" in nature, the doctrine states that the Republic of Belarus'
"at the present moment in time" does not recognise any state as being "a potential
aggressor" and views its own military security as being "the state of defensiveness of
its national interests under conditions of a possible transformation of military
danger to military threats to the state."[24]

The doctrine is divided into three sections: "military-political foundations of military
security"; "military-strategic foundations of military security" and "militaryeconomic safeguards for military security". Under the first heading the doctrine
proclaims that Belarus' is in favour "of the creation of a system of European
security, assisting the activisation of international security institutions at the global
and regional level, taking into account the interests of all interested states on the
basis of the principles of trust and mutual understanding". In this particular
context, the doctrine stated that Belarus' sees its role in the Treaty on Collective

Security (signed on 15[th] May 1992) and the Treaty on the Creation of the Union
state (signed on 8[th] December 1999) as being "real steps" in the direction of
creating a viable collective security system in Europe.[25]

In examining the current military-political situation, the doctrine states:

"the military-political situation at the present moment in time is
determined by the following factors:

the lack of effective mechanisms preventing military threats and
defending the interests of all subjects of international relations on the
European continent;
the struggle by the economically-developed states for the markets of raw
materials and attempts by certain trans-national corporations to control
the movement of natural resources for their own interests;
the push by regional centres to secure political leadership in forming
security mechanisms without taking into account the interests of other
subjects of international relations;
the possibility of the spread of nuclear and other weapons of mass
destruction;
the introduction of new weapons technology, the testing of which is
undertaken in local wars and other military conflicts;
aggravation of the information struggle;
strengthening of ethnic and national extremism, activisation of aggressive
separatism."[26]

Immediately following this section is a list of de-stabilising tendencies in the world
at large:

"political-economic blocking of the interests of separate states, attempts
at open interference in internal affairs;
military force of certain states or military blocs, conducted whilst
breaking generally accepted principles and norms of international law;
the use, by certain subjects of international relations, of information
means and technology with aggressive intent, not taking into account the
interests of all the states in Europe in the sphere of security."[27]

This is very much a "European-based" military doctrine: Belarus' has focussed on
analysing and responding to the threats emanating from Europe in general, and
within its own particular locale. Obviously, given its physical size and resources, it
cannot have the same "reach" as, for instance, Russia. Its interpretation of the
recent conflicts, particularly in the Balkans, has caused the country's political and
military leadership to focus on the security situation well within their own physical
and psychological terms of reference. There can be little doubt that much of the text
quoted above had been arrived at through Belarussian military and civilian analysts
examining events in Europe, not globally, particularly the lessons to be learnt from
the break-up of Yugoslavia; the NATO air campaign against FRY in 1999; NATO
expansion in Central and Eastern Europe, etc. Given the geographical proximity of
Belarus' to these events, it should come as no surprise that Belarus' has devoted
time and effort in responding to them along with Russia by, for example, improving
their combined air defence (PVO) capability, plugging the gap, as it were, in the
western region of the CIS collective security system.

The next section lists the official Belarussian view of the main external threats to its
security:

"the presence in certain states of a significant arsenal of nuclear and
other weapons of mass destruction;
existing and future hotbeds of local wars and other armed conflicts;
interference in the internal affairs of the Republic of Belarus';
expansion of military blocs and alliances to the detriment of the military
security of the Republic of Belarus' and opposition to the formation of a
system of collective security involving the Republic of Belarus';
the creation … by certain states (groups of states) of a military offensivestrike potential, leading to a rupture in the existing balance of power;
planned, information (information-psychological) coercion, harmful to the
interests of the Republic of Belarus' and its allies, using modern
information technologies;
discrimination against the rights and lawful interests of citizens of the
Republic of Belarus' in foreign states;
activisation of international terrorism and trans-national crime, growth
in the illegal trade in weapons … narcotics, psychotropic substances …
as well as the illegal migration of people".[28]

In comparison with the list of external threats to Belarussian security, the list of
internal threats is comparatively small:

"the possible appearance and provocative activity of extremist
organisations, aimed at de-stabilising the internal political situation in
the country and the forceful overthrow of the constitutional order;
organised crime, illegal trade and other anti-legal activity on a scale
threatening the security of the state;
the illegal distribution on the territory of the Republic of Belarus' of
weapons, shells, narcotics, psychotropic substances … which could be
used to carry out terrorist acts and other illegal actions".[29]

It would be interesting to see how this list of internal threats to the state has
changed over the past 10 years. Unfortunately, such an examination will only be
possible if the 1992 military doctrine is ever published. Given the way the world
has changed over the past decade, it would be safe to assume that less emphasis
would have been placed in 1992 on the growth in danger to the state from transnational crime, the growing power of extremist organisations, illegal trade in
weapons, etc. It could also be the case that as the state itself has changed - as
Mal'tsev pointed out in his address to parliament during the first reading of the
draft law, the state is now a presidential republic and, thanks to the changes
introduced after the 1996 referendum, the power of parliament has diminished as
the power of the president has increased - so too has this possibly impacted on the
perception of the nature of the internal threat. During his time in office,
Lukashenko has shown himself not averse to using strong arm tactics in order to
silence the opposition: nowhere in the doctrine is the phrase "extremist
organisations" actually defined. Is Lukashenko leaving himself a free hand to define
both the nature of the internal threat and the ways to combat it?

In the next section - "safeguarding military security" - the doctrine details the
country's means of combating the aggressor: "the Republic of Belarus' condemns
war as a means to effect policy and holds to the principle of not being the first to
use the Armed Forces … in solving possible conflicts. The Republic of Belarus' will

consider its potential enemy to be the state whose policy represents a military
threat to the Republic of Belarus', or interferes in its internal affairs, encroaches on
its sovereignty or territorial integrity."[30] NATO - you have been warned!

Should the worst happen, then the Republic will call for assistance, including
military assistance, first and foremost from the other members of the CIS Collective
Security Treaty and those states which have concluded a Treaty of Friendship and
Mutual Assistance with Belarus'.[31] Russia is mentioned for the first time in the
next section, entitled: "maintaining military security", in which it is stated that:
"with the aim of maintaining military security, the Republic of Belarus': … attaches
priority to the formation of a single, defence space with the Russian Federation,
assisting in the development of a joint military infrastructure, adopting other steps
to support the defence capability of the Union State within the framework of the
Treaty on the Creation of the Union State".[32]

This section of the doctrine also mentions that the "Republic of Belarus' … plays an
active part in strengthening the system of collective security within the framework
of the Treaty on Collective Security and increases the effectiveness of the efforts of
other international organisations in safeguarding security in Europe".[33] Further on
in the doctrine, in analysing the military security of the state, great emphasis is
placed on "collective" security, much more so than, for instance, in Russia's military
doctrine. This should not come as any surprise: given the physical size and
resources of Russia, it has greater "reach" than Belarus', more interests to defend
and a much more prominent position in the world. "During peace time," as the
doctrine goes on to say, "the Republic of Belarus' … conducts a peace-loving,
foreign policy course, advances initiatives aimed at the creation of effective systems
of maintaining international security on the European continent, taking into
account the interests of all subjects of international relations".[34] In other words,
Belarus' will work collectively in order to ensure its national security, with Russia,
with the other members of the Treaty on Collective Security, or with other
organisations in Europe. The feeling of "collectivity" runs throughout the new
military doctrine; reliance on the UN, OSCE in the event of military conflict
breaking out, as well as more concrete activity in the operation of joint PVO combat
patrols with Russia, and the joint regional grouping of forces. All this runs against
the idea that Belarus' is some sort of lone "rogue" state in the heart of Europe.
Belarus' has tied its national security arrangements in with those of Russia simply
as a matter of course. Given their shared historical and cultural identities, this is
not surprising and certainly should not be taken to imply that either separately or
collectively the two states are bent on pursuing a course of action designed to destabilise security in the region. It would appear, moreover, that Belarus' is also
ready to enter into a collective security arrangement with the other powers in
Europe. One wonders, therefore, if there is scope for renewed effort to be made to
re-engage Belarus' within the wider European political, economic and security
picture?

During a period of threat or at the beginning of conflict, according to the doctrine,
Belarus' would seek the assistance of the UN, the OSCE and other international
organisations to halt the aggression and restore peace; diplomatic, economic,
information and economic sanctions would be applied, again in a bid to halt the
slide into all-out war; if that failed, the Armed Forces would then be strategically
deployed and the whole state transferred onto a war footing.[35] The nature of the
conflict itself - the doctrine lists the most likely types as "military conflicts", "local
wars" and "regional wars" - would influence the level of force used and assistance
required. Thus:

##### 7


-----

"the Armed Forces, other troops and military units would be used … in a
regional war for the armed defence of the sovereignty and territorial
integrity of the state, with all its corresponding forces and means,
including the use of the combat potential of the regional grouping of
troops (forces) [operating] within the framework of the single, defence
space with the Russian Federation, repelling the attack and defeating the
enemy, forcing him to cease military activities in conditions favourable to
the Republic of Belarus'".[36]

There is a clear inference here that, at least on the scale of a "regional war" defined elsewhere in the doctrine as an "armed clash between states in a specific
region"[37] - an attack on Belarus' would be the equivalent of an attack on the Union
State, ie Belarus' and Russia combined and would involve the joint military units of
the Regional Grouping. That being the case, a regional war in the area involving
either Belarus' or Russia would appear to be an unlikely development in the future:
attacking an isolated Belarus' would be a possibility, but not Belarus' combined
with Russia, in the practical form of the joint Regional Grouping of Troops. In this
respect, Belarus' derives a very real practical benefit from the military cooperation it
enjoys with Russia: increased security in a geopolitically fluid part of Europe.
Russia gets to plug part of its gap in the western defence region, thanks to Belarus'
being part of Russia's defensive screen in the west. Defence of the Union State is
mentioned a few more times in the remaining sections of the doctrine. For instance
in terms of anti-aircraft defence, the doctrine states that: "the tasks of the armed
forces in peace time include: … improving anti-aircraft defence as a unified, combat

[capable] defensive system of the Union state".[38]

Slightly further on, there is a specific reference to the mechanism involved in the
deployment of the Regional Grouping: "for the armed defence of the Union State, in
repelling foreign aggression, a regional grouping of troops (forces) is being created,
the use of which will be carried out on the basis of a plan in accordance with a
decision of the Supreme State Council of the Union state".[39]

The Supreme State Council is the highest organ of the Union State and was created
in accordance with the Treaty for the Creation of a Union State signed in December
1999. The Council is made up of "the heads of state, the heads of government and
the leaders of the chambers of parliament of the member-states" and "decides the
most important questions in relation to the development of the Union State; within
the limits of its competence, forms the organs of the Union State, including
administrative organs of a regional and functional nature; appoints elections to the
Chamber of Representatives of the Union parliament; approves the budget of the
Union parliament … approves international treaties of the Union parliament,
ratified by the parliament".[40] Towards the end of the second section of the doctrine,
entitled "military-strategic foundations of military security", once again mention is
made of the role of the Supreme State Council:

"to control the regional grouping of troops (forces) … by decision of the
Supreme State Council of the Union State on the basis of the Ministry of
Defence of the Republic of Belarus' (General Staff of the Armed Forces),
during the period of threat, a collegiate organ of military command will be
created - the unified command of the regional grouping of troops (forces)
… Organising the maintenance of the military security of the Republic of
Belarus' and the Union State during the period of threat, the creation of
the organs of military command will be in accordance with the legislative

process of the Republic of Belarus' and the legal acts of the Union
State."[41]

The third and final section of the doctrine is entitled "the basis of the economic
maintenance of military security" and focusses on ensuring that the state is able to
plan for and survive an attack on the country through adequate advance
preparation of its economic infrastructure, including maintaining strategic reserves
of food, fuel and munitions, civil defence measures; ability to mobilise the economy
quickly for war production, etc.[42]

#### The Union Military Doctrine

The Belorussian military doctrine outlines both the potential use of the regional
grouping of troops, as well as the structures involved in their deployment,
command and control - at all stages, since they are a force belonging to the Union
State, it's the Union State which decides how the force is to be deployed. For that
reason, at this juncture it is appropriate to examine what is currently known about
the Union military doctrine.

In December 2000, an interview of the current Commander of Ground Forces of the
Republic of Belarus', Major-General Yu Portnov, stated that "work is drawing to a
close on the single military doctrine for the Union State".[43] A brief interview then
appeared, circulated by _Agenstvo Voyennykh Novostey in January 2001, of the_
chairman of the commission for national security, member of the parliamentary
assembly of the Union State of Russia and Belarus', B Bikkinin, in which he stated
that the doctrine would be approved "by the middle of 2001". He stated that the
draft version of the doctrine contained "a system of views on the military policy of
the Union State [taking into account] the changing conditions of today's world". He
also emphasised that, even after the adoption of the new Union military doctrine,
Belarus' would still not be in a position where it would have to "send its soldiers in
joint operations in hot spots". It would, however, fulfil its obligations both in terms
of regional security "in the western direction" and with respect to the Treaty on
Collective Security.[44] A couple of months after Bikkinin's interview, another brief
report appeared in the well-respected Russian military newspaper, _Nezavisimoye_
_Voyennoye Obozreniye, paraphrasing recent remarks by the then Belarussian_
Minister of Defence, Colonel-General A Chumakov, that both Russia and Belarus'
were still involved in "working-out a common military doctrine" for the two
countries.[45] According to Russian Defence Minister S Ivanov after his visit to
Belarus', the "first item on the agenda" was the "military doctrine of the Union
State". In a specific reference to the doctrine, Ivanov stated that it would be
"completely open, transparent and published in the media. This will occur after it
has been examined and approved by the Council of the heads of state."[46]

There appears to have been no further public mention of the doctrine until the end
of December 2001, when a report by the _BelaPAN news agency stated that at a_
session of the Supreme State Council, both the Union State's military doctrine and
"a plan of work for improving the United regional grouping of troops" had been
formally approved.[47] A report issued the following day confirmed that both
Presidents Lukashenko and Putin had signed the doctrine into law. Belarussian
Minister of Defence Mal'tsev stated that both the military doctrine and the plan
were aimed at "maintaining the security of the Union state and were worked out
taking into account both the military doctrines and the national security concepts
of both countries".[48] Mal'tsev also stated that the Union military doctrine

"evaluated the military threats to the Union State, a plan for neutralising them

[and] principles of military organisation of the Union State".[49] Unfortunately, to
date (April 2002) no published version of the new Union military doctrine has come
to light.

#### Conclusion

Although it is not as yet possible to make a line by line comparison of the 1992 and
2002 military doctrines, judging by what has been published of the 1992 doctrine,
it would appear that a number of important changes have been introduced ten
years on. This is hardly surprising, given how the political situation has changed
within and outwith Belarus'. In 1992, Belarus' under Shushkevich had just begun
on the path of independence and was still very much feeling its way ahead: its
decisions to become a non-nuclear power - despite the nuclear legacy left to
Belarus' following the collapse of the USSR in 1991 - and a neutral state were clear
evidence of the early republic's desire to throw off its Soviet past and emerge as a
"non-threat" to its neighbours. It was in many ways (like many of the other
republics of the fSU) a new state in a new international environment, attempting to
re-establish its identity, not wishing to cause fear or distrust amongst its
neighbours. Judging from the analysis of the 1992 doctrine, these laudable aims
were carried forth in the doctrine - in the ideas of "containment" and "active
defence", emphasising the transitional nature of this period in the history of the
republic, moving away from a military strategy based on nuclear weapons to a
strategy of cooperation with other states in order to ensure its security.

Ten years later, the nuclear missiles have gone, as has the idea of "active defence";
and cooperation with other states in the military-political sphere has tended to
focus almost exclusively on developing a relationship first and foremost with the
Russian Federation and secondly with the member-countries of the Treaty on
Collective Security. In short, Belarus' is now heavily tied into two main military
unions. Whilst both military tie-ins reflect a response to the local situation, as
perceived by the military and political elite in Minsk, nevertheless this developing
bond has also been in part response to the expansion of NATO. Back in 1992,
NATO expansion in this part of the world was not really considered by anyone in
particularly serious terms, therefore the 1992 doctrine would not have needed to
take this particular factor into account. 10 years later, however, it has already
happened and, come November 2002, more of Belarus' neighbours could be added
to Poland, as members of NATO. Again, the changing security situation
surrounding the country compelled the doctrine to be re-written. If NATO had not
expanded would the doctrine still have needed to be re-written? Would Belarus'
have dropped its neutral status?

Whilst there may still lack a "common defence space" over the fSU - partly due to
the US military presence in Central Asia - Moscow and Minsk can take heart from
the way that the gap in their western defences has been plugged comparatively
easily. With shared PVO patrols and the Russians operating their early warning
missile site at Gantsevichi and the submarine communications centre at Vileyka,
the military have managed to ensure that the western regional defence system has
been significantly strengthened. The creation of the Unified Regional Grouping of
Troops has also helped to secure a potential gaping hole in both countries' defence
grid. Belarus' is strategically very important to Russia, but Russia is also very
important to Belarus'.  Trade between the two countries has helped to cement the
relationship further and yet neither of the two states has yet taken the ultimate

plunge into full unification. Belarus' has pushed the harder of the two. Militarily,
neither state has openly spoken about the creation of a united armed force: the
creation of the unified PVO system is, arguably, the closest they've come: the
Unified Regional Grouping of Troops is not a proper military force _per se,_ existing
for the time being only on paper and only planned to become operational should a
military threat arise in the region.[50] True, if brought into action, it will operate
under a single command and will pull together both Russia's forces in the West and
the entire Belarussian Armed Forces, but that is a possibility that, given no threat,
will never materialise.

In general terms, the current military doctrine of Belarus' has been written taking
into account the changed circumstances of the state. As C-in-C of the Armed
Forces, the president is now in overall charge of the country's military security - the
list of "internal threats" does give Lukashenko greater authority to deal with
"extremist organisations" as he sees fit. Lukashenko has shown in the run-up to
last year's presidential election race that any real challenge to his political authority
will not be tolerated (various intimidation tactics were used to "discourage" the
country's political opposition) but, internal political opposition aside, the doctrine is
not an "aggressive" one, there is a strong emphasis throughout the doctrine on the
principle of "collectivity". Through its relationship with Russia, and with the
member states of the Treaty on Collective Security, Belarus' sees itself and its
security as being tied in with the security of other states. It may have abandoned
the earlier declared notion of "neutrality", but it has taken on board the idea of
"collective security" instead and therefore should not be treated as a state
conducting its affairs in "splendid isolation", never mind "rogue" fashion. Its
geographical, political, economic and intellectual position militate against the
country embarking on the isolationist road for long. Belarus' has usually been part
of something bigger, the Russian Empire or the USSR in the 19[th] and 20[th] centuries.
In the last century, Belarus' enjoyed very little time as an independent state and
this is probably one of the reasons why the state seems to be not all that keen on
retaining its independence and more keen on re-integration with its larger
neighbour, the Russian Federation. Military cooperation with Russia is part of a
wider cultural, economic and political process and simply reflects the fact that
Russia has been the single biggest influence on Belarus' for centuries. The new
military doctrine not only reflects the changes over the past ten years, both
internally and externally, but also reinforces an age-old relationship with Russia
and carries on a tradition which pre-dates 2002, 1992 and even 1917. Belarus', as
detailed through its doctrine, is not a geopolitical "black hole" in the centre of
Europe and should not be treated as such.

see this regional group, I answer: you will see it when there is a real military threat to the
Union of Byelorussia and Russia" (Major-General Yu Portnov, "Po yedinym zakonam",
