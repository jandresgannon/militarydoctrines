### MINISTER’S ADDRESS

_Andreja Katič, Minister of Defence_

Ladies and Gentlemen,

In May 2015, I was entrusted with the position of Minister of Defence of the Republic of
Slovenia. I accepted this position with an awareness of the great responsibility and importance
of the defence field, and immediately joined my co-workers in addressing the current issues.

The second half of 2015 was mostly marked by our participation in the resolution of the refugee
and migrant crisis. I can say with the utmost certainty that the Administration of the Republic of
Slovenia for Civil Protection and Disaster Relief and the Slovenian Armed Forces, together with
the Slovenian Police, did everything in their power and in the power of other participating
humanitarian organizations to provide as decent care as possible to the refugees and migrants
during their transition of our state's territory.

Security cannot be taken for granted; it is something that we must work towards. To ensure an
appropriate state of readiness, security systems must be well maintained. The Slovenian Armed
Forces and the system of protection against natural and other disasters enjoy great public
confidence. Consequently, citizens expect they operate effectively.

The MoD's contribution to the resolution of the crisis and the stabilization of public finances in
recent years was by far the most significant in comparison to other ministries. This is also one of
the reasons why nowadays we are confronted by great challenges regarding the further
development and equipment of the Slovenian Armed Forces and the defence system as a
whole. We have confronted these challenges with great zeal and energy and in a very proactive
way. We are currently carrying out a strategic overview of the defence field, updating normative
strategic documents, among which I would like to mention the new Defence Act and the

5/115


-----

amendments to the Service in the Slovenian Armed Forces Act, and we are also implementing
a number of other measures. But above all other things, it is essential that we ensure a
continuous and a stable source of financing of the Slovenian Armed Forces. Should this
condition be fulfilled, we will once again be able to direct the Slovenian Armed Forces' path in a
positive direction. In order to be adequately prepared to defend the homeland and support the
system of protection against natural and other disasters, the units of the Slovenian Armed
Forces should be well manned, equipped and trained. In this way, we will be able to further
provide our contribution to common defence in line with our international commitments.

In addition to the great involvement of almost the entire protection, rescue and relief system in
the management of the refugee and migrant situation, another important step was made in this
area: important processes are being carried out both in the normative and organizational fields,
which will consequently contribute to the even better functioning and responsiveness of the
system.

We have set very ambitious goals for ourselves for 2016. I am well aware that much still has to
be done to achieve the greatest possible harmonization of the planned changes. I also believe
that we will be able to reach these goals. To conclude, I would like to state that I am proud of all
the employees of the defence system and of their contribution to our common operations.

Andreja Katič,

Minister of Defence

### 2 SAF MILITARY TRAINING AND EXERCISES

SAF commands and units have been trained and are qualified according to the Mission
Essential Task List (METL) and the adopted standards for operation and the attainment of
operational capabilities in 2015. The qualification of SAF commands and units under the METL
differs in relation to the situation in units in different operational cycles.

**2.1 Overview of Important Training Courses for SAF Members and Units**

SAF commands and units are trained for the implementation of tasks in accordance with their
missions. In 2015, training was oriented towards the accomplishment of missions in
International Operations and Missions (IOM), and the attainment of the planned operational
capabilities of SAF commands and units.

In the process of military training we have confronted and still are confronting challenges
resulting from the reduction of financial resources. This is also one of the main reasons for the
reduction in the number of members of SAF commands and units attending individual training
and exercises at home and abroad. All SAF commands and units intended for operations at
home and abroad have met the required marksmanship standards.

The main emphases in the military training process:

  - Implementation of training for IOM (ISAF, KFOR, UNIFIL, Bosnia and Herzegovina,
NLO Skopje, UNTSO, Belgrade, Mali).

  - Seventy percent of all planned international military exercises have been conducted in
accordance with the defence system plan.

  - Execution of the SAF main military exercise, the Immediate Response 15.

  - Execution of the Adriatic Strike 15 exercise.

  - Joint training of SAF commands and units together with the 173rd IBCT of the United
States Armed Forces.

  - Execution of the Immediate Reaction Forces Training (IRF – Brilliant Jump Alertex and
Trident Juncture).

At the Immediate Response 15 exercise the SAF, for the first time ever, established a cyber
attack cell which has proven to be extremely important. The SAF also participated in the Cyber
Coalition 15 exercise, in which cyber defence was addressed as one of NATO's strategic
requirements.

**2.2 Training of Aviation Units**

The training objectives were primarily oriented towards the individual training of members and
the collective training of the 15th Wing units.

Individual training for the 15th Wing members was focused on:

  - Implementation of individual military skills training.

  - Execution of the test on the handling of weapons.

  - Execution of firing with infantry armaments.

  - Achieving the required training level of specialist skills, with the intent of maintaining the
appropriate level of training for the licensed personnel.

The following activities, carried out by the 15th Wing units, should be pointed out in the area of
collective trainings and exercises:

  - Organization and implementation of the multinational military exercise Adriatic Strike
15, which was carried out for the purposes of upgrading multinational cooperation with
neighbouring countries in the field of JTAC and CAS crew training. During the exercise,

8/115

verification and confirmation of the operational capabilities of the 15th Wing's command
units was carried out. Members of twelve different countries participated in the exercise.

  - Gradual verification of helicopter capabilities for the purposes of Medical Evacuation
(MEDEVAC) based on the NATO TACEVAL (Capability Inspection) system, which was
carried out by the Ramstein Air Command (AIRCOM) verification team in the area of
Cerklje ob Krki Airfield in September.

  - Participation in the Trident Juncture 15 NATO exercise with a MEDEVAC helicopter,
which was held in Sardinia in Italy in October and November 2015.

  - Participation in the main helicopter exercise in Europe in 2015 – the Italian Blade 15
exercise on the 15th of July 2015 in the area of Viterbo Air Force Base in Italy.

  - Participation in the Ample Strike exercise with the Pilatus PC-9 aircraft and JTACs in
the Czech Republic in September 2015.

  - Participation of the 16th Air Space Surveillance and Control Centre in an electronic
warfare exercise with Pilatus PC-9 aircraft in Ramstein Guard on the 4th of June 2015.

  - Execution of two JTAC courses based on STANAG 3797 and other organizational
preparations for the establishment and certification of AGOS School in the context of
the establishment of the JTAC school capabilities.

  - Provision of aviation support to other SAF-led training and exercises (Airweeki,
Immediate Response 15, Rock Proof 15).

**2.3 Important Training Courses of the Naval Unit**

Important training and exercises conducted by the 430th Naval Division in 2015:

  - Training of individuals, crews, sections, platoons, the detachment and the division.

  - Execution of training for naval interception procedures, nuclear, radiological, chemical
and biological defence (CBRN) procedures and Air Defence procedures, as well as
other training for the maintenance of the attained level and the provision of readiness
and responsiveness for operations at home and abroad.

  - Functional training of SAF ship crews for operations in all sea conditions.

  - Training based on protection and rescue plans, immediate response forces and the
implementation of force protection in ports and anchorages (ship security).

  - Training on the maintenance of vessels.

  - Verification of the maintenance of operational capabilities at the Octopus 15 exercise.

  - Training of the Unit on the Detection of Unexploded Ordnance sections in UXO
detection, the disposal and destruction of conventional munitions, and on the
introduction to and familiarization with the new specialist equipment.

  - Training of individuals in the detection of improvised explosive devices (IED).

**2.4 Training of the Contract Reserve Component**

A call-up and training of the Military Medical Unit contract reserve members was carried out. An
additional 301 contract reserve members were called out and trained for the purposes of the
Migrant operation. The tasks in the Migrant operation were carried out by 121 members of the
contract reserve component.

**2.5 Student Camp**

Professional practice or compulsory training in the SAF was, in accordance with the scholarship
contract, completed by five MoD scholarship holders, three active component members and,
based on a special authorization granted by the Minister, by an additional four students from the
Faculty of Maritime Studies and Transport (the 430th Naval Division).

The military camp was attended by 61 students, including four MoD scholarship holders and
one high-school student over the age of 18 years. The compulsory professional practice at the
camp was successfully completed by 17 students of the Faculty of Criminal Justice and
Security, and one high-school student. The MoD and the Youth Camp was attended by 52
secondary school students.

_Military Camp                    The MoD and the Youth Camp_

Military Camp 2015 was organized at the SAF Officer Candidate School between the 6th and
the 18th of July. Students and high-school students were welcomed at the Kadetnica in Maribor
where they received their uniforms and were informed of the basic military and drill regulations.
The two-week camp was carried out at the Boštjan Kekec Barracks in Bohinjska Bela.

In the first week, the camp participants learned about armaments, drill regulations and the
basics of tactics. During this week, adrenalin rushes and motivation were ensured by topics
which included water obstacles, climbing at the Iglica climbing area, and shooting with a smallcaliber and an automatic rifle. Sunday was more relaxed, as it consisted of presentations of the
SAF Chaplaincy, different SAF units and armaments, together with some sports and games.

The second week of the camp started with an alarm drill. After the units gathered, they moved
to the SAF Central Firing Range and Training Area in Postojna, where the field part of the
training took place. During field training, the camp participants learned about different topics in
tactics. "Monitoring" was undoubtedly one of the most interesting topics, as the students and
high-school students spent the night at the observation post (OP) outside the camp. At the end
of the training, they demonstrated their acquired knowledge at an exercise attended by

representatives of the Military Schools Centre, representatives of the Faculty of Social
Sciences, and representatives of the Faculty of Criminal Justice and Security.

### 3 DEVELOPMENT AND BUILDING OF SAF CAPABILITIES

In accordance with the Resolution on General Long-Term Development and Equipping
Programme of the Slovenian Armed Forces up to 2025 (ReDPROSV25) from 2010 and the
NATO Defence Planning Process, the Medium-Term Defence Programme of the RS for the
period 2013-2018 (SOPR 2013-2018) was prepared and endorsed by the Government. The
Medium-Term Defence Programme is a planning document which defines the objectives and
key guidelines for the development and operation of the defence system of the Republic of
Slovenia (RS) in the medium-term period 2013-2018.

This medium-term document defines the target organizational structure of the SAF in 2018, and
the development of priority capabilities and their equipping with new weapons and military
equipment. Projected defence spending was prepared, including a planned reduction in
expenditure on staff and a gradual increase in the proportion of operational (operational
functioning and maintenance) and investment costs (acquisition and construction), which were
expected to increase in 2015. The SAF's basic objective in the field of human resources is to
maintain its strength, within the limits of 7,600 members of the active component and up to
1,500 members of the contract reserve component.

In addition to the Resolution on General Long-Term Development and Equipping Programme of
the Slovenian Armed Forces up to 2025, the Medium-Term Defence Programme of the RS for
the period 2013-2018 is also in line with the agreed capability targets. With these targets,
Slovenia assumed, on the basis of the principle of fair burden-sharing, NATO's Strategic
Concept and the political guidelines, specific obligations in the development of certain
capabilities and in the contribution of the RS to collective security. Slovenia aims primarily to
maintain the achieved level and eliminate shortcomings in the quality of already developed
capabilities (the Motorized Battalion Battle Group, the CBRN Defence Battalion) and to form a
Medium Battalion Battle Group, which will, through the procurement of additional equipment in
the next medium-term planning period, develop into a Mechanized Battalion Battle Group
capable of operating in all potential Alliance operations. The trend of several years of cuts in the
defence budget, and thus the funds for the operation and development of the SAF has already
had a significant impact on the SAF’s capabilities and reduced the capability of Slovenia in the
field of defence. With this constant reduction in the SAF’s financial resources from 2010 to
2015, and given the resources planned in the Medium-Term Defence Programme of the RS for
the period 2013-2018 and a slow, gradual increase in the SAF’s financial resources in the
period 2016-2020, it is clear that Slovenia will not achieve the development of SAF capabilities
and commitments to the Alliance planned in the Medium-Term Defence Programme of the RS
for the period 2013-2018, or the ambitious forecast of development stated in the Resolution on
General Long-Term Development and Equipping Programme of the SAF up to 2025.

The reduction of resources has adversely affected the functioning of the Slovenian Armed
Forces and the provision of its core capabilities. Consequently, this has brought about an
increase in national defence risks in ensuring the planned RS defence system capabilities,
interoperability difficulties due to the technological lag, a decrease in the RS's ability for
operations both at home and abroad, and a reduction in the credibility of the RS within the
Alliance. Such risks cannot be entirely avoided, since the cumulative consequences of several
years' of decline in resources are increasingly obvious. Due to the changed security situation,
we can expect additional requirements of the Alliance, such as the provision of the most
important capabilities in advance and the increased responsiveness of the current capabilities
which, under present circumstances, would be practically impossible.

In the event of a substantial deterioration in the international security situation, the Doctrine of
the Military Strategic Reserve of the RS enables the supplementation and increase in SAF
capabilities for the purposes of providing military defence.

### 4 MAINTAINING A LEVEL OF READINESS

In 2015, the Slovenian Armed Forces (SAF) ensured its readiness in a challenging economic
and financial situation which, for the fifth consecutive year, was reflected in reduced financial
resources and personnel for the SAF.

Economy measures, which were implemented primarily in the areas of modernization, the
maintenance of infrastructure and vehicle fleets, and the provision of working conditions,
accommodation and personal equipment of the SAF members, had a significant negative
impact on ensuring the required level of readiness.

The process of modernization was almost entirely stopped, thus continuing the downward trend
of aging and wear of weapons and equipment, the aging of the armed forces and the
deterioration of the structural relationships between officers, NCOs and soldiers. The reduction
in financial resources and economy measures prevented the planned provision and
maintenance of capabilities, as well as training in accordance with current professional military
standards. In the long-term, further reduction of financial resources would greatly compromise
the provision of the required and necessary readiness of the SAF.

In 2015, the SAF still maintained the required level of readiness and was able to perform most
peacetime tasks at home and abroad, though with an increased risk in relation to the previous
years (modernisation standstill, aging of weapons and equipment, less training). However, it
was not able to perform the full range of tasks in a crisis, imminent threat of war or war. The
reasons for this were the insufficient level of manpower, weapons and military equipment of
commands and units, and the increasing wear and obsolescence of weapons and military
equipment.

The SAF provided part of the necessary capabilities for its operations in the framework of the
Alliance and maintained its contribution in IOM and in reaction forces in accordance with its
commitments.

It supported the system of protection against natural and other disasters and was willing to
assist other state bodies and organizations in ensuring the safety and welfare of the citizens of
the RS. Since October 2015, the SAF have been providing substantial relief forces and
resources as well as logistic support to Civil Protection (CP) for the purposes of migrant care. At
the same time, it provides support to the Police in its protection of the national border. In this
context the SAF provided permanent participation of a relatively large number of its service
members assigned to different tasks. The number of members, however, changed on a daily
basis; on average 45 members provided support to Civil Protection and 470 to the Police. In
that same period, on average 42 SAF vehicles were included in the activities, 13 helicopter
flights were carried out and the SAF prepared and distributed over 150,000 meals each day. It
put in place 143,470 metres of temporary technical obstacles. Additionally, the SAF carried out
procedures for the call-up of contract reserve members, including their equipping and training.

### 5 KEY PROJECTS OF THE SAF MODERNIZATION

The equipping of the SAF was conducted in accordance with the equipping plans and the
available financial resources.

A number of important projects were carried out:

  - Purchase of 1,108 combat helmets.

  - Purchase of 1,100 sets of new battle dress uniform.

  - Purchase of military boots.

  - Purchase of one emergency ambulance.

  - Purchase of 76 personal and multi-purpose vehicles.

  - Purchase of 679 active earmuffs for the protection of hearing.

  - Purchase of 20 automated external defibrillators (AED) and two school AEDs.

  - Purchase of an integrated chemistry analyzer for the occupational medicine laboratory.

  - Purchase of equipment kits for the Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Unit.

  - Purchase of equipment for the JTAC unit (TACP).

  - The planned quantities of ammunition, explosive and training resources were acquired
for the preservation of stocks and for training purposes.

  - The fourth and last Cougar transport helicopter was upgraded.

The SAF introduced and issued orders on the introduction into operational use of the following
important capabilities and resources:

  - Protective Tactical Vest A-02,

  - Man-portable air defence system IGLA-S,

  - Soldier Parachute Aerial Reconnaissance Camera System Sparcs 40mm,

  - Methodology for identifying leadership potential,

  - Night vision monocular device AP/PVS-14,

  - ZK-1A and ZK-1B medical kits,

  - The main firefighting rescue vehicle, Saval Kronenburg,

  - A man-portable short range radar system.

In the framework of the US military assistance programmes, five M1151 HMMWV vehicles and
spare parts for 4x4 HMMWV and 6x6 MRAP vehicles, as well as computer servers for the
Operations Centre and engineer equipment for the Special Operations Unit, were supplied.

The SAF introduced a number of capabilities into operational use; systems for the operation of
the Cerklje ob Krki Airport (illumination, navigation, radio navigation, meteorological and
information systems), the RGW90 mobile training system, an emergency ambulance, a 6x6
MRAP vehicle for the Explosive Ordnance Disposal Unit, an infantry obstacle course, active
earmuffs and AN/PRC-117G Multiband Manpack Radios. A FATS firearms training simulator in
Kranj is also being introduced.

Due to the significant reduction in funding in recent years, tactical military communication and
information systems (CIS) could not be modernized; however, we signed a contract for the
purchase of Command and Control 2 CIS Capabilities in 2015, so these results will be visible in
future years. We replaced the central disk system and established a modernized information
system in the Joint Operations Centre at Force Command.

For other important projects whose implementation is planned in the future, coordinated with the
Medium-Term Defence Programme of the RS for the period 2013-2018 (i.e. 60mm mortars,
equipment for the general engineer company, a 4x4 Light Wheeled Armoured Vehicle, handheld anti-armour weapons for multiple use), special investment documentation was prepared for
the launching of purchase projects in 2016 and 2017.

### 6 SAF OPERATIONS IN SUPPORT OF THE SYSTEM OF PROTECTION AGAINST NATURAL AND OTHER DISASTERS

The SAF actively supported the operation of the system of protection against natural and other
disasters, and participated in it in all its capacity, with emphasis on helicopter rescue in the
mountains, helicopter emergency medical aid and the setting up of launch bridges. The SAF
utilizes its capabilities based on its level of readiness and the extent of different disasters, and
provides a concept for the gradual augmentation of protection, rescue and relief capabilities
through the formation of specialist capacities and capabilities intended as workforce, in
compliance with the Vihra 13 Plan and the requirements of the Civil Protection Commander. In
addition, the SAF has, in compliance with the Resolution of the Government of the RS, also
participated in the provision of logistic support to state bodies during migrant care.

**6.1 Helicopter Rescue and Assistance**

In the military area of Jože Pučnik Ljubljana Airport, one SAF helicopter is on 15-minute standby
every day for mountain rescue during the daytime. In addition to rescues in the mountains and
in hard-to-access areas, the duty crew also performs emergency helicopter transport within the
framework of helicopter emergency medical assistance. The table below shows detailed
information on helicopter rescue and assistance.

The duty crew of the 151st Rotary Wing Squadron carried out 229 rescue operations, of which
132 were mountain rescue operations and 94 were operations for the provision of emergency
medical helicopter assistance, as well as contributing to the extinguishing of a forest fire on
Peca. The crew transported 254 injured or sick people, 520 emergency responders, and 29 tons
of first aid equipment, in a total of 279 flying hours.

Since the signing of the agreement on cooperation between the MoD and the Institute of the RS
for the Transplantation of Organs and Tissues, Slovenija Transplant, in March 2015, the duty
crews of the 152nd Fixed Wing Squadron carried out seven transportations of vital organs and
medicines with the Falcon aircraft in the Republic of Slovenia.

**6.2 Forms of Assistance and Operation of the SAF in the System of Protection against**
**Natural and Other Disasters**

After 16th September, the SAF provided logistic support to Civil Protection for assignments to
give support to national bodies during migrant care. Included in the logistic support were as
many as 4,664 SAF members who, in accordance with the demonstrated needs, arranged
accommodation centres, prepared and distributed hot meals and drinks, prepared cargo,
disinfected the premises and carried out pest control services and different transport
assignments. The vehicles were driven total of 131,507km. Military cooking teams prepared and
distributed over 150,000 hot meals.

Based on the Civil Protection Commander's request, the SAF set up launch bridges in different
areas across Slovenia.

In February of 2015, the SAF, with the intent of becoming even more involved in the system of
protection against natural and other disasters, presented and tested the concept of rapid
augmentation of SAF capabilities for participation in protection, rescue and relief activities in the
Vihra 15 exercise, and prepared directives for participation in protection, rescue and relief
activities.

### 7 SAF CONTRIBUTION TO INTERNATIONAL PEACE, SECURITY AND STABILITY 

In 2015, Slovenia continued its participation in international Operations and Missions (IOM),
taking into account the fundamental national interests, available resources and capabilities,
adopted international commitments and the increasingly unpredictable dynamics of IOM. SAF
participation in IOM was conducted on the basis of Government resolutions, directions and
other field documents of the Ministry of Defence (MoD), Operations Plans (OPLAN) and SAF
command and control documents. In terms of Slovenia's participation in IOM, the priority area of
operations remains the Western Balkans (KFOR, EUFOR Althea, NATO integration and
counselling structures), and participation in the newly established NATO counselling mission in
Afghanistan (RSM), the new EU operation in the southern part of the Mediterranean Sea
(EUNAVFOR MED in Sophia), in the EU mission in Sahel in Africa (EUTM MALI) and in UN
missions in the Middle East (UNIFIL, UNTSO). The MoD also deployed a civilian observer to the
OSCE Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine. When planning the participation of SAF forces
and preparing and deploying SAF contingents in IOM, great emphasis is attached to lessons
learned, which contributes to the preparation and operation of the Slovenian contingents in IOM.

**7.1. NATO Operations**

_KFOR (Kosovo)_

In accordance with the fundamental strategic interests of the RS pertaining to areas such as
foreign affairs and security, among others, the majority of the SAF members participating in IOM
in 2015 performed their duties in the Western Balkans. There, the focus was on the operation of
the Allied KFOR Forces in Kosovo, in which an average of 308 SAF members and four civilian
functional experts took part. Under the KFOR mandate, Slovenian members' activities were
aimed at maintaining a secure and stable environment and freedom of movement; protecting
KFOR facilities and facilities of special importance; reconnaissance and monitoring the security
and general conditions in the area of operations; providing helicopter transport, rapid response
forces and tactical reserves; and carrying out staff duties. Members of the Slovenian contingent

17/115


-----

provided support to the development of Kosovo security forces and the Ministry for the Kosovo
Security Forces through both NATO groups for integration and counselling. The contingent
operated mostly in the area of central Kosovo, although part of the operational activities of the
SAF units was carried out in the north of the country. At the international level, the MoD
continuously defended Slovenia's position that it is necessary to prudently and gradually
address the issues of the further reduction of the extent and the changes in the posture of the
KFOR forces, taking into account the security situation on the ground and all other relevant
factors and conditions.

_RSM (Afghanistan)_

The ISAF operation ended, and, from 1st of January 2015, the RS has been participating in a
new NATO counselling mission, the Resolute Support Mission in Afghanistan. Two contingents,
each consisting of seven members, were deployed to the mission. The focus of the SAF
members' operation was on the mentoring and training of the Afghanistan National Defence and
Security Forces (ANDSF) in the composition of the advisory team of the 207th Corps, and on an
operation within the regional command for counselling and training, the Regional Command
West. In this way, the SAF contributed to the provision of the ANDSF's sustainability and the
enhancement of its capabilities, and consequently to the strengthening of the Afghan
Government for the independent and substantial provision of security and stability in the
country.

_NATO Response Force (NRF)_

SAF's participation in the NRF in the next five years (2013-2018) is defined in the resolution of
the Government of the RS, adopted in May 2013. On this basis, the MoD or the SAF plans to
cooperate, within the framework of the NRF, with those units which provide the highest added
value to the process of the SAF's transformation, and in those niche areas which are of greatest
importance for ensuring the SAF's preparedness and future development. In addition, the SAF
also participates in the implementation of the Readiness Action Plan (RAP), adopted at the
NATO Wales Summit in September 2014. In 2015, the RS, as part of the temporary NATO
Rapid Reaction Force, participated in the NATO Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe
(SHAPE) with one Military Police Company and two officers.

_NATO's Peacetime Operation Air Policing in Slovenian Airspace_

The signing and ratification of the amended bilateral agreement between the governments of
Slovenia and Hungary from 2014, on military cooperation in the fields of aviation and air
defence from 1996, enabled the inclusion of Hungary (beside Italy) in the above-mentioned
NATO operation. In addition to long-range radars for air policing, Slovenia also contributes two
helicopters for search and rescue (SAR).

_NATO HQ in Sarajevo and NATO Liaison Offices in Belgrade and Skopje_

Seven SAF members are active in the NATO HQ Sarajevo, while one member works in the
NATO Military Liaison Office (MLO) in Belgrade and one in Skopje. Their mission is the
performance of tasks that are important in terms of carrying out defence and military reforms
and partnership programmes in host countries, and in terms of their progress towards EuroAtlantic structures.

**7.2 UN Operations and Missions**

_UNIFIL, UNTSO (Middle East)_

The Middle East is one of the priority areas of cooperation of Slovenia in IOM. Therefore, the
MoD endeavoured to maintain an appropriate level of contribution of the SAF to the UN
missions UNIFIL (14 members) and UNTSO (3 members), which support the maintenance of
peace in the region. Due to the deterioration of the security situation at the Golan Heights in
Syria, the UNTSO withdrew all its observers from the Damascus observer group, which was

18/115


-----

perfectly in line with Slovenia's geographic limitations regarding the operation of SAF members
in the UNTSO mission in the year 2014. For this reason the formal preservation of national
restrictions and reservations was no longer reasonable or necessary, so, in October 2015, the
Government of the RS adopted a decision to abolish national restrictions on the participation of
SAF members in the UNTSO operation.

**7.3 EU Operations**

_EUTM Mali (Mali)_

Within the framework of the EU’s activities in Africa, the SAF participated at the training mission
for Malian armed forces (EUTM Mali) with the presence of three SAF members, and thus
contributed to the establishment of Malian defence capabilities. Thus, the SAF indirectly
contributed to the stabilization of the security situation in the country and also in the wider Sahel
region, and at the same time demonstrated a responsible attitude and awareness of the
importance of responding to security challenges deriving from the African continent.

At the end of November 2015, following terrorist attacks in Paris and on France's request under
Article 42.7 of the Treaty on the European Union, the Government of the RS adopted a decision
to increase the SAF's participation in this mission to up to ten members.

_EUFOR ALTHEA (Bosnia and Herzegovina)_

The SAF continued its participation in the EUFOR ALTHEA Operation with nine members and
one deployable team for training and mentoring the BiH armed forces, which is deployed to the
area of operations for short periods of time and for the execution of a specific task. Slovenia
thus continued its military contribution to the strengthening of peace and security in BiH, and to
the joint efforts for the establishment of properly trained, professional and efficient armed forces
of that country. The activities of the Slovenian contingent were primarily focused on the
performance of staff and logistics support tasks, and on the gathering of information regarding
the situation on the ground, and the training and mentoring of members of the engineer
battalion of the BiH armed forces.

_EUNAVFOR MED/Sophia (southern part of the central Mediterranean Sea)_

In July 2015, SAF became actively involved in the EUNAVFOR MED maritime operation
Sophia, the main mission of which is to carry out systematic activities for the identification,
seizure or confiscation and removal of vessels and other assets used by or suspected of being
used by smugglers or human traffickers, thus contributing to the wider efforts of the EU in
disrupting the trafficking model and trade networks in the southern part of the central
Mediterranean Sea.

SAF deployed the first contingent in three phases. The first phase included the deployment of
three members into the operation's Operational Command in Rome, while the second phase
included the deployment of four members to the Force Command and ROLE 2 on the
operation's command ship. In the third phase, in October 2015, the SAF's multi-purpose boat
Triglav 11, which is SAF's main capability for participation in operations, was deployed for four
months. By the end of 2015, the crew of the multi-purpose boat Triglav had successfully carried
out five search and rescue (SAR) operations at sea, rescued slightly less than 600 illegal
immigrants and destroyed five vessels.

## PROTECTION AGAINST NATURAL AND OTHER DISASTERS

### 1 PREVENTIVE ACTIVITIES

**1.1 Preventive activities**

One of the fundamental approaches of prevention activities is the provision of protection against
natural and other disasters, including fire protection and protection against drowning, at a
system level, which regulates the implementation of individual activities in line with the
normative acts for the broadest spectrum of expert and lay public.

The Administration of the RS for Civil Protection and Disaster Relief (ACPDR) also coordinates
other preventive activities for purposes of improvement of the level of readiness for and
response to natural and other disasters. The emphasis lies on the modification, system
development and normative regulation of the field of protection against natural and other
disasters, fire protection and protection against drowning. In the areas of fire protection and
protection against drowning, the ACPDR plays the role of an administrative body in relation to
the implementation of individual measures. It devotes special attention to the training of the
population in the application of personal and collective protection against natural and other
disasters, which is carried out by means of different tools and approaches and which is oriented
towards specific target groups (first and foremost to children, the young, and to the largest
target population, etc.). The training of the expert public, namely those responsible for carrying
out fire protection measures, technical examiners of installed active fire protection systems, fire
extinguisher repairers, lifeguards, people qualified in water rescue, planners, firefighters and
others, was conducted in the form of consultations, seminars, workshops and other applicable
forms.

In the field of fire protection, the Rules amending the Rules on the minimum technical and other
conditions for the maintenance of manual and mobile fire extinguishers provided a normative
redefinition of a number of ideas, service maintenance of fire extinguishers, and other forms of
arrangements between the fire extinguisher service personnel and manufacturers. Particular
circumstances were also regulated, in case service personnel are no longer capable of meeting
the conditions required for carrying out maintenance work based on a maintenance contract or
any other form of arrangement concluded with the manufacturer. These conditions define the
application procedures for fire extinguisher maintenance works.

20/115


-----

In the field of fire protection, the MoD defined the conditions and the manner of carrying out
individual fire protection measures and exercising the related powers for the inspection and
testing of fire extinguishers, hydrant networks and the installed active fire protection systems, as
well as the conditions for performing fire safety, and implementing fire protection measures. The
prescribed tasks were carried out in the field of monitoring and declaration of wildfire hazards.
On the basis of public interest in the area of fire protection, 140 authorizations were issued.

With regard to protection against drowning, the ACPDR, in addition to introducing systemic
regulation of the field, carried out tasks related to the physical and mental fitness of lifeguards
and people qualified in water rescue, and carried out testing of their training level. It granted
authorizations for the implementation of programmes for the training of lifeguards, determined
organizational measures for the protection against drowning in public bathing areas, and so on.

The ACPDR is one of the holders of spatial management in the preparation of state, intermunicipal and municipal spatial planning documents. It cooperates with competent
organizations and bodies by issuing guidelines and opinions from the field of protection against
natural and other disasters and fire protection. Spatial, urban, construction and other technical
measures are implemented in the course of spatial and urban planning and construction in
order to prevent or mitigate harmful effects of natural and other disasters and to facilitate
protection, rescue and relief. In order to provide fire protection measures during the preparation
of spatial planning documents, provision should be made for the safe evacuation of people,
animals and property, the necessary separation between structures or the necessary fire
protection separation, and accesses, driveways and work areas for emergency vehicles, as well
as the resources for the suitable supply of water for fire-fighting. In 2015, 126 guidelines and
183 opinions on spatial planning documents in the field of protection against natural and other
disasters and fire protection were issued. All activities related to spatial planning conferences
were also carried out.

Personal and mutual protection includes measures of the population for self-help and for the
provision of assistance to others. In the event of natural or other disasters, fire or risk of
drowning, personal and collective protection includes activities involving non-compulsory forms
of training of the population, young people and children by providing current warnings and
instructions for the population, cooperating with the media and preparing various activities and
materials for the population. In 2015, evacuation was the main topic of a project entitled October

- the Fire Safety Month, which was aimed at different target groups. Several consultations were
carried out for the expert public and the general population, and for the purposes of promoting
the system, including events related to the 112 number, etc. Leaflets and posters were issued
and distributed, displaying information for the population on the implementation of personal and
collective protection. By means of websites, the media, different approaches and publications,
the ACPDR accessed a number of different target groups, such as young children, teenagers
and graduates. Just as in previous years, the ACPDR was granted participation in the

21/115


-----

Children's Bazaar and a puppet show for children was organized all across Slovenia. In
addition, the ACPDR produced a web application with instructions for the use of the 122
emergency call number, called Napotki - 122 (Instructions - 122) for smartphones. The ACPDR
also prepared four short training films on evacuation intended for both the expert and the lay
public. The "house" online application, presenting the measures to be taken in a house in the
event of earthquakes and floods, was prepared and upgraded. We reached the youngest
children through the Zmajček and Ciciban magazines, and the older, high school children and
students through tools tailored to their needs. The emphasis was placed on the current topics.
The ACPDR participated in other events for children, teenagers and the rest of the population
with various activities from the field of protection against natural and other disasters.

A number of reprints of materials with information regarding the application of personal and
collective protection in the event of certain accidents (protection against drowning, fire
protection in the international environment) were made. The ACPDR prepared flyers on
accidents involving radioactive substances, and flyers regarding the "house" online application
and the online mobile application. A banner for the _www.filternet.net online media was also_
produced and advertised. Four training films on evacuation were advertised.

In addition to the provision of training to the population concerning the implementation of
personal and collective protection, a systematic training of the expert public was also organized.
In the field of fire protection, the ACPDR prepared a presentation of the draft Rules on the BuiltIn Systems of Active Fire Protection for the expert public, i.e. the technical inspectors. In the
context of the project October - the Fire Safety Month, the ACPDR prepared a consultation on
evacuation and a consultation entitled Protection against Drowning for lifeguards. For local
communities and ministries, the ACPDR organized a consultation on the subject of risk
assessment. The materials from the consultations were published on the ACPDR website.

**1.2 The Normative Working Programme of the Government of the Republic of Slovenia –**
**the ACPDR**

The following implementing regulations of the Government of the RS from the ACPDR's
competence were included in the Normative Working Programme of the Government of the
Republic of Slovenia for 2015:

### 2 PREPAREDNESS OF THE SYSTEM OF PROTECTION AGAINST NATURAL AND OTHER DISASTERS AND PROTECTION, RESCUE AND RELIEF FORCES

**2.1 Planning**

In compliance with the Decree on the Implementation of the Decision on a Union Civil
Protection Mechanism defining the implementation of risk assessments for accidents, the
ACPDR, in its role as the national coordinating body for accident risk assessments, continued to
prepare supporting documents for the elaboration of risk assessments for individual accidents;
reported to the interministerial working group for risk assessments and accidents and to the
Government of the RS on the implemented activities; coordinated and monitored the
implementation of risk assessment processes for accidents together with holders and
participating bodies; prepared the National Disaster Risk Assessment in cooperation with
holders; prepared a report on the elaboration of risk assessments for the European
Commission; and following the Government's decision, reported on the subject to the European
Commission, etc. In the role of the holder, the ACPDR prepared the Ice Storm Risk
Assessment. The preparation of risk assessments is related to the Partner Agreement between
the Republic of Slovenia and the European Commission for the absorption of EU Structural and
Investment Funds.

In connection with the implementation of the Decision on a Union Civil Protection Mechanism,
activities also commenced in the preparation of risk management capability assessments and in
the preparation and improvement of risk management planning where practically all ministries
are actively involved, as in the case of risk assessment. The ACPDR plays a role primarily in
system-related work, the coordination and development of joint national documents and
reporting to the European Commission.

Protection and rescue plans provide for an organized and coordinated operation to prevent
disasters or minimize their consequences. The ACPDR, in cooperation with the ministries,
prepares national disaster response plans, submits those plans to the Government for adoption,
and reports to the Government on the preparation of action plans which fall within the
responsibility of individual ministries.

In accordance with the Protection Against Natural and Other Disasters Act, in 2015, the ACPDR
updated the National Disaster Response Plan for Outbreaks of Transboundary Animal
Diseases, the National Disaster Response Plan in Case of Terrorist Attack with Means or
Weapons of Mass Destruction, or With Conventional Means, the National Disaster Response

23/115


-----

Plan in the Event of a Railway Accident and the RS Civil Protection Commander Defence Plan.
With the new resolution of the Government of the RS, it harmonized the National Preparedness
Measures and the NATO Crisis Response Measures. It submitted the National Disaster
Response Plan for the Occurrence of Communicable Diseases in Humans to the RS Civil
Protection Headquarters for consideration. The ACPDR updated the National Risk Assessment
for Outbreaks of Transboundary Animal Diseases, the National Threat Assessment for the
Occurrence of Communicable Diseases in Humans, the National Risk Assessment in the Event
of a Railway Accident and the National Risk Assessment in the Event of a Large Wildfire. In
accordance with the work plan, a proposal for the operation of the information centre was
prepared and submitted for coordination.

The permanent annual distribution of potassium iodide tablets for citizens living within a radius
of ten kilometres of the Krško Nuclear Power Plant was postponed to February 2016.

**2.2 Operational Planning and Preparedness**

Operational preparedness of the system of protection against natural and other disasters is
provided through the continuous operation of notification centres and public rescue services,
and through the preparedness of other rescue services, commissions, commanders, units and
civil protection (CP) headquarters. Trained, equipped and motivated CP commanders and
members of rescue services, commissions, units and CP headquarters ensure an appropriate
and coordinated response to natural and other disasters. The achieved level of preparedness of
response to natural and other disasters was maintained.

The Programme for the Formation of National Material Reserves for Protection, Rescue and
Relief during the Period 2009-2015, which provides for the materiel and equipment from state
reserves to help the affected people and the population at risk after natural and other disasters,
as well as personal and collective equipment for the operation of the protection, rescue and
relief (PRR) forces, was implemented to a smaller extent.

With the financially-limited realization of the programme for the supplementation of state
reserves of material resources, gas cylinders, undersuits, dry suits, buoyancy compensators,
diving regulators, protective clothing and small communication equipment were provided to the
Rapid Response Unit, including the maintenance of equipment and the national reserves
assets, which will have a positive effect on the readiness and responsiveness of the system in
the event of accidents involving hazardous substances.

The ACPDR provides a comprehensive and responsive logistics system of 13 regional logistics
centres to support the protection, rescue and relief forces at the regional level, and of the
National Logistics Centre to support the national civil protection units.

**2.3 Protection, Rescue and Relief Forces**

Protection, Rescue and Relief Forces were activated. They carried out 14.533 emergency
response operations. As many as 19,918 structures of the protection, rescue and relief forces
were activated, which is a total of 121,850 members of different units, services and structures.

_January 2016._

Based on the Decree on Civil Protection Service (Official Gazette, Nos. 1/2008, 99/08 and
45/14), the ACPDR, as the founder, organizes CP units, services and bodies to carry out
protection, rescue and relief tasks at the national and regional levels, and plans the completion
of employment contracts for work in the field of CP with CP members and candidates for
employment in accordance with the Decision stipulating Priority Manning with the contract Civil
Protection members (No. 833-16/2011-15 dated 12th December 2012).

The contracts were primarily concluded for the manning of units, services and CP bodies
organized by the ACPDR at the national and regional levels: units for search and rescue in the
urban environment; support services – catering department; mobile stationary; technical rescue
teams with specialized mobile dispensary and devices; support services – medical care teams;
rapid response unit HQ; IT support unit; and psychological assistance units. In 2015, we
concluded four new contracts, 21 annexes for the extension of contracts, and terminated one
contract. A total of 115 contracts for employment in CP were concluded.

At the end of the year, the Civil Protection records listed a total of 54,241 protection, rescue and
relief forces members, of which 33,266 were members of duty units and 20,975 were
volunteers. The protection, rescue and relief forces at the national level included approximately
840 professional members, 1,200 voluntary members and 1,488 members of duty units.

**2.4 Protection From Unexploded Ordnance (UXO)**

Protection from UXO is organized as a single measure throughout Slovenia, and comprises the
detection, identification, disposal, transportation, storage and destruction of UXO, and the
training of members of the National Unit for Protection from UXO. In 2015, the National Unit for
Protection from UXO carried out 477 emergency responses (on average 1.3 a day), in which
7,439 pieces of various UXO were disposed (on average 20.4 pieces a day), or 8,789.024kg (on
average 24,08kg a day).

Three periodic destructions of UXO were carried out at the protection and rescue training range
Poligon 208:

  - (7-10 April 2015), destruction of 4,963 pieces with a total weight of 7,574.82kg
(transferred from 2014),

  - (31 July 2015), destruction of 3306 pieces with a total weight of 2,513.71kg,

  - (9-11 November 2015), destruction of 549 pieces with a total weight of 2,125.70kg.

Twenty-five destructions were carried out at the site of the find or in its near proximity, due to
the very poor condition of the UXO that was found there. During these destructions, as many as
93 UXO pieces, with a total weight of 965.45kg, were destroyed.

In addition to their regular activities, members of the National Unit for Protection Against UXO
also carried out the following extraordinary activities or large-scale emergency responses:

  - Destruction of 24 UXO pieces on the slopes of Krn, 2,100m above sea level
(November).

  - Destruction of 27 UXO pieces during a preventive cleaning operation of the
Kostanjevica na Krasu Voluntary Fire Brigade (November).

  - Four preventive inspections of the terrain by prior instruction of the owner or the
investor.

The new Rules on Protection against Unexploded Ordnance (Official Gazette of the RS, No.
2/2015, dated 9 January 2015), the new Instructions on the use of the Poligon 208 for
protection, rescue and relief activities in the field of UXO protection, and the Rules for the
calculation of compensation and reimbursement for the execution of protection against UXO
were adopted.

In 2015, 32 members of the National Unit for Protection against UXO carried out measures for
protection against Unexploded Explosive Ordnance.

**2.5 Provision of Conditions for the Operation of Protection, Rescue and Relief Forces**

The operational part of the system of protection against natural and other disasters is primarily
based on voluntary rescue services and other structures organized by associations and NGOs.
The subsidy provided by the ACPDR represents over 75% of the total funds required for the
operation of individual units. Such operation includes the ongoing training and practice of unit
members, members’ medical examinations and insurance policies, payment of salaries and
reimbursements for the loss of income to employers during the call-up of members, purchase
and maintenance of their collective and personal protection and rescue equipment, and material
costs of emergency response operations.

_Co-Funding Rescue Services, Associations and Other Organizations_
Co-funding of the activities of services, associations, units, companies, institutes and other
organizations active in the field of protection, rescue and relief was carried out on the basis of
the designed criteria, and provided funds, through contracts or annexes to the current contracts
for co-financing the protection, rescue and relief activities, amounting to EUR 7,451,902. These
funds ensured the operational preparedness of professional rescue services, fire brigades of

27/115

general importance, associations and other organizations, and rescue services and structures
which operate on a voluntary basis.

Annexes to contracts amounting to EUR 1,990,473 were concluded with the Mountain Rescue
Association of Slovenia, Cave Rescue Service of the Speleological Association of Slovenia,
Slovenian Kennel Club, Slovenian Diving Federation, Slovenian Red Cross, Slovenian Catholic
Girl Guides and Boy Scouts Association, Scout Association of Slovenia, National Institute of
Biology, Institute of Occupational Safety, Faculty of Medicine – Institute of Microbiology and
Immunology, Faculty of Medicine – Forensic Identification Unit, Veterinary Faculty – Institute of
Microbiology and Parasitology, Jožef Stefan Institute, Velenje Coal Mine, TKI Hrastnik (a

Slovenia, CB Radio Club Soča and the following flying clubs: Josip Križaj Ajdovščina, Postojna,
Tolmin, Zagorje ob Savi, Coastal Flying Centre Portorož, Slovenj Gradec Airport, and Kras
Flying Centre Divača.

_Co-Funding of the Firefighting Association of Slovenia_
Based on the annual programme of activities and tasks of the Firefighting Association of
Slovenia, such as organizational activities, prevention activities, firefighter training, and
publication of professional literature in accordance with the Fire Service Act and the Fire
Protection Act, several annexes to the contract were concluded with the Firefighting Association
of Slovenia, in the amount of EUR 685,000.

Based on the Criteria for co-funding of important anniversaries of Voluntary Fire Brigades
(ACPDR document, No. 8451-1/2015-1 dated 26 March 2015), the ACPDR allocated dedicated
funding in the amount of EUR 62,500 for high jubilees (110, 120, 130 and 140 years) to 30
voluntary fire brigades, and on the basis of the Criteria for co-financing the harmonized
development of territorial firefighting units, the ACPDR allocated dedicated funding in the
amount of EUR 48,000 to fire-fighting units for assistance in the purchase of protective and
rescue equipment.

_Programme of Co-Funding Fire-Fighting Units of General Importance_
The protection, rescue and relief field of wider importance, which includes rescue after traffic,
industrial and other accidents involving dangerous substances, rescue after accidents in longer
motorway and other road and railway tunnels, technical rescue tasks carried out after traffic
accidents and accidents in standing and flowing waters, and other protection, rescue and relief
tasks of general importance, are carried out by 45 fire-fighting units of general importance
(FUGI). For the smooth conduct of activities of general importance, data on influence factors in
operational areas (new roads and tunnels) as well as dual activation areas of FUGI, were
updated and complemented, taking into account double-overlap areas. Moreover, plans for

28/115


-----

2015 and reports on the utilization of funds for 2014 were evaluated, and 46 annexes to
contracts were prepared.

The programme of co-funding of FUGI was fully implemented and amounted to EUR 2,842,623.
Of that amount, EUR 152,044 was allocated to the amortization of eight special firefighting
vehicles for tunnel rescue, EUR 50,000 to the co-funding of a special vehicle for the penetration
of walls for the Škofja Loka Voluntary Fire Brigade, and EUR 40,000 for the emergency remedy
of all identified deficiencies in mass casualty trailers. The remainder of the funds were divided
between units, in line with the criteria for the allocation of funds.

In line with an in-depth analysis of the time coverage of the activities of general importance,
which was made on the basis of data from the information system for reporting on disasters and
emergency response operations (SPIN) for the period between 2010 and 2014, as well as
graphical simulations of driving times from the FUGI headquarters to the nearest FUGI (taking
into account the actual driving conditions, such as speed limits, etc.) six firefighting units were
introduced for purposes of improving time coverage. An amendment of the Decree on the
Organization, Equipment and Training of Protection and Aid Forces was proposed.

_Emergency Rescue in Long Road and Motorway Tunnels_
On the basis of contracts for the performance of operational duties in the event of road tunnel
accidents, concluded between the Motorway Company of the Republic of Slovenia (MCRS), the
MoD and individual fire-fighting units (Jesenice Fire and Rescue Service (GARS Jesenice),
Domžale Fire Safety Centre (CPV Domžale) and Celje Professional Firefighting Unit (PGE
Celje)), a total of EUR 65,499 was paid for the co-financing of the maintenance and restoration
of personal protective equipment, insurance and transport costs for tunnel firefighters.

In cooperation with the Firefighting Association of Slovenia, the final part of a planned purchase
of collective equipment for firefighters proving support in tunnel operations was made in the
amount of EUR 14,000. This final purchase concluded the total purchase of additional
equipment for firefighters providing support in tunnel operations in accordance with the criteria
for their organization and equipping.

_Co-Funding of Firefighting Protection and Rescue Equipment_
In 2015, the CPDR continued with the modernization of protection and rescue equipment of
firefighting units in voluntary fire brigades, and thus with the provision of harmonious
development of these units. A total of 583 applicants responded to the tender notice, published
in the Official Gazette of the RS, No. 17/15 dated 13th March 2015, and in the Official Gazette
of the RS, No. 19/15 dated 20th March 2015. A total of 539 co-funding contracts, in the amount
of EUR 1,705,082, were concluded for purposes of modernization of protection and rescue
equipment.

_Protection and Rescue Operations at Sea_
A procedure was carried out for the conclusion of contracts on co-funding protection and rescue
operations at sea with the companies Adria TOW d.o.o. (towing services and assistance to
ships and vessels), Prosub d.o.o. and the sole trader Mitja Petrič s.p., in the amount of EUR
38,725.

**2.6 National Material Reserves for the Event of Natural and other Disasters**

In previous years, Slovenia began to establish national material reserves (NMR), primarily for
large-scale disasters, wildfires, floods, major hailstorms, communicable diseases, etc. The
implementation of the Programme of Establishing NMR for Protection, Rescue and Relief in the
period 2009-015 ensured the planning of materiel and equipment from national reserves to help
the affected population and the population at risk after natural and other disasters, as well as
personal and collective equipment for the activities of the protection, rescue and relief forces.

Technical documents for the supplementation of NMR and the equipping of protection, rescue
and relief forces were prepared, in accordance with the plan and in the amount of the funds
provided after the supplementary budget (EUR 487,000). Fifty-one public procurement
proposals in the amount of EUR 214,634 were realized, namely the purchase of gas cylinders,
undersuits, dry suits, buoyancy compensators, diving regulators, protective clothing for the
Medium Search and Rescue Unit (MUSAR), and small communication equipment for the
National Rapid Response Unit. In addition, maintenance of the equipment in the national
reserves and units was provided.

The smaller realization of the planned activities was a consequence of the migrant crisis and the
rearrangement and use of financial resources for the purposes of migrant care i.e. for the
purchase of 1,500 folding beds (EUR 131,760), 200 tables and chairs (EUR 21,910) and tents
(EUR 48,678).

The resources and equipment of PRR units and other forces were supplemented in order to
provide and maintain an adequate level of equipping and operational preparedness of units for
their response to natural and other disasters in Slovenia and abroad.

**2.7 Delivery of Fire Fund Assets and Vehicles to Voluntary Fire Brigades**

In the area of logistics, pursuant to the Physical Assets of the State and Local Government Act
[(Official Gazette of the RS, Nos. 86/10, 75/12 and 47/13 - ZDU-1G, 50/14 and 90/14 - ZDU-1I),](http://www.uradni-list.si/1/objava.jsp?urlurid=20142075)
and with the purpose of fulfilment of the public interest in protection against natural and other
disasters, the following was transferred free of charge to voluntary fire brigades: seven vehicles,
one generator, one boat, two trailers, a motorbike, one field kitchen, mattresses, first aid bags
and various firefighting equipment.

In line with the decision of the Committee for the Management of the Fire Fund Assets, a total of
3,438 pieces of various firefighting equipment and communication resources, purchased
through the Fire Fund in the past years, were transferred to the Firefighting Association of
Slovenia.

**2.8 Fire Tax**

The eligible use of fire tax funds is laid down in Article 59 of the Fire Protection Act (Official
Gazette of the RS, No. 3/07 – official consolidated text). The use of funds for general social
importance is in the hands of the Committee for the Fire Fund Management (hereinafter the
Committee), in accordance with the annual plan for the use of the fire tax inflow, which in 2015
amounted to EUR 7,909,304.16. The Fire Fund assets ensure better fire safety in local
communities. The share of fire tax funds for local communities in the amount of 70% was
determined by a Government decision and totalled EUR 5,536,515.

In accordance with the plan for spending the fire tax funds inflow, adopted by the Committee
and based on the decision of the RS Government, 30% of the fire tax revenue was allocated to
tasks of general importance: co-financing of equipment, co-financing of operation and equipping
of firefighting units, co-financing of research into fire protection, and education and training for
fire protection. Through the purchase and distribution of resources and equipment, the
equipping of firefighting units is upgraded and improved. Part of the assets was also dedicated
to protection, rescue and relief in the field of fire protection, carried out by the Firefighting
Association of Slovenia, which is to provide and care for the further development and education
and training of the voluntary firefighting units in Slovenia.

The distribution of the means equalled 70% of the monthly inflow of fire tax funds. In 2015, 85%
of the Fire Fund Annual Plan was completed. As administrative support to the Committee, the
ACPDR placed particular emphasis on the realization and preparation of the technical
characteristics and specifications of equipment intended for purchase through public
procurement. Among the projects that remained unrealized were: development and research
assignments, firefighting equipment for extinguishing fires in the Karst region, and the
repayment of the deficit to the Slovenian Firefighting Association for medical examinations of
operational firefighters already carried out.

_Public procurement for the purchase of the planned equipment_
Purchased equipment of high value:

  - 1,092 pagers

  - 27 command pagers

  - 176 manual radio stations

  - 86 mobile radio stations

  - 129 self-contained breathing apparatuses, and twice as many for the year 2016, which
were delivered and paid for in 2015

  - 25 thermal video cameras (plus an additional 25 for the year 2016, which were
delivered and paid for in 2015)

  - Small value equipment, such as backpacks (extinguisher backpacks), ropes for
helicopters, pump trailers

The financial resources planned for the processes which were not completed in 2015 were
transferred to 2016, namely, those for the purchase of a mobile chainsaw simulator, a
firefighting multi-purpose vehicle, two pump generators, equipment for the Karts warehouse and
some smaller pieces of equipment for work in the firefighting school.

31/115


-----

EUR 500,000 were planned for the purchase of firefighting vehicles for the extinguishing of fires
and high altitude rescue (vehicle ladders and airlifts). Four municipalities applied to the public
tender for the co-financing of firefighting vehicles; two of them did not meet the conditions
(Rogaška Slatina and Postojna). Funds in the amount of EUR 286,000 went to the municipality
of Sežana, and in the amount of EUR 214,000 to the municipality of Trbovlje.

Co-financing was carried out for the training of operational voluntary firefighters in the amount of
EUR 372,092, and for medical examinations of firefighters before training in the use of selfcontained breathing apparatus (SCBA), totalling EUR 150,000.

**2.9 Research and Development into Protection against Natural and Other Disasters**

In the field of research and development, an open invitation for the implementation of topics on
fire protection was published by the MoD, to which potential implementors were expected to
apply by the end of February 2016. Public procurements for the implementation of four research
and development projects which will be published on the public procurement portal at the latest
by April 2016, were also part of this process.

**2.10. Monitoring, Notification and Warning**

Operations and communications tasks regarding monitoring, notification and warning are
carried out continually 24 hours a day and 365 days a year by the National Notification Centre
(NNC) and 13 Regional Notification Centres (RNC) responding to the emergency call number
112. The operation of the RNC ensures the availability of emergency medical assistance, rapid
activation of rescue workers, mostly firefighters, and the appropriate response of various rescue
services during natural and other disasters for all citizens.

In 2015, the 13 RNCs received 491,508 emergency calls, which is on an average 1,350 calls
per day. They also received 2,249 emergency calls in the form of text messages. With 41,254
calls, July was the month with the highest number of calls, while other months averaged
approximately 38,000 calls. Firefighters were called out the most often, almost 20,000 times,
while the mountain rescue services were called out over 600 times and the rescue dog units
130 times.

People usually called during the day, between 8am and 8pm. The largest regional notification
centre, both in terms of territory and the number of inhabitants, Ljubljana RNC, received the
majority of calls, that is 121,489, followed by Maribor RNC with 57,418 calls, Celje RNC with
49,535 calls and Kranj RNC with 44,789 calls.

The operators answered 90% of the calls in less than 6.3 seconds. In 90% of all cases, the calls
lasted less than 71.4 seconds, which is a good minute. The majority of them, however, lasted
around 13 seconds. In 2015, the majority of calls, as many as 2,433, occurred on 5th October.
For comparison purposes, on 2nd February 2014, at the time of the extreme weather disaster
which included ice storm, they received the most calls in the previous year, i.e. 9,538 calls. The

32/115


-----

average response time in that year was 6.5 seconds, and the number of calls made to the 112
number was 581,314, with an average of 1,600 calls per day.

The majority of calls made to the 112 emergency call number results in the activation of rescue
units and emergency response operations. The main reason for the calls remained the same in
2015; people called the number over 77,000 times because they needed emergency medical
assistance. In such events, the operator in the RNC transferred the call to the nearest medical
assistance centre. Information on the number of emergency medical assistance calls followed
by an emergency response operation are kept at the emergency medical assistance centres,
which also decide on the level of the emergency and the type of the emergency response
operation required.

The ACPDR keeps the data on the interventions of all other rescue services. Most interventions
were carried out by firefighters; 12,000 by the firefighters of voluntary fire brigades and slightly
more than 7,500 by professional firefighters. The mountain rescue service was activated over
600 times, the dog rescue units 128 times, the underwater rescue service 21 times and the
cave rescue service 17 times.

In 2015, there were no extreme events (such as the ice storm and a number of major floods two
years ago); nonetheless, the regional centres received most calls during floods, between 14th
and 18th October, the majority of which, 2,433, were made on 15th October 2015.

The number of all the telephone conversations conducted by operators following a call received
to the 112 emergency call number amounted to 690,022 (including incoming calls which the
operators conducted with the intent of activating and informing units, services and individuals,
as well as return calls to callers of the 112 emergency call number).

**2.11 Communication and Information Systems (CIS)**

With the 1st of December 2015, the automatic call from a damaged vehicle, the 112 eCall, was
introduced. By the end of the year, the RNC had received 28 messages.

All RNCs established separate primary communication channels for calls made to the 112
emergency call number. The possibility of taking priority calls made to the 112 call number from
the waiting line was enabled on the RNCs telephone dispatcher terminals. To this end, the
Ljubljana and Kranj RNCs were upgraded already in 2014. The remaining RNCs received their
awards in 2015.

One hundred and twelve outdated personal computers were replaced with new ones. The
ACPDR concluded contracts for the maintenance of radio stations and pagers.

Due to the lack of funds, the renewal of the public warning system was not carried out to the
planned extent. Instead of the planned 106 sirens, only two were renovated.

In the context of the COSMASIR project, the staff room for the management of responses in the
event of disasters was modernized and renovated with new equipment: a video wall, ceiling
projectors and some computers and monitors.

The ACPDR was involved in the following European project: the ESA-IDRC project (as the end
user) and the EPISECC project (in the advisory committee).

The ACPDR is participating in the i-HeERO project as a full member. The i-HeERO project is
intended for the development of the automated call from a damaged vehicle, the eCall, with
emphasis on cargo vehicles transporting dangerous substances and on the development of the
next generation eCall.

The ACPDR participated in the ESA-IDRC project as the representative of the end users in the
testing and collection of data for purposes of upgrading the EMERGENCY.LU module.

**2.12 The Migrant Issue**

The ACPDR became actively involved in preparations for the solving of the migrant situation,
actively participated in the operational group at the Ministry of Internal Affairs and, following the
decision of the Government of the RS, dated 20th September 2015, to set up temporary
accommodation centres due to the possibility of the mass arrival of migrants and to put CP in
charge of their provision, later also coordinated the work of the reception and accommodation
centres. Civil Protection was tasked with providing temporary dwellings in accommodation
centres, establishing foundations for the functioning of the centres, and coordinating the fair
participation of all stakeholders. Together with competent bodies, rescue services, and
humanitarian and non-governmental organizations, the ACPDR organized the reception and
accommodation of migrants, provided food and other life-essential provisions as well as first aid,
helped reunite families, and provided protection and other required services. The RS CP
Commander appointed heads of accommodation centres and their deputies by means of formal
decisions.

Following the Decision of the Government of the RS, all the conditions for the activation and
appropriate application of protection and rescue plans for the implementation of protective
measures and protection, rescue and relief tasks, which refer to the accommodation and care of
the population at risk, were met, and the activities were coordinated by the RS CP Commander.
The adopted Decision provided the basis for:

  - The activation of units, protection of members, and payment of direct costs and refunds.

  - Payment of members.

  - Deployment of units across the entire state territory and

  - Faster implementation of public procurements.

_Migrant Care_
Activities for the establishment of the conditions for the reception of migrants began as early as
16th September 2015, with the transportation of materiel from the National Logistics Centre
Roje and the Regional Logistic Centres to the vicinity of the reception and accommodation
centres (tents, emergency beds and blankets), with the provision of logistic support during the
setting-up of the reception and accommodation centres (providing electricity, water, toilets and
washrooms in the facilities) and the setting-up of tents and equipping them with beds and
bedding. All the activities were conducted in cooperation with the Ministry of Internal Affairs and
the representatives of the local communities, societies and organizations included in the
protection and rescue system, as well as humanitarian and non-governmental organizations.
The reception and accommodation centres were set up in six regions. All employees of the
ACPDR regional offices were included in the activities, performing tasks and establishing
capabilities for the organization of the reception and accommodation centres, the provision of

34/115


-----

their operation and the management of the accommodation centres. In cooperation with the
Ministry of Labour, Family, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities and the Employment Service
of Slovenia, the ACPDR concluded 259 employment contracts with community work providers
for the purposes of providing assistance in the management of migration flows.

The ACPDR prepared instructions for the work in accommodation centres and coordinated the
work with humanitarian and non-governmental organizations. It also provided support to the CP
Commander by organizing work in the RS CP Headquarters support group. Work in the
accommodation and reception centres was organized based on the needs and the number of
migrants, the time of their arrival and the duration of their stay.

_List of locations of accommodation and reception centres (2015)_

In October 2015, the RS requested international assistance at a bilateral level and through the
EU Civil Protection Mechanism for the purposes of providing accommodation and care to the
migrants. Numerous countries responded to Slovenia's request for material, technical and
protective equipment. Assistance was provided by a total of 13 countries.

35/115


-----

Representatives of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) acted as
support in most of the accommodation and reception centres. The UNHCR provided not only
translators, but also specific materiel for migrant care. Assistance was also provided by the
International Organization for Migration (IOM), UNICEF, the Council of Europe Development
Bank and a number of foreign NGOs.

In 2015, care was provided for 382,209 migrants in both reception and accommodation centres.
On average nearly 5,000 migrants entered Slovenia on a daily basis. However, the greatest
pressure on the border occurred on 21st October, when as many as 12,616 people came into
Slovenia from Croatia.

In 2015, 29,730 CP members, members of different PRR organizations and societies (scouts,
firefighters), humanitarian organizations (the Slovenian Red Cross, EHO Podpornica), NGOs
(Slovene Philanthropy, Adra, Sloga and others), volunteers, community work providers and
public employees were included in the provision of accommodation and care for the migrants
and in the provision of the necessary materiel.

By 31st December 2015, EUR 3,054,443 had been released for migrant care.

### 3 DISASTER RESPONSE AND DAMAGE ASSESSMENT

**3.1 Disaster Response**

In 2015, 14,533 different events occurred in Slovenia (natural and other disasters, road traffic
accidents, fires and explosions, pollution, accidents involving dangerous substances, nuclear
and other events, findings of unexploded ordnance, supply disruptions, damage to facilities and
technical and other assistance). In addition to other services, the PRR forces also responded to
these events.

_Events in 2015_

**Event** **Number of Events**

Natural Disasters 828

Other Disasters 1,491

Road Traffic Accidents 2,347

Fires and Explosions 4,214

Pollution, Accidents Involving Dangerous Substances 694

Nuclear and Other Events 64

Findings of UXO, Supply Disruptions and Damage to
804
Facilities

Technical and Other Assistance 4,091

**Total** **14,533**

_Data on events in 2015 are based on reports completed by 21st January 2016._

A closer look at the events reveals that the accidents resulted in 18,107 emergency response
operations, with the participation of 109,180 members of various PRR forces. The greatest
number of emergency response operations took place in July (1,895), followed by October
(1,807) and August (1,651). The majority of emergency response operations were carried out by
the voluntary territorial fire brigades, professional firefighting units, the National Unit for
Protection from UXO and the Mountain Rescue Association of Slovenia. With timely and
effective response and help to those affected, protection, rescue and relief forces undoubtedly
contributed to the mitigation of damage and other consequences caused by these disasters.

**3.2 Damage Assessment**

Damage assessment after natural and other disasters in agriculture and on specific objects and
things was carried out by qualified appraisers according to the prescribed methodology and in
parallel with the regular maintenance of the AJDA application. Appraisers concluded contracts
for work in field conditions.

The ACPDR is responsible for good qualification of appraisers and a unified damage
assessment system. Consequently, four training courses on damage assessment were carried
out for the newly appointed members of municipal and regional commissions. During this
training, the participants were introduced to legislation and the AJDA damage assessment
application, and learned about field experience on damage assessment of crops and objects
and the granting of national aid for recovery and reconstruction after natural disasters. The
training, with a total number of 221 participants, was carried out in Šentjernej, Celje, Ig and
Murska Sobota.

A new contractor for the upgrading of the AJDA application, the Urban Institute of Ljubljana, was
also selected.

The assessment of direct damage to property resulting from the consequences of floods which
occurred between 6th and 14th November 2014 in 29 municipalities in the Gorenjska, Ljubljana,
Koroška, Notranjska, Podravska, Vzhodnoštajerska, Zahodnoštajerska and Zasavska regions
was completed. The total estimated damage, which stood at EUR 22,252,930, included damage
to property (EUR 3,069,765), damage to the economy (EUR 847,908), damage to national
roads (EUR 300,000), damage to forest roads (EUR 2,327,238), and damage to watercourses
(EUR 15,728,017).

**3.3. EU Solidarity Fund**

At the end of January 2014, Slovenia was affected by a winter disaster which lasted for over a
month. The most damage, however, was caused between 30th January and 27th February. As
the assessment of the direct damage and the emergency response expenses reached EUR
428.5 million (without VAT), the RS submitted an application to the EU Commission for
assistance in the form of a non-refundable grant from the EUSF. Slovenia was entitled to EUR
18,388,478 without VAT from the EUSF. At its 20th session, on 29th January 2015, the
Government of the RS adopted the Information on the EU Solidarity Fund for winter disaster in
February 2014 with the Resolution No. 54400-1/2015/4. It also appointed the implementing
institutions and the payment dynamics:

**Institution** **Total** **2015** **2016**

Ministry of Infrastructure 7,186,478 3,726,662 3,459,815

Ministry of the Environment and Spatial
6,400,000 3,520,000 2,880,000

Food

Administration of the RS for Civil
4,300,000 2,251,337 2,048,662
Protection and Disaster Relief

On behalf of the MoD, the ACPDR received EUR 2,251,337 in 2015 for the reimbursement of
emergency response expenses incurred during the winter disaster to municipalities.

The municipalities requested and received grants from the EU Solidarity Fund for the
reimbursement of expenses incurred during the emergency response (through the provision of
temporary accommodation and the financing of rescue services for the provision of assistance
to the affected population) during floods, deep snow and ice storms between 30th January and
30th April 2014. The funds which the municipalities are entitled to are intended for the
reimbursement of expenses of disaster response units and services (firefighters, CP and others
– this also applies to foreign rescuers), expenses required for the establishment of infrastructure
or for the protection of facilities, expenses required for the protective measure of evacuation and
all expenses related to equipment (emergency purchase of equipment).

The municipalities submitted their claims to the ACPDR by filling in the form in Annex 4 – The
Bill of Costs for the Reimbursement of Emergency Response Expenses to Local Communities,
Directions for the implementation of procedures for the use of resources from the EU Solidarity

39/115


-----

Fund in the RS received for the restoration of consequences of the winter disaster of February
2014.

With a view to assisting the municipalities with filling out the stated annex, the ACPDR sent
them a document entitled Reimbursement of Expenses from the EU Solidarity Fund for the
winter disaster of February 2014 – Call for the submission of information, on 24th August 2015.
The municipalities submitted the claims in the form, provided for in Annex 4, for inspection to
the authorized people at the ACPDR (heads of competent ACPDR regional offices) who
checked, verified and confirmed all claims, attachments, account cards and the eligibility of
expenditures stated in the claims for the reimbursement of emergency response expenses.
Based on the documentation, it was established that the material under concern referred to the
reimbursement of amounts paid for the purposes of the implementation of emergency
responses in the ice storm event of 2014, during the prescribed period, and that the material is
compliant with the prescribed rules. The ACPDR withdrew or refuted individual claims which did
not meet the prescribed criteria or were lacking an appropriate basis in the documentation.

In 2015, the ACPDR thus executed all transactions to municipalities and spent all the resources
earmarked to this end, namely EUR 2,251,337.

42/115


-----

The following new programmes were developed:

  - Training programme for diving instructors who teach technical diving.

  - Programme of supplementary training for members of other rescue services and units
for response in the event of a nuclear or a radiological accident.

  - Programme of supplementary training in the preparation and implementation of
exercises in the field of protection against natural and other disasters.

  - Programme of supplementary training for candidates for the heads of firefighting units'
proficiency examination.

  - Programme of introductory training for PRR forces members on the system of
protection against natural and other disasters.

Eight programmes are being updated:

  - Programme of introductory training for public employees in civil protection.

  - Programme of introductory training for public employees in notification centres.

  - Programme of supplementary training for public employees in notification centres.

  - Programme of the supplementary training - Protection and Rescue Application (ZiR).

  - Programme of supplementary training on public relations.

  - Programme of introductory training of CP Commissioners.

  - Programme of basic training for firefighters on intervention in single-tube tunnels.

  - Programme of basic training for fire-fighters on intervention in double-tube tunnels.

Five programmes are being prepared:

  - Programme of further training of candidates for the proficiency examination for
commanders or operational heads of firefighting units.

  - Programme of further training for CP Commanders.

  - Programme of supplementary training for members of technical rescue units on the
execution of measures in the event of floods, thunderstorms and avalanches.

  - Programme of training for firefighters on the management of working groups and
sections during emergency responses.

  - Programme for the management of emergency response at the level of unit leaders.

During the reporting period, seven programmes were updated and five new programmes were
written.

In January 2015, a working group was appointed for the preparation of proposals for the mutual
coordination of the contents of educational programmes for the basic training of voluntary
firefighters and the contents of educational programmes for the education of professional
firefighters with upper secondary technical qualification. A chronology of the implemented
activities regarding the coordination of the content in the period of 2005-2010 was prepared and
submitted to the members of the working group together with the current training programmes
and a comparative overview.

43/115


-----

Following a comparison of different programme contents, the working group established that the
contents of the programmes for the basic training of voluntary firefighters and the contents of
the training programme for the professional firefighters are not directly comparable. In addition
to the basic and advanced firefighter courses, the training programmes for voluntary firefighters
also include a course for the heads (of a group, unit/section, units/platoon, company, members
of higher commands and leaders in the region and in the country). The training programme for
professional firefighters, on the other hand, fully complies with the criteria of the occupational
standard. All applicable training programmes for professional and voluntary firefighters are
harmonized to a certain extent. The knowledge received through these programmes enables
course participants to carry out operational firefighting tasks.

**4.2 Implementation of Education and Training Courses**

The training of the 22nd generation of candidates for the profession of firefighter was organized
between 5th January 2015 and 18th June 2016, and lasted 24 weeks or 961 hours altogether,
of which 401 hours were intended for theory and 560 hours for practical training. The 22nd
generation comprised 27 candidates who successfully completed their training.

In accordance with the provision of Article 14a of the Rules on the Special Exams of
Professional Firemen (Official Gazette of the RS, No. 31/00, 108/11 and 35/14) the commission
for the proficiency examination of professional firefighters compared the contents of the final
exam and the proficiency examination.

In January 2015, a consultation and a workshop for professional firefighting units were prepared
on the topic of emergency response in road tunnels, in cooperation with the Slovenian
Professional Firefighter Association. The European Directive on Safety in Road Tunnels, the
concept of tunnel firefighters and firefighters providing support in tunnel operations in doubletube tunnels, the concept of education of tunnel firefighters and firefighters providing support in
tunnel operations, and the recent emergencies in Slovenian tunnels, were presented at the
consultation.

A training course in fire extinguishing in enclosed spaces was organized for firefighters from
Montenegro (seven participants).

Employees of the education and training department carried out training based on the number
of applications. They carried out all the planned training with a sufficient number of applications,
with the exception of three training courses which were rescheduled to 2016 due to the
migration crisis. For the same reason a course organized in the context of international
cooperation under the Disaster Preparedness and Prevention Initiative for South Eastern
Europe – DPPI SEE, the Disaster Risk Reduction Course, which was planned for November,
was also cancelled.

A supplementary two-day training for the proficiency examination for heads of firefighting units,
attended by 21 candidates, was also carried out. To this end, expert groundwork for the
implementation of the proficiency examination for heads of firefighting units was prepared.

The following training courses were newly prepared and implemented: Case study: The ice
storm and floods of 2014. Case study: The floods in BiH and Serbia in 2014 – Assistance
provided by the RS; the 3rd part of the public relations in the event of disasters; supplementary
training for members of commissions on the inventory of the level of damage caused to
facilities; supplementary training for members of other rescue services and units on the

response in the event of a nuclear or a radiological accident. After a number of years, training
on the preparation of protection and rescue plans (for earthquakes) was once again carried out.

In the context of the Victim Support project co-financed by the EU from the Internal Security
Fund, three training courses on the provision of psychosocial support after disasters were
carried out. In May, training was carried out by Austrian CP experts from Styria (emergencies
and our response to them; stress; psychosocial assistance for children and youth;
communication in crisis situations), while in September training was carried out by a Portuguese
psychologist who is a specialist in traumatic events (emergencies and our response to them;
psychosocial assistance teams and their activation; vulnerable groups and disaster victims; the
different ways of helping the victims, the rescuers, the community and the organizations;
organization of psychosocial assistance in the field). In October, participants from the Gorenjska
region were first introduced to psychosocial assistance for inhabitants and rescuers in the
context of the system of protection against natural and other disasters, and to psychological and
defusing discussions after accidents.

The ACPDR continued with the training of counsellors in the framework of psychological
support provided to emergency responders in firefighting units and notification centres, and with
regular supervisions for confidants providing psychosocial support. Supervision was carried out
by psychologists from the National Psychological Support Service. During supervision, the
participants were introduced to innovations in psychological assistance and support provided to
their co-workers, learned about activities carried out in this field by individual work units, and
exchanged experiences.

In the field of protection from UXO, an upgrade of the introductory and basic training
programme for members of CP and SAF units for protection against UXO was introduced
(adaptation to new technologies for the implementation of UXO protection; new equipment used
by members; adjustment of the scope of the content and the duration based on their previous
knowledge). Eighteen presentations of the system of protection from UXO were carried out by
presenting the collection of exhibits to different target groups. The collection was supplemented
with nine new exhibits.

In 2015, preparations for two planned exercises, the Accident at the Lopata Motorway Service
Area Exercise 2015 (Vaja nesreča na AC Lopata 2015) and the Railway Accident in the Posavje
Region Exercise 2015 (Vaja železniška nesreča Posavje 2015) were carried out. Due to the
involvement of both regions in the solution of the migrant issue, the exercises were rescheduled
for 2016.

_21st National Testing of the Training Level of the Civil Protection and Red Cross First Aid_
_Teams_

Eleven regional examinations of the training level of the CP and RK first aid teams were carried
out. The examinations were attended by 126 first aid teams, organized in accordance with the
Regulation on the Organization, Equipment and Training of Protection, Rescue and Aid Forces.
The national examination was attended by teams which were ranked among the best in the
previous regional training level examinations for first aid teams, together with the best runner-up
team in the regional examinations. Fourteen first aid teams qualified for the national
examination: seven RK teams, six CP teams and one team from the firefighting organizations.

The 21st National Examination of the Training Level of the Civil Protection and Red Cross First
Aid Teams was organized in Murska Sobota. It was prepared on the basis of the threat
assessment for the Prekmurje Region and the inclusion and provision of first aid in the event of
natural and other disasters. Special emphasis was placed on the provision of first aid to the
injured in the event of natural and other disasters (floods, thunderstorm, ice storm), and the
provision of first aid at public venues and in the event of mass disasters. Among the
participating teams, the highest level of knowledge and training was demonstrated by the Civil
Protection team from the Ptuj municipality, which will represent Slovenia at the First Aid
Convention in Europe (FACE) in 2017.

### 5 INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION

In 2015, international activities in the field of protection against natural and other disasters were
primarily oriented towards the strengthening of bilateral cooperation and integration at the
regional level, towards the provision of development aid to the countries of the Western Balkans
and Turkey, and the provision of Slovenia's active role in international organizations. The
ACPDR successfully participated in twelve European projects. In the previous year, the RS
provided humanitarian assistance to the inhabitants of Ukraine, deployed one landslide and
floods expert to the area of Tetovo, and assisted Hungary in the management of the migrant
situation. Through the EU Civil Protection Mechanism and through bilateral arrangements, the
Republic of Slovenia requested international assistance for the care provided to the refugees.
Thirteen countries (Austria, the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Latvia, Luxembourg,
Hungary, the Netherlands, Slovakia, Spain, Switzerland, the USA and the United Kingdom) and
a number of international humanitarian organizations responded to Slovenia's request.

**5.1 Bilateral Cooperation**

Slovenia continued its cooperation with its neighbouring countries of Austria, Croatia, Italy and
Hungary, particularly in the border area in the framework of European projects.

Cooperation with Austria was conducted through the contact committees of Austrian Carinthia
and Styria. Cooperation with Croatia continued in the context of the permanent mixed
commission for protection against natural and other disasters, and four sub-commissions. In
addition to participation in an exercise organized in the context of the European MURA 2015
Project, Slovenian rescue teams also attended the Hercules 2015 Exercise held in the border
area between Croatia and Slovenia. Cooperation with Hungary took place in the context of the
Mura 2015 Exercise and the "Let's Rescue Together" project, and in the field of international
assistance provided for purposes of managing the migrant situation. Cooperation with Italy, on
the other hand, took place in the context of different European projects, the IPA CP 2, IPA
Floods and Matilda, and at the bilateral level with the autonomous region Friuli Venezia Giulia,
with which ACPDR signed technical annexes to the Protocol on mutual cooperation in 2015. In
addition, two meetings of the joint committee Slovenia-Friuli-Venezia Giulia were also
organized. In February 2015, Slovenia and Serbia signed an intergovernmental agreement on
cooperation in protection against natural and other disasters. In the context of the mixed
commission for economic cooperation between the RS and Serbia, the two countries concluded
an agreement for further cooperation and the exchange of experience in the field of protection

-----

against natural and other disasters. In addition, the ACPDR participated in a developmental
project entitled Support to the Establishment of Voluntary Protection and Rescue Structures in
Serbia. In 2015, representatives from Kosovo visited Slovenia on two occasions with the
intention of exchanging past experiences. Also, the process of the coordination of the
agreement concerning cooperation between the RS and the Republic of Kosovo was initiated.
Cooperation with Macedonia took place in the context of the IPA CP 2 programme activities, in
the context of which the large international exercise, IPA Complex, was held in Skopje between
15th and 19th June 2015.

_The visit of the Serbian delegation to Slovenia in the context of the Project of Support to the_

_Establishment of Voluntary Rescue Services in Serbia (October 2015)_

**5.2 Regional Cooperation**

Regional cooperation in the field of protection against natural and other disasters provides a
significant contribution to the development of both national systems and to the integration of
regional capabilities during major disasters with a possible transboundary effect. The most
important regional cooperation framework is the Disaster Preparedness and Prevention
Initiative for South Eastern Europe (DPPI SEE). The purpose of the initiative is to strengthen
cooperation in the field of protection against natural and other disasters between the countries
in the region. But above all, the initiative is concerned with the transfer of knowledge and
experience and with the integration of the region into the EU Civil Protection Mechanism. In
2015, the RS participated at two regional meetings; in April 2015 in Belgrade and in November
2015 in Sarajevo. Also, lecturers from Slovenia attended numerous events in the context of the
education and training programme for protection against natural and other disasters for SEE,
and presented Slovenian experience in the management of disasters. In the context of the DPPI
SEE, the ACPDR organized two major events; in August 2015, hot fire training for firefighters at
the Ig Training Centre for Civil Protection and Disaster Relief, and in November 2015, cave
rescue training in BiH. Both training courses were intended for rescue teams from Southern
Europe.

**5.3 The European Union**

In 2015, EU member states adopted commitments in the field of protection against natural and
other disasters, to pay more attention to the needs of the disabled in the entire disaster

51/115


-----

management cycle, and to strengthen cooperation between the CP and the humanitarian
assistance players.

The ACPDR actively participated in the EU Civil Protection Mechanism, which is the main
framework for the coordination of assistance, provided by member states' in the event of major
disasters. Slovenia also received extensive assistance from other member states for the
mitigation of the consequences of the migrant situation.

In the context of the Civil Protection Committee, the ACPDR participated in the preparation of a
new work programme for 2016, which was adopted in October. Work also continued concerning
the implementation of processes for the certification of modules and other units in the European
voluntary base of the predetermined capabilities of member states in the context of the EU Civil
Protection Mechanism. The RS submitted the relevant report or the summary of the national
threat assessment to the European Commission in December.

The RS Notification Centre participated in the regular exchange of information via the Common
Emergency Communication and Information System (CECIS). In line with national quotas,
Slovenian representatives attended training courses and the exchange of information, while one
ACPDR representative took an internship at the European Emergency Response Centre
(EERC). Slovenia also participated in working groups for modules, risk assessment and the
training policy.

The ACPDR participated in discussions on major accidents involving dangerous substances
(the Seveso II and III directives), intentional sea pollution incidents, the Single European
Emergency Call Number 112 and others. An ACPDR delegation attended meetings of the EU
Civil Protection Directors General in Jurmala in April and in Luxembourg in September.

**5.4 European Projects**

In recent years, the ACPDR has taken on an active role in European projects and has become
a recognizable partner both at the European level and in the Western Balkan region. The
ACPDR also continued its successful work in 2015. These projects provide opportunities for the
development of Slovenia's system of protection against natural and other disasters and the
upgrading of the classic bilateral or multilateral international cooperation. They also provide
opportunities for the enhancement of Slovenia's contribution to the realization of the European
policy in the field of CP, and for ensuring greater developmental assistance to the region with
European funds. The work of the ACPDR in European projects was oriented towards the
following three fields: 1) the implementation of current projects; 2) the monitoring of tenders and

52/115


-----

the formation of new applications and projects; and 3) the acquisition and the submission of
information on public tenders to interested parties (rescue services, local communities etc.).

The ACPDR also participated in the implementation of 12 projects: two projects on external PreAccession Assistance (the IPA CP 2 project, in the context of which the ACPDR carried out an
extensive regional exercise, IPA CAMPEX 2015, in Macedonia, numerous training courses in
the countries of the Western Balkans, and the IPA FLOODS Projects); four projects of of the EU
Civil Protection Mechanism (a course for module and technical experts, staff exercises for CP
modules, the Matilda Project and the Mura Exercise 2015); two projects of the Internal Security
Fund (a project for the development and implementation of psychosocial assistance provided to
first responders and inhabitants after disasters, and one on the modernization of the staff room
for the management of disaster responses); one research project of the Seventh Framework
Developmental Programme (the EPISECC project); one European Territorial Cooperation
project (the GOAL project); one Connecting Europe Facility project for the period 2014-2020
(the I_HeERO project); and one project on bilateral technical assistance provided to Serbia by
the RS (support for the development of voluntary rescue organizations in Serbia). In the context
of applications to public tenders, the ACPDR obtained six new European projects, the
implementation of which will begin in 2016 and 2017.

**5.5 The United Nations Organization**

ACPDR representatives, as part of a national delegation, attended the 3rd World Conference on
Disaster Reduction, which was organized in March 2015 in Sendaiin, Japan. At the conference,
the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (2015-2030): the management of risk for
attaining resilience, which succeeded the Hyogo Action Programme for the period 2005-2015,
was adopted. In the context of the conference, the Sendai Declaration was also adopted. The
purpose of the declaration was to renew and strengthen political commitment to disaster risk
reduction.

The ACPDR implemented commitments under the Convention on the Transboundary Effects of
Industrial Accidents and the Hague Convention and implemented the United Nations guidelines
on international rescue assistance.

**5.6 NATO**

In the context of NATO, the ACPDR cooperated in competent working bodies from the CP and
the emergency planning fields, which in 2015 adopted guidelines for the strengthening of the
Allies' resistance to new security threats, stressing in particular the importance of closer
cooperation of the Alliance and the EU, the United Nations and other international players. The
Allies, including Slovenia, enabled a more active participation of their Finnish and the Swedish
partners in certain areas of the Civil Emergency Planning in NATO.

**5.7 Assistance in the Event of Disasters Abroad**

In 2015, the ACPDR monitored all major natural and other disasters and crisis situations around
the world through the Emergency Response Coordination Centre of the European Commission
in Brussels. Following the Government's decision, the RS responded to requests from affected
countries for international assistance on three occasions.

Slovenia sent material humanitarian assistance for inhabitants to Ukraine. As a response to the
floods and landslides in the Tetovo surroundings in Macedonia, Slovenia deployed one geology
expert on a 14-day assessment mission of the EU Civil Protection Mechanism. The expert
participated in the preparation of reports for the rehabilitation of consequences, including from
the legislative aspect. In response to a request for assistance for the management of the
migrant situation, Slovenia sent humanitarian assistance – ten fully equipped tents – to Hungary
in the autumn of 2015.

International cooperation during the management of the migrant situation in Slovenia, from
October to December 2015, was highly intensive. Following its request for international
assistance in the form of materiel, at a bilateral level and through the EU Civil Protection
Mechanism, Slovenia received assistance from 13 countries. In addition the UNHCR, UNICEF
and IOM, and a number of other humanitarian organizations also provided assistance to
Slovenia in the management of the situation.

### 6 INSPECTION ACTIVITY IN THE FIELD OF PROTECTION AGAINST NATURAL AND OTHER DISASTERS

The Inspectorate of the Republic of Slovenia for Protection against Natural and other Disasters
(IRSPANOD) performs inspections of the implementation of regulations in the area of fire
protection, firefighting, protection against natural and other disasters and protection against
drowning. In compliance with the Minor Offences Act, the IRSPANOD also performs the
function of a minor offence authority in the aforementioned fields. The IRSPANOD inspectors
participate in emergency response operations during natural and other disasters, as well as in
investigations into the causes of fires. As evaluators, they participate in national and regional
emergency response exercises, as well as in NATO and EU crisis management exercises. They
actively participate in the Inspection Board and in regional coordinations.

In 2014, inspectors in the field of protection against natural and other disasters carried out 4,615
inspections. Fire protection inspections were carried out in buildings with a large number of
people, and in facilities where activities that may endanger workers and nearby residents take
place. Inspectors also supervised the construction of buildings and exercised control on the
basis of reports. The inspectors participated in a number of joint actions of different inspection
bodies at the level of regional coordinations and of the Inspection Board. Moreover, inspectors
participated in firefighting emergency response operations and in determining the causes of
fires. Firefighting units were supervised with regard to meeting the prescribed medical fitness
standards for operational firefighters and for personal protective equipment.

With regard to protection against drowning, inspections of swimming pools, equipment lenders
and water activity organizers were carried out. Special attention was paid to organizers of
rafting and canyoning.

In the field of protection and rescue, inspections of companies representing a major source of
environmental risk were carried out, as well as inspections of unexploded ordnance (UXO)
storage sites. In addition, inspections were carried out in municipalities and primary schools.

Based on the Minor Offences Act, the Inspectorate of the Republic of Slovenia for Protection
against Natural and other Disasters (IRSPANOD) carried out 4,560 inspections and issued 50
payment orders. Moreover, it introduced 33 procedures for the issuing of offence decisions, and
issued 4,477 offence warnings.

The IRSPANOD carried out the task of evaluating exercises of national importance in the field
of civil protection and disaster relief. Inspectors from the IRSPANOD management and its
branch offices, together with other competent inspectors and experts from the field of health
care, firefighting and the Police, evaluated the exercises of national and regional importance:
the mass casualty exercise on a motorway Lopata 2015, the Markovec Tunnel 2015 exercise,
the mass traffic accident in the Podnanos tunnel (the Podnanos Tunnel 2015 exercise) and the
Sten Tunnel 2015 exercise.

The IRSPANOD employees were actively involved in the tackling of the migrant situation,
participating in 46 shifts. They carried out works in the CP headquarters in Šentilj and Brežice
and in the group for the provision of support to the RS's CP headquarters.

Due to the lack of inspectors in individual areas of the country, and in order to ensure an even
range of inspections in Slovenia (which, within the competence of the IRSPANOD, provides a
uniform standard of safety for the citizens of Slovenia in the area of protection against natural
and other disasters), 2015 saw the continued implementation of the concept of the provision of
uniform criteria to perform inspections in Slovenia. The work of the Inspectorate continued to be
adapted in administrative operations, where the ACPDR and the Defence Affairs Directorate of
the MoD signed an Agreement on Cooperation in the Performance of Tasks in the Field of
Administrative Operations and Maintenance of Materiel in 2013. According to this Agreement,

## THE DEFENCE SYSTEM AND CRISIS MANAGEMENT

### 1 DEFENCE POLICY AND PLANNING

**1.1 Unified Objectives of the Medium-Term Defence Programme and the MoD Business**
**Plan**

In the field of defence and business planning, unified objectives of the Medium-Term
Programme and the MoD Business Plan were determined. Unified objectives were also
included in the explanation of the special part of the MoD's Financial Plan for 2016 and 2017. In
the context of the unified structure of objectives, indicators which will be used for the future
measurement of the set medium-term objectives through the realization of annual defence
budgets were also remodelled. The unified objectives of the Medium-Term Defence Planning
and the Short-Term Business (budgetary) Planning contributed to the easier monitoring of
financial assets intended for the realization of the set objectives.

**1.2 NATO**

The Alliance focused on the implementation of commitments from the NATO Wales Summit,
September 2014, and on the preparation of the most important decisions for the NATO Warsaw
Summit, July 2016. At the core of the discussions were the implementation of the Readiness
Action Plan and the implementation of the commitment regarding defence expenditures. The
theme of the ministers meetings was the adaptation of the Alliance to provide a more efficient
response to complex conflicts with ever-increasing elements of hybrid warfare which are taking
place along the Alliance's eastern and southern borders. In this context, the ministers adopted
new Policy Guidelines in June, which set the framework of NATO's operation until the end of the
decade.

With regard to the Readiness Action Plan, the RS defended the usefulness of its measures for
all types of security challenges, even those coming from the south and south-east. Slovenia
supported a gradual and financially-sustainable approach to the formation of the Very High
Readiness Joint Task Force (VJTF) and full political control over all steps of their activation.

During the preparation of the new Policy Guidelines, the RS promoted balanced treatment of all
of the three most important tasks of the Alliance: collective defence, crisis management and
cooperative security. Together with a number of other allies, Slovenia contributed a reference to
the Western Balkans to the supplements on the security environment.

In the context of the open-door policy, the RS actively strove for the invitation to Montenegro to
join NATO which was issued at the December meeting of the foreign affairs ministers.

In July the RS was paid an official visit by the NATO Secretary General, Mr Stoltenberg, which
was his first official visit to Slovenia during his mandate. During his visit, Slovenia's efforts to
halt the reduction in the share of GDP intended for defence and gradually increase its defence
expenditure in compliance with Slovenia's economic growth were presented.

In the context of the Framework Nations Concept, the RS supported a project led by Italy.

**1.3 Common Security and Defence Policy of the EU (CSDP)**

During Latvia's presidency of the EU Council, from January to June, and the Luxembourg's
presidency from July to December, the main focus was on partnerships; in particular on the
cooperation between the EU and NATO, on hybrid operations, the strengthening of Civil-Military
cooperation and the Maritime Security Strategy of the EU, the EU Cyber Defence Policy
Framework and the EU's Comprehensive Approach, and on defence cooperation in building
capacity in support of security and development.

57/115


-----

In the light of the current security issues and geopolitical circumstances, the EU Council held a
meeting on defence in June, at which a decision on the preparation of the new Global Strategy
on Foreign and Security EU Policy was adopted. The EU High Representative, Federica
Mogherini, must present the strategy in cooperation with the EU member states by June 2016.

The new Head of the European Defence Agency (EDA), Jorge Domecq, paid an official
introductory visit to the MoD.

The November terrorist attacks in Paris marked the activation of Article 42.7 of the Treaty of
Lisbon, under which France requested assistance and support. The article stipulates that in the
event of a terrorist attack on the territory of one of the member states, other member states are
obligated to provide assistance and support in compliance with article 51 of the Charter of the
United Nations. The RS responded with participation in the EUTM mission in Mali by increasing
its contribution to up to ten members.

**1.4 Bi- and Multilateral Events and Defence Diplomacy**

Ministers Janko Veber and Andreja Katič hosted the defence ministers of Italy, Azerbaijan,
Romania, Serbia and Montenegro during their official return visits to the RS, and the Minister of
Defence of the Czech Republic during his working visit to the RS. On the margins of visits paid
to SAF members participating in the ALTHEA and KFOR operations, Minister Andreja Katič held
a brief working meeting with the Minister of Defence of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the
Minister of the Kosovo Security Forces of the Republic of Kosovo.

The MoD leadership hosted a large number of ambassadors and defence attachés accredited
to the RS in introductory and working meetings.

In April, the Republic of Slovenia signed a treaty on the Balkan Medical Task Force (BMTF),
thus officially joining the project. The purpose of this project is the establishment of a regional
medical capability for the provision of medical support in the event of natural and other disasters
and in international operations and missions.

With eight resident and two roving attachés, two defence representatives at the OSCE and the
UN, one defence counsellor in Montenegro and the Dean of the NATO Defence College (NDC)
in Rome, the scope of the defence and diplomatic network remains the same as in 2014.
Accreditations of individual defence attachés were expanded.

**1.5 International operations and missions (IOM)**

The MoD was actively involved in national decision-making processes and also took part in
decision-making processes regarding Slovenia’s participation in IOM at the international level.
In its activities, the MoD took into account the principles of the Cooperation Strategy of the RS
in IOM and promoted enhanced interministerial cooperation, more intense public diplomacy and
appropriate adaptation of the working and coordination processes in IOM. At the highest
decision-making level of the MoD, the Coordination Group for IOM continued with the practice
of regular consultations and coordination activities regarding the participation in IOM. Thus, at
the end of 2015, new guidelines for the planning of participation in IOM in the future two-year
period (2016-2017) were adopted. Taking in consideration the good practices established up to
the present time, and the identified improvements in the planning and implementation procedure
regarding participation in IOM, amendments to the Rules on the Planning and Implementation of
Participation in IOM were also adopted. In line with the provisions of the Strategy on the
Participation of the RS in IOM, the MoD participated in the preparation of the regular annual
report of the RS Government to the National Assembly regarding Slovenia's involvement in
IOM.

-----

**1.6 Preparation of the Medium-Term Defence Programme 2016-2020**

Among the MoD's most important tasks in the field of defence planning was the preparation of
the Medium-Term Defence Programme, which serves as a basis for the medium-term
development and the establishment of defence capabilities of the RS and the distribution of
defence resources between the planned defence capabilities, based on their level of urgency. In
December 2015, the proposal of the Medium-Term Defence Programme 2016-2020 was
prepared for consideration by the Government.

The Medium-Term Defence Programme 2016-2020 is based on the medium-term financial
projection, which takes into account the assessment of recovery of the RS's economic activities
and the consequent growth in GDP. It also takes into account the challenges that the country
faces in the consolidation of the general government deficit and the balancing of revenues and
expenditures in the state budget. This projection anticipates stabilization, but not yet the end of
the downward trend in defence spending, as this is expected to start slowly and gradually rising
only in 2018. Considering the extent and the level of ambitions of the RS defence system, the
financial projection will not yet ensure the necessary development of and investment in the
modernization of key defence capabilities. With the provision of one third of the investment
resources required for modernization, the development of the defence system in the period up
to 2020 will be primarily focused on the attainment of the planned extent of personnel and the
maintenance of the already established defence capabilities, with their increased maintenance
costs, and on the development of the motorized infantry and an improvement in the SAF's
soldiers’ personal equipment.

**1.7 NATO Defence Planning Capability Review for Slovenia**

Since March 2015, the preparation of the Medium-Term Defence Programme has been carried
out simultaneously with the preparation of responses to the NATO's Defence Planning
Capability Survey (DPCS) 2015/2016 in the context of step five of the NATO's Defence
Planning Process, which verifies the fulfilment of Capability Targets by the member states.
Slovenia reported the national goals, priorities and ambitions in the medium term (2015-2023),
the inventory of military and civilian capabilities that could be used by the Alliance, the defence
financial plans, and the achieved results.

Based on Slovenia's responses to the questionnaire on the planning of defence capabilities,
NATO prepared a draft estimate of its defence capabilities which was addressed during bilateral
discussions organized in Slovenia in November. At the bilateral meeting, NATO representatives
estimated that the RS has been paying a very high price for the insufficient financing of defence,
especially in the last three years. NATO also estimated that this critical lack of resources and
investment in the defence system cannot be significantly improved even by the planned modest
increase in the defence budget in the medium-term. This, as a result, hinders the realization of
Slovenia's commitments and diminishes its credibility.

**1.8 Provision and Implementation of the Unified Operation of the NATO Registry System**
**in the Republic of Slovenia**

In 2015, the Central NATO Registry or the EU Sub-Registry successfully coordinated the work
and ensured the operation of the NATO Registry System in Slovenia and the operation of the
NATO sub-registries and the EU sub-registry at the MoD. All conditions for the receipt,
traceability, sending and destruction of classified and official NATO and EU data were fulfilled in
due course and in full. The transport and transfer of NATO and EU classified and official data in
Slovenia and abroad for the needs of the MoD and also other ministries and public authorities in
Slovenia were successfully realized. In 2015, 16,180 NATO and EU documents were
transferred, which amounts to 1,348 documents per month. The Central Registry, in cooperation
with the national security authority, fulfilled and supplemented the conditions for compliance
with the security principles and security standards which Slovenia, as a NATO member state,
has to satisfy in order to ensure a unified level of protection for the data exchanged between the
member states.

### 2 SLOVENIA’S CRISIS PREPARATIONS AND RESPONSE MEASURES

In compliance with the Regulation on Defence Planning (Official Gazette of the RS, No. 51/13),
the MoD continued to implement a number of activities related to the supplementation or
development of new legal bases in the area of defence planning. It prepared guidelines on the
preparation of the crisis response measures for the entities responsible for defence planning in
Slovenia, notified and coordinated activities with the planning bodies in the RS, and provided
them with expert assistance in the supplementation and coordination of their defence plans with
new bases. Regular harmonization of all the content of the MoD Defence Plan with the new
bases and the updating of records under the MoD's competence were ensured at all times.

The MoD participated in the preparation and coordination of the texts of legal documents which
fall under the competence of other MoDs in those parts that refer to crisis management and
defence planning.

As the manager of the National Defence Plan, the MoD prepared the Report on the
Harmonization of Defence Plans with the Regulation on Defence Planning (Official Gazette of
the RS, No. 51/13). The Government of the RS was informed of the report based on which it
adopted a Decision on adoption of the Defence Plan, which is composed of defence plans of
different ministers, individual Government services, the Plan on the use of the SAF and the Plan
on the use of the RS CP headquarters.

In October 2015, the Prime Minister of the RS decided that the permanent and uninterrupted
operation of the interministerial analytical group working under the auspices of the National
Crisis Management Centre was to be established for purposes of monitoring different
phenomena and events and for the purposes of direct coordination of activities pertaining to the
response to the migrant crisis by different state authorities (Decision of the Prime Minister of the
RS, No. 012-5/2015/1, dated 23rd October 2015, No. 012-5/2015/2, dated 23rd October 2015
and 012-5/2015/6, dated 27th November 2015). Based on the Government's decision, the
interministerial analytical group provided reports to the Prime Minister of the RS on a daily basis
up to the end of 2015 (Resolution of the Government of the RS, No. 01201-8/2015/2, dated
23rd October 2015).

Some years ago, an independent communication and information network (NCMC CIS) was
established within the NCMC for the purpose of the implementation of all required
communication and information links. This network connects the most important state
authorities, government offices and companies of special importance for defence and defence
administrations. The application for communication in crisis situations was upgraded in
accordance with changes in regulations in crisis management and defence planning. The
updating and upgrading of the network continued. The network enables a more reliable and
faster transfer of data and information between the aforementioned entities.

Due to changes in real estate valuation regulations, the MoD prepared a draft amending the
Decree Determining the Compensation Fee for the Use of Inventory Means (Official Gazette of
the RS, No. 15/02 and No. 93/2015). Following the amendment of the Decree or its Annex, the
Compensation Fee for the Use of Inventory Means, the criteria for the calculation of the
compensation to be paid for the use of real estates, which the SAF is utilizing for its trainings
and exercises in line with the Material Obligation Act (Official Gazette of the RS, No. 87/01),
were changed.

In the area of protection of critical infrastructure of national importance for Slovenia,
harmonization activities between bodies responsible for different areas of critical infrastructure
and managers of critical infrastructure were carried out in line with the methodology suggested
for the formation of measures for the protection of critical infrastructure of national importance.
Opinions regarding the definition of these measures were presented and expert assistance
provided.

60/115


-----

The groundwork for the preparation of the Critical Infrastructure Act served as a starting point
for the coordination of the Act's structure and the preparation of the draft text. On the proposal
of the inter-ministerial coordination group for the coordination of preparations for the protection
of critical infrastructure, the management of which falls under the MoD, the Government of the
RS adopted a Decision amending the Decision on the Determination of Critical Infrastructure of
National Importance for Slovenia (No. 0200-2/2015/3, dated 4th June 2015).

Information on the overview of activities carried out in the field of protection of critical
infrastructure of national importance for Slovenia up to that time was submitted to the National
Security Council.

In the context of tasks carried out by the MoD in the role of the national POC for protection of
the European critical infrastructure in the RS, the participation of the MoD's representatives in
meetings, workshops and presentations organized by the EU Commission was ensured. In that
same context, responses to the Commission's initiatives, including the initiatives and proposals
provided by individual EU member states, was also ensured.

As part of the coordination of activities for the protection and rescue of the European critical
infrastructure in the RS, an introductory bilateral meeting with Croatia was organized during the
process of identification of potential European critical infrastructure, carried out in line with the
Decree on European Critical Infrastructure (Official Gazette of the RS, No. 35/11). The process
of identification of possible European critical infrastructure was repeated with the neighbouring
countries of Austria, Italy and Hungary.

The MoD began implementing the national programme for the absorption of the European funds
of the Internal Security Fund (ISF) for the areas of crisis management and critical infrastructure
protection in the EU Financial Perspective 2014-2020. In this context, the MoD took on an
active role in the preparation of the Action Plan for the absorption of funds of the AMIF and ISF
Funds (versions 1.0 and 1.1), which served as a basis for the initiation of the ISF projects. Five
projects, in the total amount of EUR 380,000, were initiated. Two of them have already been
competed (the upgrading of the crisis management information system and the upgrading and
modernization of the ICT staff room for management in the event of disasters, which stood at
EUR 132,000), while three other projects are multi-year and have a planned completion in 2018.
The implementation of an ISF project from the field of crises and risks, titled The Survey and
Upgrading of the Crisis Response Mechanisms in the RS (the Crisis Management Mechanisms)
was initiated. Under this project, proposals for the upgrading of the crisis management
mechanisms will be prepared, emphasis being on inter-ministerial cohesion and the use of
current capabilities. This project is connected to the Governmental project entitled A
Comprehensive System of Crisis Management in the RS, in the context of which a draft
structure for the management of crises at the state level will be prepared, and normative
solutions for the arrangement of crisis management presented.

With regard to construction adaptations for the needs of defence, a regular examination and
coordination of the received applications within the MoD's organizational units and constituent
bodies were ensured, despite a considerable increase in the number of applications (compared
to 2010). The Ministry regularly responded to documents received from the state authorities
responsible for geospatial planning in Slovenia by preparing viewpoints, proposals and
opinions.

Concerning issuing authorizations of the RS Government for carrying out air imaging for the
production of cartographic publications, the MoD regularly prepared resolution proposals for
government consideration. In the area of issuing consent for the conduct of research relevant to
defence, regular examination and coordination of the received applications within the MOD's
internal organizational units and constituent bodies were ensured.

In accordance with the Plan of Exercises in the Defence System and the System of Protection
against Natural and other Disasters in the year 2015, and in accordance with the Rules of
Exercises in the Defence System (Official Gazette of the RS, No. 100/13), the NATO cyber
defence exercise CC15 (Cyber Coalition 2015), NATO exercise Able Staff 15 and the NATO
crisis management exercise CMX15 (Crisis Management Exercise 2015) were organized and

61/115


-----

conducted. In addition, coordination of preparations for and participation in the execution of
international military exercises, such as Immediate Response 2015 (IR15), the MLF Clever
Ferret 2015, the Adriatic Strike 2015 and Rock Proof 4, were also carried out.

NATO organizes planning conferences within the framework of the preparations for an
individual Crisis Management Exercise (CMX), which are carried out in the Allied countries.
Experts from the member states who have professional knowledge of the areas related to the
overall contents of the exercise are also present at the conferences. In 2015, four conferences
were held for the purposes of the CMX16 exercise. A conference for the planning of events for
the NATO exercise was held in Portorož. It was attended by over 200 representatives from the
Alliance and two partner countries: Sweden and Finland. NATO representatives and the
participants of the conference rated both the organization and the execution of the conference
as highly successful.

### 3 DEVELOPMENT OF CIVILIAN CAPABILITIES 

**3.1 Civilian Functional Specialists**

The greatest effort relating to civilian functional experts was oriented towards the provision of
the continuity of their work in missions or to the preservation and strengthening of the necessary
international connections. In 2015, the NATO Advisory Team (NAT) in Kosovo had six civilian
functional experts. Two of them worked in the field of contracts and public procurements, two in
budgeting and finance, and two were charged with NAT team work coordination. In the KFOR
Headquarters, three civilian functional experts held the position of POLADs (SPECAD).

In the light of the strengthening of the civil-military cooperation, an intensive cooperation with
the Multinational CIMIC Group (MNCG) from Motte di Luivenza in Italy was organized. Within
the MNCG, the MoD participated at a conference of the CIMIC unit commanders with an
instructor who took part in the international course for civilian functional experts. The instructor
held the position of a liaison person in the MNCG. At the end of the year, participation in the
MNCG was extended for another year. The MoD also participated in the regular annual session
of the MNCG Board of Directors in Poljče.

There, new civilian functional experts received their qualifications at a course organized within
the MNCG in Italy. One MoD representative attended the NATO CIMIC Education and Training
Conference (NCTEC) in Denmark in May. The planned international CIMIC course, which was
to take place in the RS under the organization of the MoD, was not carried out.

**3.2 Cartographic and Geospatial Support to the Defence System**

In the field of mapping and geospatial affairs, the MoD continued with the development and
maintenance of the mapping system, coordinated with the Slovenian military and NATO
standards and the NATO geospatial policy for the purposes of providing mapping and
geospatial support to the SAF and to protection and rescue. In cooperation with the Surveying
and Mapping Authority of the RS and the Geodetic Institute of Slovenia, the contents of six
systemic sheets of the military topographic map of Slovenia at a scale of 1:50,000 were
renewed and printed: NL-33-04-17 Trbiž, NL-33-04-29 Kanal, NL-33-04-30 Tolmin, NL-33-07-05
Nova Gorica, NL-33-07-06 Ajdovščina and NL-33-07-11 Gradež. A new topographic map at a
scale of 1:25.000 for the area of Postojna was prepared. This is a large scale map, which
includes the Poček and Bač firing ranges and training areas. A NATO interoperable military
topographic mountaineering map, Julian Alps –West, at a scale of 1:25,000, was prepared for
the needs of the SAF in the performance of their tasks in mountain training and their
cooperation in the performance of the PRR tasks. This is an extremely accurate map equipped
with additional information which is essential for movement in the mountains. In addition, a new
Catalogue of the MoD Cartographic Material was produced in Slovenian and English, and

62/115


-----

distributed to all the countries with which the MoD has concluded an agreement on cooperation
in the geospatial field.

In cooperation with the Faculty of Civil and Geodetic Engineering the digitalization (highdefinition scanning) of the analogue reproduction originals for all of the 198 sheets of the
National Topographic Map of the RS at a scale of 1:25,000 was carried out for defence
purposes, including the 16 sheets of the Military Topographic Map (VTK) 100, produced in the
period 1996-2003. The analogue originals were submitted to the Maribor Military Museum for
storage, for they symbolize an archival and historical cartographic value and legacy.

NATO documents, policies and directives were studied, which is very important in terms of the
interoperability of geospatial data and products between the Alliance nations. The MoD was
included in the work of the most important NATO bodies in the geospatial field, and it also
monitored reports and offered appropriate responses to NATO. For the purposes of preparing
SAF members for exercises and international operations and missions, the MoD acquired freeof-charge cartographic material based on agreements concluded with the countries of the
Alliance in the geospatial field. The prescribed report on the available interoperable cartographic
templates was prepared for the area of the RS and submitted to NATO. Procedures for the
adoption of STANAGs from the geospatial field into Slovenian Military Standards continued, in
compliance with NATO's directives and recommendations.

### 4 INTELLIGENCE AND SECURITY OPERATIONS

The MoD’s intelligence and security operations were carried out in line with the Defence Act and
with the adopted annual work programme, objectives and tasks. Key tasks and objectives
referred to the provision of adequate intelligence and security support to the SAF in the RS and
abroad, as well as to national security system bodies.

To this end, the Intelligence and Security Service analyzed and assessed data intended for high
state representatives for the adoption of decisions on national and defence policy, and drew
attention to potential sources of threat to the defence system at home and abroad.

During the given period, the Intelligence and Security Service provided continual intelligence,
counterintelligence and security support to Slovenian contingents (SVKON) in Kosovo, BiH,
Afghanistan, Lebanon and Mali, and within the framework of the EUNAVFOR MED
humanitarian operation in the waters of the southern and eastern Sicily. For the purposes of
providing intelligence, counterintelligence and security support to the SAF at home and abroad,
the Intelligence and Security Service cooperated directly with the competent SAF sector.

During the period concerned, the Intelligence and Security Service actively cooperated with
partner intelligence and security services in the intelligence, counterintelligence and security
fields in the context of NATO and the EU.

The focus of security-related tasks in the Intelligence and Security Service was on detecting,
investigating and preventing security threats to people, work posts, facilities and areas of
special importance for the defence in the Republic of Slovenia and abroad. The Intelligence and
Security Service also carried out functions of detecting and preventing the activities of
intelligence services of military organizations and other bodies and organizations which pose a
threat to the defence interests of the Republic of Slovenia, the SAF or the MoD.

### 5 EQUIPPING, REAL ESTATE MANAGEMENT, STANDARDIZATION AND  CODIFICATION

**5.1 Equipping**

The implementation of the equipping projects was, as in the previous years, rather limited.
Following the preparation of the investment documentation, the projects are carried out in
phases and with a large number of procurement procedures. No resources were guaranteed for
longer or bigger projects. The implemented projects were focused exclusively on providing the
most urgent equipment to perform regular activities and to ensure the continuous readiness of
the SAF in carrying out their statutory functions and for the operation and fulfilment of the
objectives of the Alliance. The larger projects were: EOD Capabilities, Forward Air Control,
Command and Control 2 CIS Capabilities, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), Noise Reduction
Headsets, General Purpose Vehicles, NATO Air Command and Control System (ASBE), the
Upgrading of the Cougar Transport Helicopters, the Cerklje ob Krki Airfield, Light Wheeled
Armoured Vehicles (LKOV) 4x4, 60mm Mortars, engineer equipment, the ammunition depot, the
Central Firing Range and Training Area Poček, disk systems and electric vehicles. Most of the
projects commenced in previous years.

Investment documentation was prepared for those projects which will be included in the future
planning documents, and those which are planned within the framework of the Alliance’s
capabilities.

Due to the reduction in funding, no project was implemented within the framework of the Act on
the Implementation of Basic Development Programmes of the SAF during the period 20082015, which formed the basis for the systematic and continuous provision of key capabilities in
the long-term development of the SAF. The act ceased to have effect in 2015.

The largest public procurements to have been implemented were the purchase of combat
uniform items, ammunition, personal and multi-purpose vehicles, and one ambulance. Following
the conclusion of the framework agreement, one set of miniature Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
(UAV) was ordered.

In the field of protection and rescue, the largest purchase implemented was the purchase of
pagers and radio stations and a number of emergency orders on the emergence of the migrant
situation.

**5.2 Real Estate Management**

In 2015, the MoD became actively involved in the implementation of tasks required for the
energy renovation of buildings. The MoD dealt mostly with the collection and processing of data,
which are important for energy savings in buildings (facades, windows, roofs, boiler rooms etc.),
and with energy consumption for the years 2012, 2013 and 2014. To this end, a unified system
for the collection and processing of data in the ENEP application was established. Energysaving building renovations for the most energy wasteful buildings will commence, based on
energy surveys.

Project documentation for the renovation of toilet structures of the Slovenska Bistrica Barracks
accommodation facility was prepared. In addition, project documentation for the enlargement of
facilities for air traffic control is also being prepared. The MoD is in the process of meeting
project conditions for the preparation of the detailed design documentation for the purposes of
arranging the water connection of the Poganci warehouse near Novo mesto. At the same time,
the project documentation (conceptual design, basic design, and detailed design) for the
replacement of the obsolete cable conduit and the transformer station in Grosuplje had already
been prepared. The MoD dismantled the SN 20 kV transmission line with poles between the
Žeje and the Bile transformer stations, and removed conductors on the SN 20 kV transmission
line of Veliki Podlog in Cerklje ob Krki.

Works on the western part of the Cerklje ob Krki Airport are fully completed. The road section
Črešnjice-Drnovo underwent technical inspection and was later handed over for use. The MoD
is awaiting the procedure for the arrangement of plot ownership (5% of contractual obligations).
Construction of a dangerous cargo platform, warehouse and storage platform, explosive
ordnance warehouse, transport aircraft platform and the G3 connecting road is completed. The
construction of fuel depots with POL facilities decanter areas, a hangar with a platform and the
S1 road for the transportation of explosive ordnance is in place.

Because of excessive snowfall, the MoD strengthened the damaged roof construction of the
Škrilj Barracks' firing range facility. It also restored the Pečna reber telecommunications facility.
Construction, finishing and installation works, wiring and technical security were carried out in
order to ensure the operation of the Centre of Excellence for Mountain Warfare. The
reconstruction of facility no. 4 in the Baron Andrej Čehovin Barracks in Postojna has begun. The
reconstruction includes the adaptation of floors into premises which will be required by the Joint
Training Centre. The larger part of the demolition works, landscaping, and part of the
construction and building installation works have already been carried out.

Based on the energy survey of the Smelt II facility, the renovation of the building's facade and
roof commenced. The exact measurements of the existing reinforcement of the concrete are
being prepared to facilitate plans for structural renovation of construction works.

The conceptual and preliminary designs for the kitchen in the General Maister Barracks
cafeteria have been prepared. The MoD is fulfilling the contract for the monitoring of the Central
Firing Range and Training Area Postojna.

On the basis of contracts concluded for the purposes of ensuring maintenance and investment
works on facilities and the installed infrastructure in the MoD's administration, regular monthly
services and intervention repairs of elevators, air conditioning appliances, venting systems,
UPS Systems, fire extinguishers and thermal stations were carried out.

As the renovation of apartments, due to their wear, is starting to require increasingly greater
financial resources, problems with their provision began to occur, as the renovation is funded
exclusively from rents. Thus, the MoD carried out only maintenance works in the apartments.
Three apartments underwent comprehensive renovation. A total of 504 contracts were
concluded for the supply of energy products.

In recent years, the percentage of the real estate registered in the Land Register is rising. Of the
1,029 apartments managed and used by the MoD, 182 apartments are still not registered in the
Land Register, which amounts to 82.3% of the apartments. Out of 6,052 land plots, only 111 are
not yet registered in the Land Register, which amounts to 1.8% of all plots.

With the Contract on the augmentation of the earmarked funds and assets of the Public Fund,
98 apartments were transferred to the permanent ownership of the Public Housing Fund, while
33 apartments were transferred to the ownership and the use of the Brežice, Črnomelj, Novo
mesto, Postojna, Ptuj and Vipava municipalities, based on the free use contracts.

A total of 166 apartments of the Public Housing Fund remained in the MoD's record of
apartments; 147 of which are registered in the Land Register, while 12 are not registered and
proposal for registration has been submitted for seven. Out of the 166 apartments, the Public
Housing Fund still manages 146 apartments. In accordance with the MoD's approval, 20 of
them were transferred to the Ilirska Bistrica, Lendava, Pivka, Postojna, Ptuj, Slovenska Bistrica
and Vipava municipalities for use on free loan.

EUR 168,858 were invested to carry out logging works for the purposes of rehabilitation after
damage caused by bark beetles. A total of 6,159m³ in tree volume were cut down, and 1,545m³
of wood chips were produced in different depots and barracks. Wood in the amount of EUR
254,220 was sold, which means a net income of EUR 85,362.

Due to a failure to pay the rent, 29 applications for enforcement were submitted, with a total
value of EUR 22,790. An additional 47 debtors are still being proceeded against for a total

65/115


-----

amount of EUR 136,277. Ten procedures for the termination of tenancy agreements and forced
evictions were completed, and 37 debtors are still being proceeded against.

Two lease contracts and two annexes to the contract were concluded for telecommunication
facilities.

**5.3 Standardization and Codification**

In 2015, the MoD standardization plan, which includes the adoption and implementation of
Slovenian Military Standards as well as the certification of NATO standards, was not
implemented in accordance with expectations. A total of 33 Slovenian Military Standards were
adopted, resulting in a 50% realization of the MoD standardization plan. Thirty-two decisions
and orders were issued for the implementation of Slovenian Military Standards. In the process
of national certification of NATO STANAGs and STANRECs, 51 national responses were
signed, representing less than a third of Slovenia’s required commitments to NATO, which
places Slovenia in an unenviable position at the bottom of NATO's list. Since defence
standardization should be addressed in a systematic way (comprehensive), amendments to the
Defence Act were proposed. To this end the MoD will have to supplement the Standardization
Act and prepare new Rules on the Implementation of Standardization at the MoD.

In the framework of its national competence, the National Codification Bureau of Slovenia
allocated 51 new NATO codification numbers (NSNs) to Slovenian products in 2014 and
registered 33 Slovenian companies, which makes 229 altogether. On the basis of the
acquisition of new supply resources, Slovenia was registered as the user of 412 NSNs. A total
of 1594 identifications of material resources were carried out in the register of material (SKEV).
Data for identification was fully prepared in the SAP and e-ZAHMAT software environment,
which ensures quality data for use in logistics processes.

### 6 THE COMMUNICATION AND INFORMATION SYSTEM (CIS) 

**6.1 Information Security**

Key operational activities were focused on the maintenance of systems and devices for the
provision of information security in the MoD communication and information system (CIS), and
in the communication and information subsystem which provides interoperability within the
Alliance.

The MoD was responsible for the NATO Cyber Coalition 2015 exercise in Slovenia, which was
very well evaluated. The purpose of the exercise was the training of technical and operational
procedures for cyber defence, cooperation between the training audience, and making
decisions to minimize the consequences of cyber attack in the RS and in the framework of the
Alliance.

**6.2 Information Infrastructure**

The projects to replace the storage servers (Regional Centre and the Joint Operations Centre)
and the migration of data were successfully completed. All infrastructure required for the
operation of the MoD SECRET network was established and launched. The new ACPDR server
was prepared and all the information infrastructure in all of the networks managed by the MoD
was successfully maintained.

**6.3 Communication Infrastructure**

Due to the provision of communication support at public events, the MoD participated in the
Biathlon 2015 World Championship in Pokljuka, and set up temporary computer networks and
IP telephony during the international military exercises Adriatic Strike 2015 and Immediate
Response 2015. The MoD continued with the construction of the MoD SECRET CIS, with the
intention of augmenting communication and information support.

**6.4 IT Solutions**

The highest priority was given to the provision of the availability of information solutions which
had already been introduced into operational use (information system for paperless operations
– IRDG, register of material – SKEV, information system for defence and protection duties –
ISOZD, unified accounting, finance, personnel and labour costs – MFERAC, the public
procurement information system and a large number of specific applications – ISOJAN). New
functionalities and SCMS tools for the management of requirements and information incidents
were introduced.

**6.5 Development of C4I Systems**

The development of the C4I systems was oriented towards support of the SAF and the
preparation and implementation of Command and Control 2 CIS, in the context of which Static
Networks and Deployable Networks capability targets will be realized. Within the framework of
this task, the MoD prepared tender documentation, issued invitations to tender, selected the
service provider and concluded a contract which entered into force on July 2015. The MoD
participated in the CE15 international exercise. The MoD closely cooperated with the units of
the 72nd Brigade, the Military Schools Centre and the CIS Unit, providing them with expert
assistance for the implementation of the Battalion Battle Group WAN interoperability testing and
the C2 software testing in Light Wheeled Armoured Vehicles (LKOV) 4x4, and participated in
computer-supported exercises and in the education of the SAF members. The MoD participated

67/115


-----

in the adoption of STANAG 5500. The MoD was a custodian of the contract for work with
formatted message texts and participated in the preparation of the ANDA application in CBRN
reconnaissance vehicles. Due to the lack of personnel, the development of the C4I systems is
critical.

### 7 INSPECTION AND INTERNAL AUDIT ACTIVITIES IN THE AREA OF DEFENCE 

**7.1 Inspections in the Area of Defence**

In line with regulations, the Defence Inspectorate of the Republic of Slovenia (DIRS), as an
MoD body, performs inspections of the implementation of laws and other regulations, as well as
of command and control acts in the area of defence. It reviews, identifies and evaluates the
preparedness and performance of military commands, units and institutions, the status of
defence preparations, the implementation of military education and training, and the provision of
administrative and technical issues in the area of defence.

In line with the statutory provisions, the DIRS performs inspections of the implementation of the
Act on the Protection of Classified Information at the MoD and the entire area of defence. It also
inspects the MoD’s organizational units in the implementation of their administrative and
technical tasks, with the exception of the tasks and activities of the ACPDR and the
IRSPANOD.

Inspectors conduct procedures and decide on any violations in accordance with the Minor
Offences Act.

The key objectives of the DIRS for 2015 were specified in the DIRS annual work plan:

  - Provision of effective and impartial inspection of the enforcement of regulations in the
area of defence, through thematic and comprehensive inspections and through
monitoring of the completion of the measures ordered in inspection reports.

  - Provision of objective information to the MoD leadership about the observed state of the
implementation of regulations in the area of defence.

  - Preparation of action proposals for the MoD leadership for the elimination of system
deficiencies.

  - Constant modernization of inspections in the area of defence and the promotion of good
practice.

  - Performance of the functions of a minor offence authority.

  - Achievement of a higher quality of inspections through the training of inspectors, and
systematic maintenance of the integrity of the DIRS and its inspectors.

To achieve the above objectives, the chief inspector dedicated special attention to the planning
and coordination of the work of the DIRS. Based on the DIRS Work Plan for 2015, the
coordination of work was conducted through monthly and weekly DIRS Work Plans.

The DIRS carried out 49 inspections; 46 regular and three extraordinary. The inspectors
conducted these inspections over a period of 407 days. Based on the findings, a total of 226
inspection measures were issued, of which one was related to removal from work, one was on
the termination of activities which could pose a threat to people and property, and one was on
determining the responsibility of individuals for non-compliance with regulations. Other
measures referred to the elimination of imperfections and discrepancies with regulations and

68/115


-----

command and control documents. Eleven warnings were also issued in accordance with the
Inspection Act.

Of all the 226 inspection measures imposed, 166 measures were executed by 15th January
2016. The implementation deadline is still valid for 56 measures, while complaints were issued
for four of the measures. One inspection measure was cancelled by a decision adopted at the
second instance, while the remaining three are still awaiting verdict by the second instance
body. The decision on a complaint at the second instance is not within the competence of the
DIRS. However, it has an impact on the realization of inspection measures.

In accordance with the imposed inspection measures, the inspectors regularly monitored their
implementation based on the analysis of notifications on the implementation received by the
inspected entities and, if necessary, performed repeated inspections or introduced minor
offence proceedings.
The DIRS provided the Minister and the Secretary of State with up-to-date information on the
findings of inspections.

**7.2 Internal Auditing**

The MoD planned five internal audits within the framework of internal audit activities. Only two
out of the planned audits were carried out. The reason for this was a long sick leave of the
auditor. In addition to the two planned audits, two additional extraordinary audits were carried
out at the request of the MoD's leadership. The realization of the annual plan was only 40%;
nevertheless, the execution of the two audits must also be taken into account.

Regular audits included inspections of the operation of internal controls and the reliability of
proceedings in the use of entertainment expenses, protocol and occasional gifts, and the
inspection of the internal control procedures in the management of risks concerned with claims.
During the extraordinary audits, the MoD investigated the correctness of procurements for the
purchase of emblems (patches) for the needs of the SAF, and the correctness and advisability
of the conclusion and implementation of a contract on the free use of the Gaj area on the
Cerklje ob Krki Airfield.

In 2015, the Internal Audit Service issued 41 recommendations for the improvement of
operation in the audited fields. Of these, 21 recommendations have already been put info effect,
while the deadline for the realization of the remaining recommendations has not yet expired.

### 8 INVESTIGATIONS OF AIRCRAFT ACCIDENTS AND MILITARY AIRCRAFT INCIDENTS

Based on the timely investigation and analysis of aviation accidents or incidents involving
military aircraft, and conclusions on the possible causes of accidents, and the injuries and
damage caused as well as other consequences of the accident, the MoD issues security
recommendations on the basis of which measures for the prevention of new risks or dangers
and the recurrence of similar accidents to military aircraft are adopted. The timely
implementation of these measures affects the elimination or reduction of the possibility of the
loss of human lives and material damage to military equipment and facilities on the ground. The
trend towards stabilization or a decrease in the number of aviation incidents has been noted.
This positive trend is, above all, a result of endeavours invested by expert services and
commanders of aviation units. Following the Ministry of Infrastructure's request, the MoD's
Aviation Investigation Authority participated in more complex investigating procedures and in
the investigation of an accident involving civilian aircraft which resulted in loss of life, as well as
in the investigation into a SAF helicopter, recorded in the civilian register, which resulted in
great material damage, and is therefore treated as an accident.

The conclusions of the investigations and the issued security recommendations were submitted
for information to the inspection authority and the military aviation body responsible for the
control of flight safety. In this way, these two bodies were able to determine compliance with the
safety recommendations through planned and ad hoc surveillance, and consequently influence
the security of flight operations. A large number of technical defects on aircraft (aging of the
aviation fleet) were identified. The MoD would like to see supplementations/amendments to
individual aviation legal documents, as the last implementing regulation defining military aviation
was published in 2010.

In 2015, a total of 33 outstanding aviation events were reported and investigations into four
serious incidents involving military aircraft introduced. Two investigations were concluded.
Based on the investigations, 38 security recommendations were issued. The investigations of
two serious incidents, which started in 2015, are continuing. Due to the workload of the
investigators and the lack of personnel, 11 serious aviation incidents remain uninvestigated.

### 9 STRATEGIC COMMUNICATION AND COOPERATION WITH CIVIL SOCIETY ORGANIZATIONS

**9.1 Strategic Communication**

The MoD strived to maintain an open dialogue with various sections of the public, and
successfully used all communication channels which determine modern trends in
communication A great deal of attention was paid to the presentation of regular MoD tasks, in
order to achieve greater public understanding of the importance of their smooth performance to
ensure the security of citizens.

In notifying the internal and wider public, the MoD followed the endeavours of the MoD's
leadership which, on a number of occasions, stressed the importance of the provision of an
appropriate level of security to citizens, the significance of the negative monetary gap in
defence, and the importance of public notification of the reasons for the renovation of individual
basic legal documents, such as the Defence Act and the Resolution on the National Programme
of Protection Against Natural and Other Disasters 2016-2020. From September, a large
proportion of communication activities referred to the solution of the refugee and migrant
situation, in the context of which the RS activated the European CP Mechanism in October
2015, while the National Assembly of the RS adopted an amendment of the Defence Act. The
MoD regularly published press releases, organized press conferences, and published
statements from the authorities, as well as answering numerous journalists’ questions on
migrant and refugee care, the participation of SAF members in the protection of the border, and
activities carried out at the international level. Altogether the MoD answered 280 journalists’ and
citizens' questions.

The MoD informed the wider public of the divestment of uneconomic resources (motor vehicles,
PC-9 aircraft) and public tenders for the purchase of new equipment and armaments (UAV,
battle uniforms), and about the activities of the MoD's leadership to encourage the inclusion of
Slovenian companies from the defence and security fields in the EU and NATO markets, to
which end the MoD published a catalogue of the capabilities of Slovenian companies. Together
with the activities for the promotion of the soldier profession, the MoD notified the public of
employment in the SAF, stressing the importance of providing the appropriate level of security.

Special attention was paid to informing of the public about the MoD's leadership endeavours to
strengthen cooperation with the local population in areas where the SAF is present. In the
context of the special Coordination Group for the implementation of the arrangement between
the MoD and the Postojna municipality on the harmonization of interests concerning the use
and the management of military infrastructure in the area of the Postojna municipality, the MoD
organized two press conferences in 2015. The public was notified of the use of the mobile
military hospital Role 2 in Jesenice, which fully replaced the hospital's emergency department
until a new one was completed in the middle of December 2015. The MoD's leadership also
presented its intention to establish a regional rescue centre in Murska Sobota.

The news on the use of the Falcon airplane for transportation of human organs for
transplantation, which helped save a number of human lives, was well covered by the media.

In the field of protection and rescue, the MoD presented the SAF's modular capability to the
public at the Civil Protection Day. The capability presented is intended for the SAF's
participation in protection, rescue and relief activities. The MoD also presented the regular
national assessment of the level of qualification of the CP and Red Cross first aid teams, the
renovated meteorological station on Kredarica Peak and the new protection and rescue station,
and a helipad in Bovec. A large proportion of the communication activities referred to
international activities intended for the strengthening of bilateral cooperation, integration at the
regional level, and the provision of developmental assistance to the Western Balkan countries
and the RS's active role in the EU CP Mechanism.

The MoD informed the public of its activities carried out in the context of the EU and NATO,
including regional and bilateral activities, on a regular basis. The public was also regularly

71/115


-----

informed of the SAF members' and the MoD employees' participation in international operations
and missions.

The MoD prepared 73 draft speeches for different events and ceremonies and eight editorials
for a number of different publications.

**Review of Website Posts in 2015**

In 2015, an average of 1.6 press releases per day were published on the MoD and SAF
websites (www.mo.gov.si and www.slovenskavojska.si), or a total of 585 releases. The releases
were accompanied by more than 2,800 photographs and 121 sound recordings, which is similar
to the average of recent years. New content (provisions) was added to the IRSPANOD's pages
on the MoD's website. MoD organized two training courses on the management of its websites.

In comparison to 2014, the activities on social network decreased. This year, the MoD's main
focus was on Twitter.

**The Realization of Filming and Publishing Activities**

With regard to periodic publications, 12 issues of the Slovenian Armed Forces Magazine, two
issues of Contemporary Military Challenges, and the 29th issue of the Ujma Magazine were
issued. The ninth issue of the Collection of Military Education Papers was published after a
more than three-year break.

In the administrative part of the MoD and ACPDR, more than 90% of the publishing activity was
realized, in reference to the adopted plan. In the SAF General Staff, the production of
professional military and other literature was lower. Moreover, the majority of publications were
published as e-books.

Proof-reading activity encompassed the proof-reading and the editing of professional military
and other literature. In addition to the latter, a large number of official texts were also proof-read
for the MoD's administration, the SAF General Staff and the ACPDR. Also, a number of internal
training courses were carried out. A total of 8,706 pages were proof-read; 3,200 of them for the
needs of the SAF General Staff.

New Rules on Publishing and Filming Activities at the MOD were prepared. The Rules entered
into effect on 21st November 2015 and are one of the foundations of the attainment of the set
goals (the unification of publishing procedures and tasks at the MoD and greater economy in
the drafting of annual plans for professional military and other literature).

In the area of video production, the MoD documented all important events, SAF exercises and
soldier training (Moste, Bloška polica, Novo mesto). In November the MoD filmed on the border
with Croatia, and in December the SAF Sportsman of the Year event, and also assisted the
Public Relations Department at the SAF General Staff in conducting camera training. The MoD
filmed in Kosovo for different media companies and provided support to the Office of the
President of the RS (up to twice a month).

On the MoD's YouTube channel, 70 short videos were published, which were also available to
media companies for the preparation of informational material.

On the Postani vojak (Become a Soldier) website, the MoD regularly published current news on
employment in the SAF, the voluntary military service and the contract military service in the
reserve SAF component, as well as interesting articles about life and work in the SAF units.
During seven years of operation of the Postani vojak website, a total of 885,016 visits were
identified, with more than 480,000 different visitors opening 4,750,807 pages. On average, the
visitors viewed 5.37 pages and stayed on a single page for an enviable 4.9 minutes.
Appearance on social networks is a reality of online communication, which is why the MoD
expanded its activity on the social networks Facebook, where it already has 11,200 followers,

72/115


-----

and YouTube, where it published more than 300 films viewed by more than 430,000 different
visitors.

_Visits to the Postani vojak website between 2009 and 2015_

**9.2 Cooperation with civil society organizations**

In 2015, the MoD took over the co-financing of the war veterans’ societies and associations
from the budget funds. The basis for this was the Rules adopted at the end of 2014, which
included criteria to this end. In 2015, thirteen societies or associations submitted a tender in
response to a public invitation to tender for co-financing. Only nine of them met all the
requirements. Their applications were assessed and contracts signed with associations. The
resources were distributed in two separate payments. The MoD prepared two workshops, at
which the Minister informed the participants of the MoD's essential tasks.

In the autumn of 2015, certain minor modifications were made to the Rules and the criteria in
line with the experience gained and the individual statutory amendments (Rules on the Criteria
for Co-financing War Veterans’ Societies or Associations, Official Gazette of the RS, Nos. 5/15
and 89/15). In December, the invitation to tender for 2016 was published. Altogether ten
societies and associations applied, of which nine met all the requirements.

In accordance with the criteria, the new applicants were granted the status of a society
operating in the public interest in the field of defence or war veterans.

### 10 NORMATIVE ACTS

In accordance with the RS Government Work Programme for 2015 (RS Government Decision,
No. 00404-1/2014/64, dated 22nd January 2015 and No. 00404-1/2014/109, dated 12th June
2015) the adoption of three statutory provisions and 20 implementing regulations from the
competence of the MoD was planned (10 within the competence of the Government of the RS
and 10 within the MoD's competence). Eight implementing regulations and one amendment to
the Act was adopted and published in the Official Gazette of the RS. During this period, the
MoD prepared 10 implementing regulations which, however, were not included in the RS
Government Work Programme for 2015, as the need for their adoption only arose in the course
of the year. Concerning the RS Government Work Programme, only three statutory provisions
and twelve implementing regulations had not been implemented. However, this did not have a
negative impact on the legal regulation of areas that were governed by them. Taking into
account the fact that these objectives will be mainly realized in 2016, no special corrective
measures are required to this end. Taking into account the current migration crisis, an
amendment of the Defence Act was adopted in 2015.

The normative field centred on the further harmonization of implementing regulations with legal
innovations, that is in the working area of the MoD as well as other ministerial areas. To a lesser
extent, changes were related to the introduction of the European legal order into the legal order
of the Republic of Slovenia.

The new Rules on Protection Against Unexploded Explosive ordnance* did not affect the
concept of protection against UXO, but did influence the arrangement of procedures and the
manner of work, including security and other measures in the event of the finding, protection,
detection, identification, removal, transportation and destruction of unexploded explosive
ordnance.

Due to the transfer of responsibility in the field of operation and co-financing of the war veterans’
associations from the Ministry of Labour, Family, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities to the
Ministry of Defence, the introduction of the Rules on Determining the Criteria for Societies in
Demonstrating Major Achievements in the Functioning of the Societies in Order to Be Granted
the Status of a Society Operating in the Public Interest in the Field of War Veterans, helped
define the criteria specifically for associations in demonstrating major achievements in the
functioning of societies or associations in the field of war veterans operating in the public
interest. The Rules on the Criteria for the Co-Financing of Activities of the War Veterans’
Associations or Societies defined the criteria and the procedure for the co-financing of activities
carried out by those war veteran associations or societies which, in accordance with the
regulations on war veterans and the regulations on societies, hold the status of a society
operating in the public interest in the field of war veterans. In 2015, the amendment of the Rules
was adopted (Rules on the Criteria for Co-Financing of the Activities of Societies or
Associations of War Veterans). The amendment extended the activities which may be cofinanced and changed certain conditions for the granting of points. The introduction of a special
warning signal in the event of the imminent threat of a chlorine accident* and a special warning
signal in the event of imminent threat of a flood wave resulting from the overflow or collapse of a
hydroelectric dam* partly changed the areas of use of the special warning signal.

The Decree amending the Regulation on Production Consents and Trade Permits for Military
Weapons and Equipment, and on Preliminary Permits for Import, Export, Transit and Transfer of
Defence Products was adopted for the purposes of ensuring the introduction of an updated list
of defence products into the Slovenian legal order (in accordance with the amendment of the
Commission Directive 2014/108/EU of 12th December 2014 Amending Directive 2009/43/EC of
the European Parliament and of the Council as Regards the List of Defence-Related Products
(Official Gazette of the RS, No. 359, dated 16th December 2014, p. 117)). Rules on the
Amendments of Awards of the Ministry of Defence refer to the provision of procedures for the
bestowal and handover of firearms in accordance with the provisions of the Firearms Act and
the provisions on the bestowal of an individual award. A Decree amending the Decree on Ranks
and Promotion in the Slovenian Armed Forces was prepared for purposes of greater

74/115


-----

transparency of the hierarchical arrangement and a more appropriate management of the SAF
personnel. A Decree amending the Decree on Airspace Surveillance Arrangements was
adopted for purposes of adjustment and coordination of this arrangement with defence and joint
allied plans and with the new legislation adopted in the field of aviation and with the SAF’s
reorganization. Moreover, the Decree also provided a clearer definition of individual activities
carried out by competent services and bodies during air surveillance. The Rules amending the
Rules on Military Personnel Assessment introduce changes to the evaluation of performance of
service members who also work as the authorized personnel of the representative trade unions,
and carry out their trade union related assignments during full working time. Due to the
reduction in municipal costs and the expenses of other entities liable for the construction of
shelters, the Decree on the Construction and Maintenance of Shelters* changes the criteria for
the arrangement of the urban and other areas, where basic protection shelters should be built in
all new constructions. The Rules amending the Rules on Minimum Technical and Other
Conditions for the Maintenance of Manual and Mobile Fire Extinguishers* includes modifications
in the area of maintenance of fire extinguishers, and in particular, arranges the manner of
maintenance of fire extinguishers upon closure of an economic entity which had produced a
certain type of fire extinguishers. The Decree amending the Decree on Military Specialists was
adopted in reference to the Decree amending the Decree on Ranks and Promotion in the SAF
for the purposes of harmonization of criteria for the promotion of military specialists in grades
with the criteria for the promotion of military personnel in ranks. The new Rules on Possession
and Carrying of Weapons and Ammunition in the Intelligence and Security Service of the MoD
regulated specific questions regarding the possession and carrying of weapons and
ammunitions by the employees of the Intelligence and Security Service of the MoD and the
powers of its Director General in detail. The Rules amending the Rules on Inspection
Procedures in the Field of Defence refer mainly to the need for the harmonization of the rules in
force with the Inspection Act, the General Administrative Procedure Act and some other
regulations. The Decree amending the Decree Determining the Compensation Fee for the Use
of Inventory Means changes the criteria for the calculation of compensation for the use of real
estate due to the changed regulations in the field of real estate assessment. Due to the migrant
crisis, an Act amending the Defence Act was adopted. The amended act allows for the
possibility that, based on Government's proposal and an absolute majority, the National
Assembly decides that those SAF members, who cooperate with the police in the wider
protection of the national border, also exercise certain powers defined by the Police Tasks and
Powers Act. A Decree Amending the Decree on Salaries and other Remuneration of Service
Members of the Slovenian Armed Forces Fulfilling Obligations Assumed in International
Organizations or through International Agreements is a consequence of an agreement
concluded with the representative trade unions of the public sector. With its adoption, the
validity of reduced nominal bases for the determination of salary received for performing military
service abroad extends until 31st July 2016.

### 11 RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGICAL PROJECTS

In spite of a relatively challenging public finances situation and a realistic scope of assets
available for research and development in the wider defence field, the MoD reintroduced the
implementation of some developmental projects in 2015.

Initially, research and development projects in support of civil and military capabilities were dual
use projects, in which the MoD looked for connections with other national and international
research and development programmes and projects.

The primary fields of research and development in support of civilian capabilities were the areas
of flood safety, earthquake safety and the protection of the population against landslides, due to
the increase in the operation of protection, rescue and relief capabilities for the population in the
event of natural and other disasters. The results of this project will contribute to more effective
responses by the services providing security in this field to the population.

Development in support of military capabilities was oriented towards the increase in mountain
warfare capabilities. The result of this project will, in the context of the NATO Centre of
Excellence for Mountain Warfare, contribute to the reputation of the SAF and the RS.

In the context of international defence and military research, the MoD actively participated in a
number of research groups of the NATO's Organization for Science and Technology, together
with the MoD's experts and other experts from domestic and foreign research organizations:
terahertz technologies for detection of concealed explosives; the development of man-portable
technologies for purposes of warrior equipment; speech and language processing for translating
purposes in NATO operations; analyses for the prediction of cyber threats; an investigation into
suicides in the armed forces; the development of detection methods for the detection of
zoonosis-causing agents; the study of solutions for relieving the burden of soldiers; the
influence of military life on children in military families; and operational analyses in support of
NATO's operations in the field of technological improvement of training in the urban
environment.

At the European Defence Agency, the MoD monitored the work of the group for the integration
of the Remotely-Piloted Air Systems into air traffic.

With its participation in these international groups, the MoD contributed to the development of
the SAF’s capabilities and to the development of joint capabilities within the Alliance, and
supported national development and technological entities.

## IMPLEMENTATION OF RESOURCE PLANS

### 1 IMPLEMENTATION OF THE FINANCIAL PLAN 

In 2015, the MoD spent EUR 343.9 million on the accomplishment of its tasks, which makes up
96.7% of the applicable financial plan and 101.6% of the supplementary financial plan.

The financial plan for 2015 had already been adopted in 2013. In 2015, the MoD adopted the
supplementary financial plan, which was EUR 6.3 million higher than the previously adopted
financial plan. The increase was a consequence of higher planned dedicated revenues, new
transfers and new EU projects. In the area of protection against natural and other disasters, the
MoD was allocated non-refundable funds from the EU Solidarity Fund, which the RS was
entitled to in 2015 and 2016 following the 2014 winter disaster. The resources were paid to the
operators mitigating the consequences of natural disasters. The MoD also committed to cofinancing the activities of societies and associations of veterans, which was in the competence
of the Ministry of Labour, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities up to 2015. The MoD
participated in the absorption of funds from the Internal Security Fund (OSF) in the period 20142020 for the first time as the manager of the crisis management and the protection of the critical
infrastructure fields. The financing is carried out in the following ratio: 75:25.

On 31 December 2015, the applicable financial plan amounted to EUR 355,644,593, which is
EUR 17.2 million higher than the supplementary financial plan. Of this, the integral funds
increased by EUR 4.1 and the appropriations by EUR 13.1, since their value was being
assessed during the planning. The increase in integral funds was a consequence of additional
resources received by the MoD based on the RS Government's Decision to refund the
expenses incurred during the performance of tasks related to the provision of accommodation
and care for the migrants (EUR 3.8 million), and based on the Government's decision regarding
Slovenia's participation in the EU operation in the southern part of the Mediterranean, the
EUNAVFOR MED operation Sophia.

The financial plan realization, in the amount of EUR 343,938,756, represents 3.5% of the
national budget and 0.9% of GDP, which is the lowest percentage in recent years. In
comparison to the applicable financial plan, the realization of integral funds was 100%. The
realization of appropriations was 58.1%, chiefly as a result of state property management, for
which the largest amount of unapplied funds will be transferred to the next year. The MoD
integral funds represent 95.4%, appropriations 4.6% and the EU projects 0.04% of the financial
plan’s realization.

The difference between the applicable financial plan and the realization is the uncommitted
EUR 11.7 million: EUR 100,615 in integral funds and EUR 11.4 million in appropriations, most
of which will be transferred to the 2016 budget year.

In comparison to the 2014 realization, the realization in 2015 was EUR 4 million higher, while
the index was at 101.2. The realization of integral funds indicates an increase of EUR 2.6
million; investments increased by EUR 1.4 million, EUR 3.9 million went on current expenditure,
while salaries decreased by EUR 2.7 million. The increase in the current expenditure was a
consequence of new transfers taken over by the MoD in 2015 (EU Solidarity Fund, veteran
societies and associations). The realization of appropriations was higher by EUR 1.3 million.

In the spending structure, the portion for salaries decreased by 1.6 percentage points. The
portion of current expenditure increased by 0.9 percentage points and the investment portion by
0.4 percentage points.

Salaries, in the amount of EUR 236.3 million, represent 68.7% of the total MoD expenditure. In
recent years, the portion designated for salaries has been growing, mainly due to lower
investments. However, in nominal terms, staff salaries have been decreasing. In comparison to
2014, however, the portion designated for salaries in the MoD's spending structure decreased,
mainly on account of higher transfers. Since 2010, the MoD has been reducing labour costs by
not replacing leavers and by recognizing allowances and reimbursements only on a very
rational basis. In comparison with the previous year, salaries in 2015 were lower by EUR 2.7
million, while in comparison with 2009, when they were at their highest, salaries were lower by
EUR 55.9 million.

Current expenditure amounts to EUR 74.8 million, which represents 21.7% of total spending.
Out this, 16.7 million of current transfers, including international commitments, the EU Solidarity
Fund, co-financing of societies for veterans, and co-financing of firefighting units, societies and
NGOs which form part of the operational protection rescue and relief structure. Due to the aging
of equipment, maintenance costs are increasing; fixed operating costs also represent a large
proportion of expenditures.

Investment expenditure stood at EUR 16.9 million, accounting for 4.9% of the total MoD
expenditure. Due to reductions in the MoD's financial resources, the number of investments
strongly decreased after 2010, especially in comparison to 2010 when it exceeded 20%.

The dynamics of individual categories of MoD expenditures in the period between 2006 and
2015 is depicted in the line chart below.

**Overview of the Realization by Programme Structure**

The year 2015 saw the implementation of the financial plan in line with programme planning.
The financial plan was implemented through two policies, four programmes, 12 subprogrammes and 69 measures or projects. The MoD's fundamental policy is 07 Defence and
Protection, and three programmes: Defence System and Crisis Management, Military Defence
and Protection against Natural and Other Disasters. In 2015, the MoD took over a new policy,
18 Culture and the Civil Society, and a new programme, Support to Non Governmental
Organizations and Civil Society (co-financing of activities carried out by associations and
societies for veterans) from the Ministry of Labour, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.

defence expenditure reduced by EUR 5.2 million, while pensions only reduced by EUR 5.4
million.

Defence system resources (the financial plan of the SAF, the MoD's and the DIRS's
administration) represented 84% of defence expenditure. The remaining 16% was represented
by military pensions, while the resources of the Office for the Protection of Classified
Information barely reached EUR 0.5 million.

### 2 PERSONNEL PLAN IMPLEMENTATION

**2.1 Personnel Plan Implementation in the Administrative Part of the MoD**

The Joint Personnel Plan of the RS Government specified that the permitted number of
employees in the administrative part of the MoD, as of 31st December 2015, was 1,124 public
employees. In line with the Rules on the Contents and Procedures of Preparation and
Submission of Staff Plans, the permitted number of employees excludes:
1. Full-time employment with reduced working hours to compensate for phased or disability

retirement of government officials.

2. Temporary employment for the replacement of temporarily absent public employees whose

salary compensation is not provided by the MoD in the event of (a) maternity and childcare
leave, (b) sick leave of over 30 working days, and (c) parental leave.

The administrative part of the MoD adheres to the guidelines of the RS Government on a
gradual reduction in the number of employees on the basis of natural attrition. The table and
chart below show how the permitted number of employees decreased between 2010 and 2015.
In the given period, the permitted number of employees had to be reduced by 186 public
employees, which is 86% of the Personnel Plan for 2010. In six years, the permitted number of
employees was reduced by 14%, an average of 2.8% per year.

In 2015, the MoD achieved the goal again, since the permitted number of employees as of 31st
December 2015 did not exceed the permitted number specified in the Decision of the RS
Government no. 10002-3/2015/33, dated 26th February 2015, and the subsequently adopted
changes. The actual number is 1 employee less than the permitted number. The goal was
reached despite a 3% reduction in the permitted number of employees.

The table below shows the reduction in the actual number of employees based on the
Personnel Plan. It is clearly evident that the actual number of employees was reduced by 1%.

The permitted number of employees in 2015 was reached because, at the end of 2014, there
were 24 public employees fewer than the permitted number in the 2014 Personnel Plan. In
2015, the administrative part of the MoD employed 19 public employees and 259 public works
participants who are excluded from the Personnel Plan. The employment relationship was
terminated by 53 public employees, 4 of whom had performed public works. The largest share
of the employment relationship termination is represented by the retirement of public
employees, amounting to 57% or 30 public employees. There were also many transitions
between the MoD bodies in 2015: 36 public employees transferred to the administrative part of
the MoD and 10 public employees left the administrative part of the MoD.

**2.2 Personnel Plan Implementation in the SAF**

**2.2.1 Active Component**

The medium-term planning documents provided for 7,600 members of the SAF active
component in 2015. The Joint Personnel Plan for State Administration Bodies for 2015 provided
for 7,254 SAF active component members. On 31st December 2015, the SAF numbered 7,055
members, meaning that the size of the SAF provided for in the medium-term planning
documents reached 92.8%, and the Personnel Plan 97.3%. The structure of employees on 31st
December 2015 was as follows: 1,060 officers, 1,961 NCOs, 3,017 soldiers, 246 senior military
specialists, 322 junior military specialists and 449 civilians.

In 2015, 381 members left the SAF (54 officers, 67 NCOs, 213 soldiers, 25 military specialists
and 22 civilians), which is more than in 2014 (312), 2013 (292), 2012 (265) and 2011 (281). The
Personnel Plan was thus not fully realized. Reasons for the failure to achieve the planned
number of employed members are a reduced interest in employment with the SAF, a large
number of members being eligible for retirement, termination of employment contracts, and a
higher occurrence of consensual terminations of employment contracts.

Civilian Personnel 441 449 +8

**Total** **7,176** **7,055** **-121**

Owing to the reduction in the permitted number of SAF employees and the fact that it is mostly
soldiers leaving the armed forces, who cannot be fully replaced, the SAF could not achieve the
target ratio between officers, NCOs and soldiers. The SAF's strategic objective is to achieve
structural balance between officers, NCOs and soldiers in the ratio of 1:2:5. The active
component ratio in 2015 is similar to 2014, namely 1:1.9:2.8.

From 2006 to 2015, the average age of SAF members increased from 35.5 in 2006 to 39.8 in
2015.

The personnel plan realization was 97.3%. In 2015, 728 candidates applied for employment in
the SAF, and 265 of them were employed following the selection process. Despite the efforts of
competent authorities and the high level of unemployment in Slovenia, it seems that the
requirements and complexity of the military profession, together with the level of salary for
soldiers, discourage potential candidates from employment in the SAF.

**2.2.2 Employment in the SAF**

In 2015, 732 candidates applied for employment in the SAF. Based on the selection
procedures, 265 candidates were employed. The structure of new employments in 2015 was as
follows: 16 officer candidates, 2 NCOs, 207 soldiers, 28 civilians and 12 military specialists.

Despite the efforts of competent authorities and the high level of unemployment in Slovenia, it
seems that the requirements and complexity of the military profession, together with the level of
salary for soldiers, discourage potential candidates from employment in the SAF.

**2.2.3 Military Service in the SAF Contract Reserve**

The SAF Personnel Plan for 2015 and 2016 stipulated that the number of contract reserve
members should remain in the framework of 818 members. The completed guidelines of the
Medium-Term Defence Programme 2015-2020 defined the scope of the contract reserve to be
up to 820 members by 31st December 2015. Subsequently, in the autumn, due to the migrant
crisis, the need arose to increase the size of the contract reserve component, which was later
realized through the Minister's guidelines on the acquisition of 1,500 contract reserve members
in 2016. The MoD checked the interest in contract conclusion with former professional members
who had left the SAF at their own accord, former contract reserve members whose contracts
were not renewed due to budget cuts, and the citizens who have successfully completed
voluntary military service and acquired a Military Occupational Specialty (MOS) in infantry. In
November 2015, an information letter on this was addressed to a total of 1,758 candidates.

On 31st December 2015, the SAF contract reserve numbered 860 members, of whom 25 were
officers, 52 NCOs, 744 soldiers and 39 military specialists.

According to the primary personnel plans and reduced financial resources, contracts with
contract reserve members in 2015 were renewed selectively, for a period of two years, and
excluded a long service bonus. During the period concerned, 425 members signed the annexes
on the extension of the contractual relationship. A decision on the termination of the contract
was issued to 434 members, with the termination of records completed for 281 former
members.

-----

At the end of 2015, the records included 450 candidates who met the formal requirements for
the conclusion of contracts on military service in the contract reserve component (64.8% less
than in 2014, which is the result of the conclusion of applications depending on the needs of the
SAF for contract reserve members, the age of candidates, the time of application submission,
and the fact that in 2014, the conclusion of new contracts was not possible).

The application for inclusion in the contract reserve component was submitted by 211
candidates.

**2.2.4 Voluntary Military Service**

In 2015, 190 candidates applied for voluntary military service, 26 of whom were women. Due to
non-compliance with general (cancellation of the application before signing the contract,
reservations based on criminal records, reservations of the Intelligence and Security Service)
and health conditions, only 65 male and 9 female candidates of these were assigned to
voluntary military service.

_Conclusion of voluntary military service for the 59[th] generation_

From 2004, a total of 2,546 candidates (of whom 309 were women) have been assigned to
voluntary military service. Of these, 1,799 completed the service successfully. So far, the SAF
has employed 744 former volunteer soldiers. In 2015, the SAF employed 40 former members of
the voluntary service who, in recent years, have successfully completed their voluntary military
service.

**2.2.5 Promotion of Employment and Service in the SAF**

In 2015, in accordance with the provisions of the Military Service Act, 9,422 young men born in
1997 were invited to a briefing session for national service personnel. After the candidates'
entry in the military records, the administrative body competent for defence acquaints these
young men with their obligations and rights (in the same calendar year as the candidates reach
the age of 18). Of the candidates invited, 76.9% attended the briefing session, while the rest
were subsequently informed by mail. The SAF organized and carried out over 200 promotional
events. The attendees were presented with employment opportunities in the SAF, military
service in the contract reserve, voluntary military service, and the possibilities for the award of
scholarships for SAF employment. Promotion of military profession was mostly carried out on
the website www.postanivojak.si.

_Familiarization with military duties is an excellent opportunity to showcase military professions_

_to young people._

**2.2.6 Scholarships for Work in the SAF**

In 2015, five contracts for SAF scholarships were concluded for the academic year 2014/2015.
A call for applications for the award of five scholarships for the academic year 2015/2016 was
published in June 2015. Only four scholarships will, however, be granted, as the only candidate
for Bachelor of Nautical Science failed to pass all the selection procedures.

_From a number of candidates, only the best receive scholarships._

**2.2.7 Preparation of Personnel for Departure from Military Service**

An information day was organized in March for SAF members who earned the right to
retirement in 2015, at which representatives of the Defence Affairs Directorate, the Joint
Personnel Division at the SAF General Staff, and the companies Kapitalska družba and Modra
zavarovalnica presented the formalities to be carried out at retirement, as well as the absorption
of funds from the latter two companies. In June, a pre-retirement seminar was organized at
which experts in gerontology, healthy diet, addiction etc. presented the perils and opportunities
of the third life period to the participants, and gave them advice on how to make a successful
transition to this period of their lives in the best way possible. Eight soldiers lost their
employment contracts due to reaching 45 years of age. Six soldiers were granted the right to
transfer to a suitable working position within the Ministry, and two soldiers rejected the offered
redeployment.

_Each year, the MoD presents itself at the Third Age Festival at the Cankarjev dom hall in_

_Ljubljana._

**2.2.8 Care of Former SAF Members**

The Intergenerational Information and Social Centres (MIDS) at Ajdovščina and Slovenska
Bistrica organized 142 events which were attended by about 3,000 people. The events included
everything from regular recreation, lectures, and thematic and art workshops, to hikes,
excursions and multi-day camps. Currently, the MIDS has 239 members, and the MoD
voluntary intergenerational society for quality aging has 140 members. The latter organized an
annual meeting which was attended by 120 members, and an annual military expert excursion
which was attended by 46 members.

### 3 IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PLAN FOR THE ACQUISITION OF THE STATE’S PHYSICAL ASSETS

In 2015, EUR 3,554,847 was spent under the heading of infrastructure and equipment. Of this
amount, EUR 564,308 was spent on infrastructure and EUR 2,307,377 on the main equipment
and modernization. Cerklje ob Krki Airfield saw the completion of works on the meteorological
information system, visual navigation, extension of the runway, and associated systems. All
these are currently being introduced into operational use.

The project of investment maintenance of military infrastructure has been allocated EUR
146,461, which signifies a 38.9% realization compared to the baseline funding level. The
decrease is mainly the result of the redeployment of funds for other budget headings and for
routine military infrastructure maintenance.

The adaptation of infrastructure received EUR 189,796 (Building 4 at the Baron Andrej Čehovin
(BAČ) Barracks in Postojna, and the Centre of Excellence for Mountain Warfare in Poljče),
signifying a 44.2% realization compared to the baseline funding level. The decrease is mainly
the result of delays in the reconstruction of Building 4 at the BAČ Barracks in Postojna. The
establishment of technical security in the SAF's facilities received EUR 374,512, which signifies
an 89% realization of the planned funds. A total of EUR 378,085 was allocated to co-finance the
local infrastructure.

_Funds for the maintenance of military infrastructure (investments are not liquid)_

The reduction in funding for the provision of military infrastructure leads to increasing difficulties
in ensuring proper conditions for the SAF's operation.

A total of EUR 2,915,795 was allocated to the purchase of SAF uniforms. Most of the funds
were used for the purchase of combat uniform items, and a smaller portion of the funds for
service uniform items. The available resources could not provide for the planned equipping of
SAF members in accordance with the criteria of belonging. Almost half of the protective
equipment pieces of the 21[st] Century Warrior had expired their shelf life, with only 38% being
replaced.

93/115


-----

A total of EUR 1,397,666 was allocated to the purchase of equipment for operational
functioning. The above stated funding only provided the most essential equipment for the
operation of SAF members in the IOM, protection and safety at work, equipment for the
operation of kitchen installations, and additional equipment required by SAF members to assist
the Ministry of the Interior in protecting the external borders at the time of the migrant crisis.

The failure to provide sufficient funds for uniforms and operational equipment will lead to further
deterioration in this area in the future. Not only will SAF members lack proper uniforms and
protective operational equipment, but the provision of statutory equipment for the protection and
safety at work, and equipment for the regular operation of the SAF's logistics units, will also be
questionable.

A total of EUR 1,000,000 was planned for investment maintenance in material resources, of
which EUR 698,719 was spent. Of this amount, 41% was used for CBR defence resources,
29% for software upgrades, 26% for the upgrade of the multi-purpose boat Triglav, and 2% for
the upgrade of aircraft and vehicles. Thirty percent were reallocated for the provision of SAF
salaries.

A total of EUR 15,435,744 were allocated to the routine maintenance of material resources. The
realization was 86%. Fourteen percent of the funding was reallocated for the purpose of SAF
salaries (EUR 2,286,434). Payment for activities implemented in 2015 thus needed to be
transferred to 2016. The proportion of outsourced maintenance work is increasing due to the
lack of staff. Financial resources for the maintenance of material resources are substantially
reduced compared to 2010, namely by 52%, although the number of material resources has
remained unchanged.

_Purchases of Equipment and Maintenance Between 2010 and 2015_

The graph shows the euro financial value of equipping the SAF with the main equipment,
uniforms, and operational equipment, of ammunition procurement, and of investment and
routine maintenance of material resources and infrastructure. The reduction of funds continues.

**3.1 Real Estate**

Based on the plan for the acquisition of real estate of the state and self-governing local
communities for 2015, the MoD has acquired the following state property:

  - Direct contract, no. 478-327/2013-22, dated 17th June 2015, land, plot no. 2800/1,
cadastral municipality 2405 Podnanos: EUR 9,150.

  - Exchange contract with the Municipality of Pivka, no. 478-73/2015-6, dated 17th June
2015; acquisition of land with ID codes 2498-3650/5-0 and 2498-3650/8-0: EUR
4,447.80.

  - Direct contract, no. 478-402/2011-37, dated 7th December 2015, building, plot nos.
3420/2 and 3420/3, cadastral municipality of Cerklje: EUR 147,704.44.

  - Contract for the attainment of public benefit, no. 478-80/2011-23, dated 12th March
2015, acquisition of land with plot no. 2267/7, cadastral municipality 1778 - Volavlje (ID
4014904): EUR 518.

  - Contract for the attainment of public benefit, no. 478-60/2015-2, dated 17th June 2015,
acquisition of land with plot no. 2286/12, cadastral municipality 1778 - Volavlje (ID
1688191): EUR 3,100.

  - Contract for the attainment of public benefit, no. 478-80/2011-22, dated 12th March
2015, acquisition of land with plot no. 2286/11, cadastral municipality 1778 - Volavlje
(ID 749671), and plot no. 2284/7, cadastral municipality 1778 - Volavlje (ID 3772677),
all within the military real estate Telecommunication Facility Janče: EUR 1,750.

One plot is in the process of redemption for the extension of the airport runway and the
construction of an alternative road between Drnovo and Zasap (phases I and II); currently,
procedures for the elimination of registered mortgages on real estate are underway.

**3.2 Procurement**

In 2015, the MoD conducted 228 public procurement procedures in accordance with the
provisions of the Public Procurement Act and the Public Procurement for Defence and Security
Act. Based on the conducted procedures, 308 contracts were concluded, with the total value of
EUR 72.317 million including VAT.

Most of the value – EUR 57.383 million – relates to the conclusion of long-term contracts (from
three to a maximum of five years). Such contracts were concluded for goods and services to
ensure the regular operation and permanent readiness of the SAF and the protection and
rescue system in the performance of their statutory functions, providing maintenance services
and a supply of spare parts for SAF aircraft, watercraft and equipment, and in all other areas
where the MoD needs valid contracts for its activities. Based on the Government decision on
joint public procurements for 2015, carried out by the Ministry of Public Administration, the MoD,
on the basis of concluded framework agreements, concluded direct contracts for the supply of
fuels and natural gas, and the purchase of plane tickets.

In the purchase of equipment and goods for the needs of the SAF, larger orders were made for
the purchase of combat uniform items, ammunition, and personal and multi-purpose vehicles. In
the field of construction, a contract was concluded for the reconstruction of a building at the
Postojna Barracks.

In order to achieve the capabilities of Cerklje ob Krki Airfield, a contract was concluded to
construct a fuel farm with a transfer area and a control system, and a contract for the
construction of a hangar with platforms and a road.

In the area of protection and rescue, a major purchase of pagers and radio stations was
implemented, as well as several urgent orders at the time of the migrant situation.

**3.3 Acquisitions**

In 2015, 467 quality control procedures for goods and services were carried out. The total value
of acquisitions in 2015 amounted to EUR 17.54 million, which is 63.3% more than in 2014, while
the number of acquisitions increased by 41.5%. This data indicates an increased activity in the
implementation of quality control of contract subjects and thus an increased reliability of the
supply of quality goods and services to users. In the area of mutual recognition of the
Government quality assurance, in accordance with STANAG 4107, four procedures were
carried out.

### 4 IMPLEMENTATION OF THE REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE PLAN FOR THE SALE OF STATE-OWNED TANGIBLE ASSETS 

**4.1 Real Estate**

The Annual Management Plan for 2015 includes real estate which the MoD does not need for
its activities, regardless of whether or not it is registered in the Land Register. The MoD is
intensively implementing procedures for the development and acquisition of the appropriate
documents for registration of real estate in the Land Register, including land allotment
procedures. Common obstacles to the sale are judicial proceedings, denationalization and the
problem of unsettled ownership of the land on which the MoD facilities are situated.

In 2015, the sale of apartments and garages contributed to the increase in revenue from the
sale of real estate. Based on the Annual Tangible Assets Management Plan, the MoD
conducted ten public real estate auctions, while three garages, eight apartments and seven
pieces of land were sold through direct contracts. Altogether, 82 apartments, 11 garages, 30
pieces of land and 15 facilities were sold at a total value of EUR 4,328,787. Of these, 8
apartments, 3 garages and 10 pieces of land were sold through direct sale.

Five apartments, two garages and a facility with land were sold for other state bodies at a total
value of EUR 241,030.

**4.2. Movable property**

The Ordinance on the State-Owned Tangible Assets Management Plan Intended for State
Bodies, Judicial Bodies, Public Institutes, Public Utility Institutes, Public Agencies and Public
Funds for 2015, of which the State-Owned Movable Property Management Plan for 2015 is a
constituent part, included a Dassault Falcon 2000EX aircraft, two AN/TPS-70 radar stations, two
Pilatus aircraft, eighteen 105 mm howitzers, a Roland air defence missile system, a BRDM-2
reconnaissance armoured vehicle, a ZKB-1V armoured personnel carrier, thirty-nine BVP M80A
infantry fighting vehicles, ten M-84 tanks, thirty T-55S tanks, and a bus. The most favourable
bidder, i.e. the Republic of Serbia, has been selected for the radar stations with their spare parts
and equipment. After obtaining proper documents (EUC), a sales agreement will be concluded
in the amount of EUR 1,600,000.

The MoD has sold movable property which was not included in the Annual Movable Property
Management Plan, as the individual value of movable property did not amount to EUR
10,000.00. Thus, in 2015, 154 motor vehicles at a total value of EUR 135,810 were sold in two
public auctions (January, June), and 46,629 pieces of infantry weapons at a total value of EUR
3,782,184 in two public auctions (February, May). Non-organic SAF equipment at a value of
EUR 46,000, two KrAZ bridging vehicles at a value of EUR 7,210, and two Pilatus aircraft at a
value of EUR 1,300,000 were sold by a direct contract. Altogether, movable property at a value
of EUR 5,135,394 was sold in 2015.

In accordance with the lease agreement, a Cobra 4x4 light reconnaissance vehicle with built-in
nuclear, radiological, chemical and biological equipment was leased to the company
EM.TRONIC for the period 1st July 2015 to 5th October 2015 in the amount of EUR 1,000
excluding VAT.

Movable property was transferred free of charge to individual societies, self-governing local
communities, public institutes and individuals, if they fulfilled the necessary legal requirements
(16 transfers). Applications of societies, self-governing local communities, public institutes and
individuals were resolved negatively if they did not fulfill the necessary legal requirements.

### 5 IMPLEMENTATION OF THE EDUCATION, TRAINING AND ADVANCED TRAINING PLAN

In 2015, the Education, Training and Advanced Training Plan for 2015 was not adopted.
Therefore, the plan realization has been compared to the proposal. Realization in the
administrative part of the MoD:

  - 22% in the field of functional external training (reasons: streamlining of financial
resources, work overload, personal reasons, cancellation of certain forms of training).

  - 27% in the field of language training (reasons: capacity of the School of Foreign
Languages – one spot available for the administrative part of the MoD in a particular
language course, certain forms of the English Language Course were not carried out).

  - 77% in the field of training abroad (reasons: cancellation by the training contractor, nonreferral to training due to work commitments, other reasons).

SAF members improved their abilities for the performance of tasks through participation in
various forms of education and training within the Military Schools Centre and in comparable
military education and training courses abroad. In addition, they acquired knowledge at
educational institutions in the RS, the Police, the CP Centre and elsewhere. A total of 835
members were referred to education in the RS.

In 2015, the education of SAF members was conducted in accordance with the plans. Eleven
contracts were concluded with members of the SAF to obtain the 2[nd] Bologna cycle education
which includes military subjects.

As many as 209 SAF members were referred to individual preparations for the English
language test, 101 members were referred to English language refresher courses, and 22
members were referred to the English language beginner course. A total of 904 candidates
were referred to English placement tests. The advanced higher English language course was
implemented, which was attended by representatives of foreign armed forces in addition to
members of the SAF, the MoD and the Police.

A total of 2,926 members of the SAF, the MoD, the Police and foreign armed forces were
referred to different forms of military education and training within the organizational units of the
Military Schools Centre. The planned military education and training courses were completed by
2,711 candidates.

Various functional and career education and training courses abroad were attended by 263 SAF
members, of which 147 were officers, 74 NCOs, 20 soldiers, and 22 military specialists. Twenty
members were referred to career education. Most SAF members attended military education
and training courses in accordance with the IMET programme, in the framework of which 50
SAF members attended various education and training courses in the US and the Federal
Republic of Germany.

Reasons for the non-realization of the planned referrals to training abroad were various. Some
courses were cancelled, while for some, the MoD was unable to get a place.

_Available funds for the education and training of individuals_

_in the SAF between 2010 and 2015_

The table shows the trend of reductions in funds for the last six years. In 2015, 61% less
financial resources were allocated to the education and training of individuals in the SAF than in
2010. The input in the education and training of individuals does not follow the needs resulting
from the maintenance of the current and the development of new capabilities. Deployments to
functional education and training courses were carried out mainly to grant licenses and powers
necessary for the members to perform their professional duties.

### 6 IMPLEMENTATION OF THE INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION PLAN

International activities in the MoD were conducted within the programmes of bilateral and
multilateral cooperation, the EU, NATO, sports (Conseil International du Sport Militaire – CISM),
and military and technical cooperation. Activities were carried out in accordance with the
priorities, the programme and the objectives set out in the 2015 MoD Business Plan.

The objectives in the field of international cooperation supported the achievement of key
conceptual objectives and priorities of the MoD.

Based on the Annual Plan of International Cooperation for 2015, the MoD planned 1,307
events. A total of 838 events, or 64.1%, were realized, while 468 planned events remained
unrealized. Altogether, 296 unplanned events were realized. The MoD spent EUR 955,350 to
implement the plan of international cooperation. Details are shown in the table below.

The discrepancy between the planned activities and the actual realization is still high. At the
same time, the number of new, unplanned events that could not have been foreseen during the
planning period increased.

The number of realized unplanned events reminds us that planning should also take into
account new obligations and foresee their subsequent execution. Assessment of the realization
of planned events must also take into account the following factors: cancellation or deferral of
the planned events; reduction of financial resources for international cooperation in other
countries; planned proposals written as a form of possible cooperation; revised objectives
aimed at by certain activities; and organizational and personnel changes.

In the field of international military cooperation for 2015-2016, the SAF Management Plan, inter
alia, focused on the strategic partners in the Alliance with which the MoD cooperates in
international operations and missions, and on the neighbouring countries with which the MoD
has already established project cooperation. The strategic interest of the RS remains in the
Western Balkans (KFOR, EUFOR Althea, NATO integration and counselling structures), the
neighbouring countries (Italy, Austria, Hungary and Croatia) and the strategic partner countries
(USA, Germany, France). Therefore, cooperation with these countries should be intensified.

In 2015, the ACPDR implemented a number of international activities which followed the
priorities defined by the programme and objectives of the ACPDR for 2015, as well as the
adopted international obligations of the RS. All the key objectives set out in the priorities of the
ACPDR's international cooperation were fully achieved.

**6.1 International Cooperation within NATO**

In 2015, the SAF carried out 208 events within the framework of NATO. SAF representatives
participated in the meetings of various NATO expert committees and working bodies, joint
military exercises and various other professional and coordination activities.

In 2015, NATO began preparing to transfer the centre of gravity from operations to operational
readiness across the whole spectrum of possible sources of threat, particularly in the
implementation of the Readiness Action Plan (RAP), adopted at the summit in Wales in
September 2014. During the operations, the focus was on completing the ISAF operation
(Afghanistan) and on creating conditions for the Resolute Support interim mission.

The focus of transformation is on the attainment of key capabilities within the NATO Defence
Planning Process (NDPP), on the Connected Forces Initiative (CFI) and Smart Defence (SD),
and on the renewal of training and exercises (ETEE), with the emphasis on upgrading the
operation and responsiveness of the NATO Response Force (NRF).

The RS participated in the following important activities abroad: conferences of the NATO
Military Committee at the level of the Chiefs of General Staff, a strategic conference with
partners, and a conference of the heads of transformation in the organization of the Allied
Command Transformation (ACT).

102/115


-----

Among the most important events was the organization and implementation of the international
conference of the Association of Military Aviation Investigation Bodies – AFFS(C)E – on the
safety of military aircraft flights of NATO member states and associate members.

The RS participated in the purchase of an important NATO capability for the provision of Air
Ground Surveillance (AGS). All procedures for the realization of this capability are provided by
NAGSMA. By participating in this project, the RS demonstrates its readiness in the provision of
critical NATO capabilities, thus identifying itself as a credible NATO member. Altogether, 15
NATO members were included in the purchase. In the context of industrial participation, the RS
is currently ensured participation at the level of 64% of the invested funds. The Slovenian
company ComTrade, d.o.o. is participating in the development of software.

By participating in the NATO Support and Procurement Agency (NSPA), the RS has a double
interest: the provision of cheaper joint purchases and services (e.g. maintenance of helicopters,
the provision of information and communication support), and the participation of Slovenian
companies which are consequently included in the Agency's database.

In March, the NATO Crisis Management Exercise 2015 (CMX15) was implemented, along with
the planning conferences for CMX16. The MoD participated at the main planning conference in
Lithuania and the final conference in Hungary, and organized a conference on event planning,
held in Portorož. The latter was attended by over 200 representatives of the Alliance and the
partner countries of Sweden and Finland. NATO and the participants rated both the
organization and the execution of the conference as highly successful.

**6.2 International Cooperation within the European Union**

In the field of military cooperation with the EU, the SAF carried out 18 events in 2015. As with
events in the framework of the Alliance, participation at the majority of events was, due to
rationalization, taken over by the Military Representation of the SAF to the EU. The
representation carried out its mission by representing national interests in the EU committees
and working groups within the EU Military Committee (EUMC). Thematically, activities were
conducted according to the December European Council meeting on the Common Security and
Defence Policy. In addition to the Council, attention was given to the preparation and
deployment of the EUTM Mali mission. The Slovenian navy, with its military boat Triglav, still
cooperates successfully in the EU's EUNAVFOR MED Operation. Another very important
contribution of the SAF is linked to its active co-creation of the newly emerging EU Global and
Security Strategy.

103/115


-----

Within the European Defence Agency (EDA), the SAF is actively involved in the CODABA
system which represents the mechanism of cooperation between countries in projects of
equipping. The SAF participated in the creation of a new version of the CODABA, which will
become operational at the beginning of 2016. As many as 21 potential cooperation projects
were identified for Slovenia, which expressed its interest in seven of them.

In the context of tasks of the POC representatives for the protection of European critical
infrastructure in the RS, participation in six events related to the implementation of activities was
planned. These events arose from the European Programme for Critical Infrastructure
Protection (EPCIP) and the Council Directive 2008/114/EC of 8th December 2008, on the
identification and designation of European critical infrastructures and the assessment of the
need to improve their protection (hereinafter referred to as the Directive). The activities planned
for the European Commission (hereinafter referred to as the Commission) were not fully
realized, as the Commission failed to organize three thematic events and indefinitely postponed
a meeting scheduled in the framework of the external dimension of the EPCIP and convened in
November 2015.

In May 2015, the 6[th] meeting of experts on critical infrastructure protection was held between
the EU, USA and Canada. The presentations and discussions focused on the contemporary
challenges in the field of critical infrastructure faced by the stakeholders who seek to preserve
and protect critical infrastructure; on the fight against violent extremism in the context of critical
infrastructure; the provision of security and the resilience of critical infrastructure; cyber security;
and the implementation of an online exercise prior to the next expert meeting.

The meeting of the POC representatives for the protection of European critical infrastructure
focused on the main priorities of the European Union, arising from the European agenda for
security which was adopted in April 2015; on the progress made in the integrated pilot project in
the energy sector; on potential cooperation proposals relating to the external dimension of the
EPCIP; and on the conclusions of the workshop entitled Insider Threats to Critical Infrastructure.
Discussion was also held on the added value and "hidden" directive benefits, despite some
criticism that its implementation has not been completely successful, and on the new content
found on the SINAPSE version of CIWIN (Critical Infrastructure Warning Information Network),
as well as on the future of the EPCIP.

**6.3 Bilateral Cooperation**

The annual bilateral cooperation programmes are prepared together with 26 countries on the
basis of the framework agreements on the cooperation of countries in the area of defence. In
accordance with the Declaration of the National Assembly on the Western Balkans, the
Guidance on the Activities of the RS in the Western Balkans, and the Action Plan on the
Activities of the RS in the Western Balkans 2015, part of the operations planning was oriented
towards the countries of that region, in addition to the four neighbouring countries. The number
of realized events was 179.

104/115


-----

In 2015, the most intensive cooperation was established with the neighbouring countries: Italy,
Croatia, Hungary and Austria. Much intensive cooperation was focused on supporting
Montenegro on its way to NATO integration. The traditionally intensive cooperation with the
USA was based primarily on the fulfillment of various cooperation programmes (IMET, Mil to
Mil).

Among the strategic partners, in addition to the USA, intensive bilateral cooperation takes place
with France, the Federal Republic of Germany, and Italy. Cooperation with France is mainly
focused on the expert area of the navy. With Italy, Slovenia cooperates in international
operations and missions, and the Multinational Forces (MLF). Italy, which is Slovenia's most
important strategic partner, is also an important lead nation within NATO's Framework Nation
Concept (FNC).

The MoD leadership hosted the Defence Ministers of Italy, Azerbaijan, Romania, Serbia and
Montenegro; moreover, it hosted the Defence Minister of the Czech Republic on a working visit,
as well as a large number of Ambassadors and defence attachés accredited to the RS during
demonstration and working visits. During visits to the SAF members participating in the
ALTHEA and KFOR operations, Minister Andreja Katič held working meetings with the Minister
of Defence of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Minister of the Kosovo Security Forces of the
Republic of Kosovo.

Cooperation with the Ministry of the Kosovo Security Forces continued successfully, with an
exchange of experience in the area of the public procurement system. A bilateral meeting was
held in Ljubljana in May, and included an introductory visit to the Public Procurement
Directorate at the Ministry of Public Administration, as well as a visit to a commercial
organization engaged in the production of military equipment.

In the context of bilateral cooperation in the field of mapping and geospatial issues, coordination
continued regarding a new agreement with the Ministry of Defence of the Republic of Austria.
The new agreement will enable widespread participation in joint projects in the professional and
development fields, and exchange in the area of digital map data, which is particularly important
for the production of border topographic maps. The agreement is expected to be signed in
2016.

As part of the harmonization and coordination of activities for the protection of European critical
infrastructure in the RS, an introductory bilateral meeting with the Republic of Croatia was
carried out in April 2015, during the process of identifying potential European critical
infrastructure in line with the Decree on European Critical Infrastructure (Official Gazette of the
RS, no. 35/11). Moreover, letters on the state of the identification and designation of European
critical infrastructure were exchanged with all the neighbouring countries.

**6.4 Multilateral Cooperation**

In 2015, the SAF carried out 78 multilateral events.

105/115


-----

In the field of multilateral forms of cooperation, the most important for the SAF was the further
development and integration of the Multinational Centre of Excellence for Mountain Warfare,
which, in 2015, completed the transformation processes to become a NATO Centre of
Excellence.
The SAF actively participated in the regional initiatives of the Western Balkans (participation in
the meetings of the Adriatic Charter, the SEDM, and others), and the DECI (Defense
Cooperation Initiative) at the level of Chiefs of General Staffs or their deputies. Numerous
expert meetings were carried out for further development of the Balkan Medical Task Force
(BMTF), which is progressing towards the establishment of a regular structure.

The Verification Centre carried out 17 multilateral activities and thus increased the intensity of
cooperation in relation to previous years (activity under the international Treaty on Open Skies,
obligations under the OSCE Vienna Document).

**6.5 Military Technical Cooperation**

Two events were carried out in the field of military technology. The number of events was
limited to the most important ones due to the financial situation. In this category in 2015, among
others, the takeover of the upgraded Cougar helicopter was carried out (France).

**6.6 Sports – CISM**

In 2015, the SAF was actively engaged in the activities of the International Military Sports
Council (CISM), which is the leading world organization in the field of military sports. Eight
events were realized, three of them in the RS.

The key activities were participation at the 6[th] Military World Games in October in Mungyeong in
the Republic of Korea, where 16 SAF athletes participated very successfully and won five
medals, two fourth places and one fifth place; and the organization of a meeting of the CISM
Central European Initiative "Neighbours" in September in Poljče, attended by delegations from
Austria, Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Germany and Switzerland.

106/115


-----

**6.7 Other**

In other fields of cooperation and in the field of spiritual care of members of the SAF Peacetime
Structure Abroad, 15 events were planned for 2015. Of these, the SAF carried out ten planned
and two unplanned events.

## IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RISK REGISTER

The risk register is a set of anticipated risks that could have a negative influence on the
economical use of the fiscal resources and the attainment of the MoD's goals, and the set of all
measures prepared in advance and applied for preventive and timely reduction of the negative
consequences of risks.

Based on the MoD’s risk register, 115 risks were anticipated in 2015. The level of risk is
determined based on the risk probability estimate and the consequence estimate, graded by
numbers from one to three; a higher value means a greater probability of occurrence or greater
consequences should the risk occur. The product of both estimates signifies the level of risk.
Depending on the value of the product, four levels of risk are determined:

  - Level 9 – very high probability of the occurrence of the risk and its consequences (red).

  - Level 6 – high probability of the occurrence of the risk and its consequences (orange).

  - Levels 3, 4 – medium probability of the occurrence of the risk and its consequences
(yellow).

  - Levels 1, 2 – low probability of the occurrence of the risk and its consequences (green).

Of all risks, 10 risks or 8% were assessed with the highest level of risk, 47 risks or 35% with a
high level of risk, 50 risks or 38% with a medium level of risk, and 25 risks or 19% with a low
level of risk, as depicted in the histogram below.

_Structure of Risks in Reference to the Levels of Risk_

The chart below depicts the realization of risks in reference to individual levels of risk. With very
high and high probability risks, namely levels 9 and 6, the realization was 60% and 45%. This
means that with these risks, the assessment of the level of probability was correct, and that
consequently, measures in response to the incurred risks were prepared and implemented on
time. The level of realization of low level risks (1-3) was 0%, 39% and 14%.

The prevailing risks with a very high probability of occurrence are procedural in nature and refer
to the management of the main processes, especially the maintenance of the existing and
establishment of the planned capabilities; logistics processes, such as the supply and
management of physical assets; and other support processes. Moreover, the prevailing risks
with a very high probability of occurrence are also of project nature and refer to the field of
spatial planning, the status of real estate in the Land Register, and untimely implementation of
infrastructure projects, which is also the result of delays in the registration of easement in the
Land Register. Additionally, risks with a very high probability of occurrence include those of
financial and regulatory type. Financial risks refer to the failure to provide or maintain the target

108/115


-----

capabilities, while the regulatory risks refer to the lack of legal bases regulating the fields of
defence planning and crisis management.

_Realization of Risks in Reference to Individual Levels of Risk_

In 2015, 51 anticipated risks or 39% occurred, and appropriate measures were applied to the
majority of them. The measures were successfully implemented for 74% of all the risks that
occurred.

_The Level of Implementation of Measures for Realized Risks_

An update of the risk register of the largest budget user at the MoD, the SAF, prevents a
comprehensive overview of the sequence of realized and unrealized risks in 2014 and 2015.
The highest level risks recorded in the risk register for 2014 and 2015 were sequentially realized
in three cases, and appropriate measures were implemented. High level risks were sequentially
realized in six cases, and measures were implemented. The sequence of risks was not realized
in five cases, so no measures were implemented. There were 21 medium level risks which were
either realized sequentially or were not realized, and measures were implemented or not as
appropriate.

The objective for these risks is to adopt such measures as to reduce their level, even if they
cannot be completely managed and controlled, so that they no longer pose a risk. The

109/115


-----

sequential non-realization of certain risks in 2014 and 2015 means that the risks were managed
and the level of their recurrence can be reduced.

However, there are still too many risks on which the MoD has no direct influence, as it depends
on the available funds allocated under the RS national budget. In such cases, it is necessary to
ensure the least possible impact of such risks on the achievement of the key MoD objectives.

The structure of risks in reference to their type (procedural, project-related, personnel-related,
regulatory, financial or security) shows that the majority of risks (37%) are procedural in nature,
as depicted in the circular diagram below.

_Structure of Risks in Reference to their Type_

The predominance of procedural and project-related risks is a warning that processes and
project management should be given more attention in the future, as they directly influence the
effectiveness and efficiency of operations. In a metaphorical sense, this means that the MoD's
priority in the short-term must be to further strive for the effective use of the limited financial,
personnel and material resources, and systematically direct them towards the implementation of
the key long- and medium-term objectives.

Effective implementation of measures for the management of risks and the prevention and
mitigation of their consequences greatly contributes to the further development of the defence
system, which is extremely important in the ever more complex, changing and unpredictable
security environment.

## REPORT SUMMARY

The year 2015 was very demanding and dynamic for the MoD. Events in 2015 reaffirmed the
importance of the area of defence, the protection against natural and other disasters, and the
response of the RS to various crises.

**I. SLOVENIAN ARMED FORCES**

The SAF maintained its existing capabilities in its area of operation, but was unable to establish
any major new capabilities due to the limited financial resources. **The modernization and**
**equipping of the SAF were accomplished in accordance with the available financial resources.**
The SAF purchased 1,200 sets of the new combat uniform, some of the most urgent personal
and protective equipment, and ammunition and equipment for Forward Air Controllers. It also
updated the fleet of personal vehicles. The upgrade of the Cougar transport helicopters was
completed. Five HMMWV M1151 vehicles and seven used 6x6 MRAP vehicles for the efficiency
and mobility of teams for the detection and destruction of unexploded ordnance were purchased
through foreign military assistance. Spare parts for both types of vehicles were delivered. The
SAF introduced a number of capabilities into operational use: systems for the operation of
Cerklje ob Krki Airfield (illumination, navigation, radio navigation, meteorological and information
systems), the new protective tactical vest, airport fire rescue vehicles, the RGW 90 mobile
training system, a man-portable short range radar system, an emergency ambulance, the 6x6
MRAP vehicle for the Explosive Ordnance Disposal Unit, an infantry obstacle course, active
earmuffs, AN/PRC-117G Multiband Manpack Radios, and a firearms training simulator in Kranj.

The SAF was actively involved in the system of protection against natural and other disasters,
mainly focusing on **helicopter mountain rescue and helicopter emergency medical**
**assistance, as well as the setting up of launch bridges. In 2015, in comparison to the previous**
year, one fifth more rescue operations and transportation of casualties were carried out. The
duty crew of the 151[st] Rotary Wing Squadron carried out 229 rescue operations, most of which
were mountain rescue operations and helicopter emergency medical assistance.

In 2015, the SAF continued its credible and highly appreciated **participation in international**
**operations and missions (IOM). Despite the limited financial resources it ensured the**
participation of approximately 350 members a year. The largest operation was the KFOR
operation in Kosovo which also involved civilian functional experts in addition to SAF members.
The functions of members of the Slovenian contingents in Kosovo included maintaining a
secure and stable environment and freedom of movement, protecting KFOR facilities and
facilities of special importance, reconnaissance and monitoring of security and general
conditions in the area of operations, providing helicopter services, rapid response forces and
tactical reserves, and performing staff duties. Slovenia participated in the newly established
NATO advisory mission in Afghanistan (RSM), the new EU operation in the southern part of the
central Mediterranean Sea (EUNAVFOR MED in Sofia), the EU mission in the Sahel region of
Africa (EUTM Mali) and the UN missions in the Middle East (UNIFIL, UNTSO).

The internationally high-profile cooperation of the multi-purpose boat Triglav in the EU's
Operation Sofia, which is also humanitarian in nature, was very important. SAF members
rescued some 600 migrants from the dangerous sea.

**II. ADMINISTRATION OF THE RS FOR CIVIL PROTECTION AND DISASTER RELIEF**

In 2015, the operational readiness of the system of protection against natural and other
disasters was provided through continuous operation of the notification centres and public
**rescue services, and through the preparedness of other civil protection (CP) rescue services,**

111/115


-----

commissions, and commanders of units and headquarters. The current level of preparedness to
respond to natural and other disasters was maintained. Protection, rescue and relief (PRR)
forces acted in over 14,500 events, with almost 20,000 structures of PRR forces or a total of
about 122,000 members of different units, services and other structures being activated.

In 2015, the ACPDR co-financed activities of services, societies, units, companies, institutes
and other organizations in the field of protection and rescue in the amount of almost EUR 7.5
million, which ensured the operational readiness of professional rescue services, firefighting
units of general importance, societies and other organizations, rescue services and structures
which operate on a voluntary basis.

**Education and training took place at the Training Centre for Civil Protection and Disaster**
Relief in Ig and the Centre's training units in Pekre, Sežana and Logatec. Training was provided
to members of various PRR forces and public employees from the field of protection and
rescue. Various forms of education, training and other activities were attended by over 28,000
participants: over 17,000 at the Training Centre for Civil Protection and Disaster Relief in Ig,
about 6,000 at the Centre’s training unit in Pekre, 2,400 at the Logatec training unit, 1,500 at the
Sežana training unit and 900 at other locations outside the Training Centre.

**The National Notification Centre (NNC) and 13 regional notification centres (RNC),**
responding to the emergency call number 112, perform operational and communications tasks
regarding monitoring, notification and warning 24 hours a day and 365 days a year. Thus, all
citizens are guaranteed emergency medical assistance, rapid activation of rescue workers,
primarily firefighters, and appropriate responses by different rescue services during natural and
other disasters.

In 2015, the 13 RNCs received almost 500,000 emergency calls, which is an average of about
1,350 calls per day. They also received over 2,000 emergency calls in the form of text
messages. The most often activated were the firefighters, almost 20,000 times, mountain
rescuers, over 600 times, and rescue dog units, 130 times. On 1st December 2015, the
automated call from a damaged vehicle, the 112 eCall, was introduced into regular operational
use. By the end of the year, the RNC had received 28 automated call messages (eCalls).

In 2015, the ACPDR responded to over **14,500 different events, such as natural and other**
disasters, traffic accidents, fires and explosions, pollution, accidents involving dangerous
substances, nuclear and other events, findings of unexploded ordnance, supply disruptions,
damage to buildings, and technical and other assistance. The PRR forces and other services
responded to these events. Through their timely and effective action and help to those affected,
the PRR forces undoubtedly contributed to the mitigation of damage and other consequences
caused by disasters.

**III. ADMINISTRATIVE PART OF THE MoD**

In the area of **critical infrastructure of national importance, a draft text of the Critical**
Infrastructure Act was prepared. The MoD organized a bilateral event with the Republic of
Croatia on the topic of identifying potential European critical infrastructure. It also began to use
the European Internal Security Funds, in the amount of EUR 380,000, for the implementation of
five projects, two of which have already been completed, while three are multi-annual and have
completion dates in 2018.

As the manager of the **National Defence Plan, the MoD prepared a report on the**
harmonization of Defence Plans with the Regulation on Defence Planning (Official Gazette of
the RS, no. 51/13). The report was presented to the RS Government, which adopted the
Decision on the adoption of the Defence Plan, composed of the Defence Plans of different

112/115


-----

ministries, certain Government offices, the Plan on the use of the SAF and the Plan of the RS
CP Headquarters. In compliance with the Plan of Exercises in the Defence System and the
System of Protection against Natural and Other Disasters, the MoD organized four
comprehensive exercises of the defence system in 2015.

In February 2015, the MoD first published an invitation to tender for the **co-financing of**
**activities of societies and associations operating in the public interest in war veterans.**
Contracts have been signed with nine investors.

In 2015, NATO representatives, on the basis of Slovenia's responses to the Defence Planning
**Capability Survey, prepared a draft review which honestly reflects the challenges faced in the**
area of defence. These challenges represent one of the best starting points for improvement
and will be taken into account in the implementation of the Strategic Defence Review 2016. The
report highlights some positive achievements of the RS, including cooperation in various
geographically dispersed international operations and missions, as well as maintaining certain
niche capabilities that are lacking in NATO but which exceed Slovenia's national requirements.

In 2015, in the field of **property management, the MoD became actively involved in the**
implementation of tasks required for the energy renovation of buildings. The most work was
invested in the collection and processing of data on buildings, which is important for energy
saving. Within the ENEP's application, a uniform system of data collection and processing was
established, identifying the most energy-wasteful buildings to be renovated in the future. In
recent years, the percentage of real estate registered in the Land Register and managed and
used by the MoD has risen, amounting to 82.3%. In the field of strategic communication with the
public, special attention has been devoted to informing the public of the MoD leadership's
efforts to strengthen cooperation with the local population in areas where the SAF is present, for
example in the Municipality of Postojna. The use of the Falcon aircraft for the transportation of
human organs for transplantation, which has already helped save a number of human lives,
received a great deal of media coverage and positive acceptance by the public.

For the first time since 2010, the MoD's financial plan for the provision of financial resources
was increased at the time of its revision. The RS has thus stopped and reversed the trend of
budget cuts in defence, and met one of the political commitments to ensure the growth of
defence financial resources. In 2015, the financial plan amounted to nearly EUR 344 million,
which is 4 million more than the year before. The share of defence expenditure in GDP in 2015
was slightly lower than in the previous year, mainly due to the high GDP growth and lower
levels of military pensions than previously planned.

Nominal assets for earnings decreased by almost EUR 3 million compared to the previous year,
mainly due to the lower average number of employees in the SAF. However, they still account
for 68.7% of the expenditure in the total financial plan, while capital expenditure only accounts
for 5% of the financial plan. In the future it will therefore be necessary to balance the internal
structure of expenditure, mainly by increasing the resources for infrastructure investment and
maintenance.

In 2015, the administrative part of the MoD achieved an approved and, in comparison to 2014, a
reduced personnel plan. The total number of employees in the administrative part of the MoD
decreased by 2%, to a total of 734 employees. At the end of 2015, the SAF was employing
7,055 active component members and 860 voluntary contract reserve members. A comparison
of the total number of civilian employees in the defence part of the MoD (BU 1911 and BU
1914) with other NATO members showed that the RS, with its 15%, has an exceptionally good
result, as the average proportion for NATO members is 19% of civilians in the total number of

employees. This means that the defence part of the MoD employs fewer civilians than most
NATO member states.

Activities in the acquisition and provision of personnel for military service of all categories
(professional military service, military service in the contract reserve and voluntary military
service), and especially in employment in the SAF, have resulted in an increase in employment
(265 employees) in 2015 as compared to the previous year (141 employees).

In 2016, the MoD will carry out a Strategic Defence Review which will provide a cross-section
of the situation, grounds for future development, and proposals for changes and improvements,
which will direct the MoD onto the path of development and progress in order to strengthen its
reputation and trust among the citizens, and to promote awareness of the importance of
national defence, and of protection and rescue of people and property.

**IV. MIGRANT ISSUES**

In the last third of 2015, the overall functioning of the MoD and its constituent bodies was
marked by the migrant issues, which many other European countries were also engaged in.

To monitor the events and coordinate the activities of state bodies dealing with the migrant
crisis in the framework of the National Crisis Management Centre, the administrative part of the
MoD established an **inter-ministerial analytical group which submitted daily reports to the**
Prime Minister of the RS.

The ACPDR participated in the **operational group at the Ministry of the Interior. Civil**
Protection was, due to the mass influx of migrants, responsible for the setting-up and
maintenance of temporary accommodation centres. Civil Protection was tasked with providing
temporary housing in the accommodation centres, establishing foundations for the functioning
of these centres, and coordinating the involvement of all participants. Together with the
competent bodies, rescue services, and humanitarian and non-governmental organizations, the
ACPDR organized the reception and accommodation of migrants and provided food and other
life-essential provisions, as well as lay first aid, helping to reunite families, and providing
protection and other necessary services. All employees of the ACPDR regional offices were
included in the activities, establishing capabilities for the organization of accommodation and
reception centres, and ensuring their operation and management. In cooperation with the
Ministry of Labour, Family, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities and the Employment Service
of Slovenia, the ACPDR concluded 259 employment contracts with community work providers
to assist in the management of migration flows.

**The SAF provided vital assistance and support to Civil Protection in dealing with migrant**
issues. To direct and stem the flow of migrants, it set up over 140km of temporary technical
obstacles. Support was provided by over 4,600 SAF members who, in accordance with the
needs identified, managed the accommodation centres, prepared and distributed hot meals and
drinks, prepared cargo, disinfected the premises, carried out pest control, and performed a
variety of transport services. SAF members distributed over 150,000 hot meals to migrants. In
addition to providing assistance to Civil Protection, the SAF supported the Police in the wider
protection of the state border and the protection of certain facilities. To this end, it provided
transport for police officers and material resources, participated in the protection of the state
border with technical means and patrols, assisted in the wider protection of the border with
helicopters, and, in line with the requirements, supported the Police with the available material
resources. Additionally, the SAF helped the Police in the transportation of migrants, the
protection of collection centres and the implementation of migrant escorts. Every day, an
average of 470 SAF members were engaged in supporting the Police.

In 2015, the reception and accommodation centres provided care for over 380,000 migrants.
On average, almost 5,000 migrants entered the RS on a daily basis. The greatest pressure on
the border occurred on 21st October, when as many as 12,616 people entered Slovenia from
Croatia. A total of 29,730 members of Civil Protection and of various non-governmental and
humanitarian organizations and societies, volunteers, public work participants and public
employees were involved in the accommodation and care of migrants, and in the provision of
the necessary material and technical resources in 2015.

In 2015, for the first time after the beginning of the economic crisis and recession, the MoD
succeeded in ensuring the nominal growth of the financial plan. In light of all the rationalization
of the MoD and the successfully implemented measures which helped the RS survive the crisis,
Slovenia ranks among the top in public administration. In the coming fiscal years, due to
successful rationalization measures, the MoD could justifiably expect a significant increase in
financial resources, which would ensure a new impetus to its development and successful
operation.
