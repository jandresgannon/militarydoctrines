###### SECURITY ENVIRONMENT


IAF SU-30s dominating the air space


-----

##### The emergence of ideology linked terrorism, the
###### spread of small arms and light weapons(SALW), the proliferation of WMD (Weapons of Mass Destruction) and globalisation of its economy are some of the factors which link India’s security directly with the extended neighbourhood


1.1 India has land frontiers extending

more than 15,500 kilometres and maritime

boundaries overlooking three major shipping

lanes. The country is strategically located vis
à-vis both continental Asia and the Indian

Ocean Region. It has a landmass of 3.3 million

square kilometres and is home to over a billion

people with varying ethnic, linguistic, religious

and cultural backgrounds.

1.2 The topography of India is diverse,

ranging from the snow clad Himalayas with

peaks over 28,000 feet to deserts, thick jungles

and vast plains. The Siachen Glacier in the

North is the world’s highest battle-field, with

posts located as high as 21,000 feet. India’s

Western border runs through deserts, fertile

plains and thickly forested mountains. The

North-Eastern frontier also comprises steep,

high ranges and dense tropical forests. To

the South, there are ranges close to the sea,

inland plateaus interspersed with river valleys,

coastal plains, and far-flung island territories

such as the Lakshadweep to the West and the

Andaman and Nicobar Islands to the East. On

three sides, from Gujarat to West Bengal, the

country is bordered by the Arabian Sea, Indian


Ocean and the Bay of Bengal. The Andaman

& Nicobar Islands located 1300 km away from

the nearest point on our East Coast assume

strategic predominance with respect to the

entrance to the Malacca Straits. In the Arabian

Sea, the Lakshadweep and Minicoy islands,

situated on the sea-lanes of communication

running eastwards from the Persian Gulf and

the Red Sea are 450 km away from the nearest

point on the West Coast. India is, thus, a

maritime as well as a continental entity.

1.3 The geographical and topographical

diversity, especially on the land borders which

we share with seven neighbouring countries

(viz., Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, China,

Myanmar, Nepal and Pakistan) poses unique

challenges to our Armed Forces. India’s

peninsular dimension places it adjacent to

one of the most vital sea-lanes of the world

stretching from the Suez Canal and the Persian

Gulf to the Straits of Malacca through which

55,000 ships and much of the oil from the Gulf

region transit each year.

1.4 India’s location at the base of continental

Asia and the top of the Indian Ocean gives

it a vantage point in relation to both Central


-----

Asia and the Indian Ocean Region (IOR).

Additionally, India’s size, strategic location,

trade links and exclusive economic zone (EEZ)

links its security environment directly with the

extended neighbourhood, particularly with

neighbouring countries and the regions of

Central Asia, South-East Asia, the Gulf and the

Indian Ocean. These strategic-economic factors

impose an increasingly larger responsibility on

India.

1.5 In the post cold war international

scenario, the 9/11 terrorist attack against the

USA and terrorist strikes in many other parts

of the world have brought about greater

international convergence on security issues

and challenges. The emergence of ideology

linked terrorism, the spread of small arms

and light weapons(SALW), the proliferation

of WMD (Weapons of Mass Destruction) and

globalisation of its economy are some of the

factors which link India’s security directly with

the extended neighbourhood.

1.6 South Asia hosts a diversity of political

experiences and systems. The region also faces

the menace of terrorism and problems by way

of proliferation of arms and drugs. Against this

background, India stands as a bulwark against

fundamentalism and extremism. It is a centre

of economic dynamism in the region and as

a plural democracy, a bastion of stability and

peaceful coexistence.

**The Global Security Environment**

1.7 Over the last years, the global balance

of power has witnessed new adjustments and


the unfolding dynamic transformations are

generating new strategic uncertainties. The

continuing economic crisis in Europe and the

Western world is a major cause of worry for

the global economy. Simultaneously, the Asia

Pacific region has been acquiring an increasing

salience in the economic and strategic

balance of power. The rise of countries like

India, China, Brazil and South Africa has also

been an important development vis-à-vis the

established global order.

1.8 As rising nations and non-State actors

become more powerful, emerging risks require

greater attention. The security environment

has become more complex, with asymmetric

threats from terrorism, piracy etc. Technology

advances in telecommunications and other

areas have provided potent force multipliers

to boost the capabilities and impact of terrorist

activities. Despite international efforts to deal

with terrorism, the threat from terrorism remains

potent. There is continuing concern over the

Launch of BrahMos from INS Ranvir
during the Exercise TROPEX


-----

immediate neighbourhood remaining a hub for

international terrorist organisations. The threat

of piracy and terrorism to international trade

and safety of the sea lanes of communication

and the spread of piracy remain cause for

concern.

1.9 The international security situation

continued to be adversely affected by continuing

conflict and violence. The political churning

unleashed in West Asia and North Africa by the

‘Arab Spring’ brought to the fore fresh concerns

in the already complex security scenario in the

region. The complex and dynamic interplay of

economic, diplomatic and military factors in

the Asia Pacific also continued to impact the

overall security assessment for the region as a

whole.

1.10 In view of the multifaceted security

concerns and the global dimensions of

the challenges, India has strengthened its

participation in multilateral institutions and

deepened its strategic partnerships with various

countries so as to effectively contribute, as a

responsible stakeholder, to


which India is an active member. India has

supported efforts to establish an open and

inclusive security architecture for the region.

India’s policy is to encourage and participate in

cooperative approaches which would enable

all countries in the region to address traditional

and non-traditional security challenges and to

ensure that the critical sea lanes in the region

are kept open, secure and free for navigation

and trade. India’s continuing engagement with

ASEAN led fora like the ADMM Plus and ASEAN

Regional Forum are a part of our progressive

and multifaceted bilateral and multilateral

partnerships with the ASEAN community. At

the same time, India is mindful of the impact

that inter-State tensions may have on economic

relations and on the military balance in the

region and the manner in which these would

affect our national interests.

1.12 The developments associated with

the Arab Spring were seen as introducing

a democratic dynamic in West Asia and

North Africa. While these were welcomed

universally, there are


concerns about the impact

of these developments

on the security situation

in the region and the

consequences for the

flow of energy supplies.

India imports a significant

proportion of its energy

requirements from

countries in the region and

in addition, has to also

take into consideration


regional and global peace

and stability.

1.11 The developments

in the Asia Pacific continue

to underline the need for

initiatives to build trust and

confidence in the region.

At the political level, a

key development was the

establishment of the East

Asia Summit forum, of

common concerns including terrorism and Somalia and trans-national organized crime

and engagement with Pakistan. However, the

existence of terrorist camps across the India
Pak border and continued infiltrations across

the LoC continue to pose a threat.

1.17 The  situation  in   Afghanistan is

critical to India and the increase in terrorist

attacks in that country are a cause of concern,

particularly in the context of a drawdown of


international  forces in the country. India

remains committed to an Afghan-led resolution

of the crisis facing  the  country and

continues  to support the capacity building

of the Afghan security forces to this end. The

strategic partnership agreement between India

and Afghanistan signals the commitment of

both countries to  build on the bilateral

relationship in all spheres, including security

cooperation aimed at enhancing mutual

capability in the fight against terrorism and

other security challenges faced by both

countries.

1.18 Although the unresolved boundary

dispute between India and China has been a

factor in India’s security calculus, India has

a strategic and cooperative partnership with

China, in which the effort has been to work

on areas of mutual interest which would

enable both countries to pursue common

goals of growth and development. India’s

policy has been to engage with China on the

principles of mutual trust and respect for each

other’s interests and concerns.  India remains

conscious and watchful of the implications of

China’s military profile in the immediate and

extended neighbourhood.

1.19 India shares a unique relationship of

friendship and cooperation with Nepal. The

bilateral ties have been characterized by open

borders and deep-rooted people-to-people

contacts of kinship and culture and the security

and economic interests of both countries

are intertwined. The process of democratic

transition in Nepal has gathered momentum


-----

and as a close friend and neighbour, India

stands committed to support the people and

the government of Nepal in consolidating

the peaceful democratic transition and in its

economic development efforts.

1.20 Cooperative relations between India and

Bangladesh continued to be a positive factor in

the regional security scenario. Both countries

share a convergence of views on security

matters and on managing border security

concerns. Bilateral efforts are been pursued

for the settlement of boundary related issues

and to enhance border management. The two

countries continued to engage in constructive

cooperation on matters relating to economic

and social development.

1.21 India-Myanmar relations are reinforced

by historical, cultural, ethnic and religious ties.

India continues to engage with Myanmar on

various fronts, including trade and infrastructure

and cooperation in security matters is also

being pursued. The Government of Myanmar

has assured that its territory would not be

allowed for activities inimical to India.

1.22 India-Sri Lanka relations remain close,

cooperative and friendly. Maritime security

challenges and the maintenance of peace and

stability in the common Indian Ocean region

are issues which underpin the convergences

in the strategic interests of both countries.

India continues to urge Sri Lanka in achieving

a national reconciliation and in expeditiously

reaching a lasting political settlement where all

its citizens can live in peace. India is already

working with the Sri Lankan Government in


its rehabilitation and reconstruction efforts in

Northern Sri Lanka and is pursuing efforts to

enhance bilateral cooperation in a range of

areas, including defence and security.

1.23 India and Bhutan have a mutually

productive and beneficial bilateral relationship,

based on mutual trust and understanding. India

has had extensive cooperation with Bhutan in

areas such as power, transport, communications

infrastructure, education, IT, industry, medicine

and agriculture. India remains committed to

assist the Royal Government of Bhutan in its

socio-economic development.

1.24 The traditional warm and friendly

relationship between India and the Maldives

has been based on a convergence of views and

interests between both countries on strategic

issues at the regional and international level.

As a maritime neighbour, Maldives occupies

an important position in India’s security

construct and this is reflected in strong bilateral

cooperation in defence and security matters,

which is based on the mutual interests of both

countries.

1.25 The Indian Ocean, spread over an area

of 68.56 million square kilometres, is central to

India’s maritime interests and concerns. India’s

economic development is crucially dependent

on the sea because of the criticality of sea

borne trade in an increasingly inter-linked

world, as well as because of the potential of

vast economic resources of the oceans. India

sits astride major commercial routes and

energy lifelines in the Indian Ocean, namely,

the Malacca Straits, Six and Ten degree


-----

channel and the Persian Gulf. Annually, US

$200 billion worth of oil passes through the

Straits of Hormuz and US $60 billion through

the Malacca Strait. The security of shipping

along the sea lanes of communications in the

Indian Ocean Region (IOR) is, therefore, of

vital interest. India’s maritime interests involve

the safeguarding of our coastline and island

territories and also of our interests in the EEZ,

as well as in maintaining open and secure Sea

Lanes of Communication.

1.26 The increased incidence of piracy, gun

running and terrorism in the IOR continue to

remain issues of serious concern. Despite the

presence of naval warships of many countries

for patrolling operations in the Gulf of Aden,

the menace of piracy has not abated. The

Indian Navy, which has been given the overall

responsibility for maritime security is working

in coordination with the Coast Guard and other

Central and State agencies to deal with challenges

of threats from the sea. The intelligence sharing

mechanism has been streamlined through the

creation of Joint Operation Centres and multi
agency coordination mechanism. The Indian

Navy and Coast Guard have enhanced coastal

surveillance and patrolling and joint exercises

are also being regularly conducted with other

agencies to improve operational coordination.

India is also engaged in enhancing cooperative

interactions and exchanges with various

countries in the IOR to tackle common security

challenges. The Indian Navy is working in

coordination with the Navies of various


countries in the Gulf of Aden. India is in favour

of strengthening multilateral cooperation

under the UN framework to meet the complex

challenges of maritime security.

**Internal Security Challenges**

1.27 India has been facing multifaceted

internal security challenges which have

included left wing extremism, an ongoing

proxy war in Kashmir and militancy in some

Northeast states.

1.28 Attempts at infiltration into Jammu and

Kashmir by terrorists from Pakistan and Pak

occupied Kashmir (POK) are continuing cause

for concern, although such attempts are being

effectively tackled by the Security Forces. The

security situation in the North-Eastern States has

continued to improve. The activities of certain

militant groups who continue to be engaged

in building up capabilities are being closely

monitored.  In view of the external linkages

of some of these insurgent groups, it will be

necessary to remain alert and prepared to

tackle the problem of militancy in the region.

1.29 The dynamic regional and global

security environment present a wide spectrum

of challenges to India which must be faced

rapidly and effectively, in order to sustain and

support the growth and rise of the country and

the development of her people. The country

and our defence forces remain fully prepared

to tackle all challenges.

###### INDIAN ARMY

The Foot Soldier Marches on


-----

##### The Indian Army is committed to the defence of the
###### country from external and internal threats across the entire spectrum of warfare and the Army operations have significantly reduced the terrorist related incidents


###### SECURITY OVERVIEW

3.1 The changing global geo-political

dynamics presents the Nation with multiple

security challenges. While constantly reviewing

its operational preparedness/ postures to meet

the perceived security challenges, the Indian

Army (IA) is committed to the defence of the

country from external and internal threats

across the entire spectrum of warfare. Also, in

times of disaster/ natural calamities, the Indian

army is in the forefront, providing aid and

succour to the affected populace.

###### JAMMU AND KASHMIR

3.2 The security situation in J&K has been

stable in 2011 with an overall reduction in

violence. However, it has the potential to

deteriorate at short notice. Pakistan’s support

to the ongoing proxy war continues unabated,

the terror infrastructure, both in Pakistan/

PoK, remains intact. The Pakistan - Terrorist

- Separatist nexus continues their attempts to

foment trouble with an aim to internationalise

the Kashmir issue.


3.3 The Indian Army and other Security

Forces have been major contributors in

improving the environment through persistent

proactive and surgical Counter Terrorist

operations. Incident free conduct of Amarnath

Yatra, high turnout during the recently held

Panchayat Elections and a surge in domestic

and foreign tourism are all indicative of the

achievements of the Armed Forces in providing

conducive and secure environment. Though

the situation has improved, there is a need to

consolidate the gains.

3.4 **Situation Along the Borders: The**

ceasefire on the borders is holding out with a

few aberrations. There have been 56 cases of

ceasefire violations along the borders during

the current year, as compared to 57 in 2010.

The incidents of ceasefire violations are being

taken up through the established mechanism

of DGsMO talks, local level flag meetings and

hotlines.

3.5 Strict vigil is being maintained along the

borders, Counter Infiltration measures adopted

by the Army have been further strengthened.


-----

Infiltration attempts, however, continue.

During this year, 16 infiltration bids were foiled

in which 15 terrorists were killed.

3.6 **Situation in Hinterland: In 2011, the**

Army has killed 95 terrorists and apprehended

35 while suffering 15 casualties. The terrorist

leadership has successfully been targeted

and a total of 21 terrorist leaders have been

neutralised. Incidents of terrorists related

violence remains low due to the operational

ascendancy achieved by the Army.

3.7 **Amarnath Yatra: The Amarnath**

Yatra was conducted from June 29, 2011 till

August 13, 2011. The Army was responsible

for providing prophylactic security during the

Yatra. This year the response to the Yatra was

overwhelming and approximately 6,48,000

yatris visited Amarnath.


###### NORTH EAST

3.9 The prevailing security situation in the

North East has stabilised and is under control.

Violence levels have subsided significantly

as compared to previous years. There is

widespread support for peace by all sections

of the society thus facilitating progress on

developmental projects. Presently, talks/

suspension of operation (SoO)/ cease fire (CF)

is underway with 15 major groups. The Army,

along with other security forces, has played

a pivotal role been in bringing about this

welcome change.

3.10 **Assam:** The security situation in the

State is peaceful and under control. Relentless

operations by the security forces (SF) have

significantly reduced violent activities of Under


Ground (UG) groups in

the State. The Security

Forces have established

moral ascendancy over the

Under Ground operatives.

3.11 Continued  pressure

by security forces

combined with peace

initiatives by government

has resulted in a large

number of United

Liberation Front of Assam

(ULFA) cadres coming

over ground under

ULFA chairman Arbinda


In 2010, approximately

4,54,000 yatris had done

darshan of the holy shrine.

3.8  Panchayat Elections:

The State Government

successfully conducted

Panchayat elections in J&K

in 16 phases to elect 4,130

Sarpanches and 29,719

Panches. The encouraging

response of the population

(77.73%) to the Panchayat

elections, despite a boycott

call from the terrorists and


###### Amarnath Yatra was

 conducted from June 29,

 2011 till August 13, 2011.

 The Army was responsible

 for providing prophylactic

 security during the Yatra. 

 Approximately 6,48,000 yatris

 visited Amarnath in 2011,

 while 2010, approximately

 4,54,000 yatris had done

 darshan of the holy shrine.


separatists, indicates the desire of the populace

for peace.


Rajkhowa. The tripartite talks between Assam

Government, Government of India and the pro

-----

talk faction ULFA is progressing well. The anti
talk faction under Paresh Baruah, however,

continues attempts to revive violence and

sabotage the peace talks. Over 11 ULFA cadres

have been killed, nine have surrendered and 51

apprehended by the SF since January 2011.

3.12 The SoO Agreements with other Under

Ground Groups like the National Democratic

Front of Bodoland (NDFB) Progressive, both

factions of the Dimasa Halam Doagah (DHD)

and United Peoples Democratic Solidarity

(UPDS) are continuing. The anti - talk faction

of NDFB emerged as the most violent group,

Army operations against the group have

resulted in neutralisation of 148 cadres in this

year. The group has been forced to declare

unilateral ceasefire with effect from August 1,

2011.

3.13 Social harmony in Dima Hasao, already

under stress with renaming of the district, has

been witnessing ethnic tensions between the

Dimasas and the non-Dimasas. The proactive

stance adopted by army has ensured a secure

environment and thus reduced the number of

potential clashes in the region.

3.14 **Nagaland: Violence levels in the State**

have declined. The Inter Factional Clashes

between NSCN (IM) and NSCN (K) have also

considerably reduced. The ceasefire provisions

have also been extended to NSCN (Khole/

Khitovi) faction which emerged after split in

NSCN (K).

3.15 The reconciliation process spearheaded

by Forum for Naga Reconciliation has gained


momentum as the populace desires for peace.

The Army and Assam Rifles are keeping the UG

groups under check and ensuring adherence

of Ceasefire Ground Rules. The demand for

Frontier Nagaland state comprising of Mon,

Tuensang, Longleng and Kiphire is gaining

momentum under guidance of the Eastern

Naga Peoples Organisation.

3.16 **Manipur: Remaining ten members**

of Autonomous District Council have been

elected. The state is gearing up for assembly

polls due in February/ March next year. Despite

the fact that Manipur continues to be the most

disturbed state in the North East, violence levels

as compared to 2010 have reduced. Bulk of

the violent acts are confined to the de-notified

Imphal Valley. Operations by the Army and

Assam Rifles are continuing. Six terrorists of

various outfits have been eliminated and over

670 apprehended by the Security Forces since

January 2011.

3.17 SoO with Kuki and Zomi Under Ground

Groups has ushered peace in the Kuki and Zomi

inhabited areas and they have been impressed

upon to adhere to the SoO ground rules.

3.18 The state underwent the longest

blockade which commenced from August 1,

2011. The Kukis demanding a separate Sadar

Hills district called off blockade on November

1, 2011 while the Nagas lifted the blockade

on November 29, 2011. This blockade

caused immense inconvenience to the local

populace.

3.19 **Arunachal** **Pradesh** **(Tirap** **and**


-----

**Changlang): The situation though under**

control, remains dynamic as a result of the turf

war presently underway between NSCN (IM)

and NSCN (Khaplang).

3.20 **Tripura and Mizoram: The situation**

is under control, however, the delay in

repatriation of Brus/ Reangs from the refugee

camps in Tripura to Mizoram remains a future

potential flash point.

3.21 **Meghalaya: Activities of Garo National**

Liberation Army in the Garo Hills have

increased and needs monitoring.

###### Situation Along the Borders

3.22 **Bilateral Relations with  China:**

Relations between the two nations have

improved over the past few years. Positive

engagements at the political and diplomatic

level are continuing with limited military to

military interactions as well. Both nations have

appointed Special Representatives to explore

the framework of a boundary settlement

from the political perspective of the bilateral

relationship.

3.23 China has focused itself towards

building its Comprehensive National Power

(CNP) by economic development and technical

up-gradation, which in turn has provided

requisite impetus to modernisation of her Armed

Forces and force projection capability. Chinese

footprints in India’s immediate neighbourhood

are increasing progressively due to its proactive

diplomacy through political, military and

economic cooperation and engagements.


China’s rising power supported by burgeoning

economy is reflected in its increased confidence

which will have an impact on regional and

international security contours and power

equations. Rapid infrastructure development in

Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) and Xinjiang

Province has considerably upgraded China’s

military force projection and application

capability against India and improved their

overall strategic and operational flexibility.

3.24 **Our Focus: Indian Army is fully seized of**

the security needs of the country as well as the

requirement of development of infrastructure

in the border areas. Necessary steps as required

have been initiated for the upgradation of our

infrastructure and force structuring to secure

the desired national security objectives along

the Northern borders. A holistic review of

our infrastructural development and military

modernisation programme has been undertaken

in consonance with the overall Border Areas

Development Programme. Strategically

important infrastructure requirements along

the Line of Actual Control (LAC) have been

identified and are being developed in a phased

manner.

3.25 **Way Ahead:** India always desires

peaceful and cordial relations with all

neighbours, including China. To this end, a

policy of positive engagement and maintaining

peace and tranquility along the LAC is ensured.

Concurrently necessary development of

infrastructure and military preparedness to

include force modernisation continues to meet

the present and future security challenges.

###### INDIAN ARMY IN UN PEACEKEEPING OPERATIONS

3.53 As a founder member of the United
Nations, India has been a strong supporter
of the ideals and principles of the United
Nations. India has been an active contributor
to all UN organs since its inception and is one
of the largest military and police contributors
to UN Peacekeeping Operations. India first
deployed its troops in UN peacekeeping
operations in 1950 with the deployment of 60
Field Ambulance consisting of 346 personnel
in Korea.

3.54 Since 1950 India has participated in 45
UN missions out of the total of 69 UN missions,
across the globe. Till date, more than 1,65,000
Indian troops have participated in various UN
Missions.

3.55 The most significant contribution of
Indian Army has been to ensure peace and
stability in Africa and parts of Asia. It has
demonstrated a unique capacity of sustaining
large troop commitments over prolonged
periods. Towards the fulfillment of India’s
commitment to the UN and peace, 136
Indian soldiers have so far made the supreme
sacrifice.

3.56 **Leadership in UNPKO: India has so far**
provided 13 Force Commanders in various UN
Missions. Lt. General KS Thimayya was the first
Indian officer to be appointed as the Chairman
of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission
(NNRC) in Korea in 1950. Presently, Lt.
General Chander Prakash, SM, VSM is serving


-----

as the Force Commander of MONUSCO in
Congo. Besides the Force Commanders, India
also had the honour of providing one Division
Commander, five Deputy Force Commanders
and two Military Advisors to the Secretary
General of the United Nations.

3.57 **Our Present Contribution: India has**
also contributed a sizeable strength of troops
for the UN peacekeeping operations. Presently
we have 7099 persons (approximately) in
various UN missions. Our present contribution
is as follows:

(a) **MONUSCO: Congo (1999 – till**
**date): India’s contribution to MONUSCO**
commenced with the deputation of military
Observers in 1999. With increased demands
for troops contribution, India has deployed
an Infantry Brigade Group with four Infantry
Battalion Groups, Brigade Signal Company and
a Level III hospital in Congo since November
2004. An Army Aviation Flt has also been
deployed in the mission area w.e.f. 2009.
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is the
second largest country in the African Continent
and has faced protracted period of unrest and
instability since its independence in 1960; a
period, characterized by two civil wars and
ethnic conflicts. The operating conditions for
the Indian brigade here are challenging, replete
with inhospitable terrain and adverse climatic
conditions. The brigade is mandated to carry
out protection of civilians which is the primary
role. The North Kivu Brigade has contributed
significantly towards implementation of the
MONUSCO Mandate and is regarded extremely
favorable by the international community. The
entire infrastructure, security management
and activities of MONUSCO in the province
are dependent on the Brigade. The formation


faced many challenges towards execution of its
tasks and achievement of operational goals in
terms of protection of civilians, surrenders and
area domination. The brigade undertook many
operations during this period mainly to ensure
protection of civilian and successful conduct of
the presidential and provincial elections. Few
of the important operations were, OPERATION
JUA MUPIA, OPERATION RESTORE HOPE,
OPERATION BIRDS EYE AND OPERATION
DEVINE FORCE. OPERATION BLUE FIST was
launched by the brigade to successfully bring
to an end the armed group clashes in the area
of Kimua. This operation was a huge success
and it proved the ability of the Indian soldiers
to operate under a multinational environment.
The North Kivu Brigade took great initiatives for
alleviating the suffering of the local Congolese.
Various humanitarian activities were launched,
e.g. the Catch them Young activity to positively
engage the young minds in the AOR. The
Units of the brigade executed many **Quick**
**impact projects worth about** **US$ 73535.00**
to facilitate the local population. North Kivu
Brigade facilitated surrenders of **398 cadres,**
**228 child soldiers & 288 dependents in year**
2011 through its bases, thereby encouraging
restoration of normalcy in the region.

(b) **UNFIL: Lebanon (1998 – till date):**
The Indian Army’s contribution to UNIFIL
includes one Infantry Battalion Group, one
Level I Hospital and Staff Officers. INDBATT
Area of Operations (AO) is in the Eastern part
of the UNIFIL AO. The Battalion is deployed in
mountainous terrain and INDBATT XIV has an
AO of approximately 100 sq kms. INDBATT XIV
is carrying out intensive operational activities
in its AO. INDBATT is holding 10 UN position
apart from 9 Temporary Observation Posts


-----

(Ops) along the blue Line, which is the highest
number of posts held by a single unit in entire
UNFIL AOR, thus dominating the Blue Line
against any violation of the line of withdrawal
between Lebanon and Israel occupied Cheeba
Farms Area, thereby monitoring and reporting
promptly any violation. The battalion has been
successful in maintaining peace and stability
in its AO through relentless patrolling activities
which includes a daily schedule of 26 day/
night patrols in the battalion AOR including
Counter Rocket Launching Operations
(CRLOs) and blue Line Patrols in close
coordination with Lebanese Armed Forces.
The Indian Army INDBATT-XIV organized a
large number of activities to include medical,
dental and veterinary camps on regular basis,
so as to provide succor and solace to the
local population. Due to aid, a close contact
and special rapport has been achieved with
the local population which further assists in
achievement of operational tasks.

(c) **UNMIS: Sudan (April 2005 till July 9,**
**2011): Contribution to Sudan was initially in**
the form of two infantry battalion group, a sector
HQ, a Force Signal Company, a Construction
Engineer Company, IAF contingent and a Level
II Hospital. The mission was closed down in
July 2011.

(d) **UNMISS (South Sudan): The UN**
Mission in Sudan (UNMIS) was closed down
on July 9, 2011 and the UN HQ opened a
new mission viz UNMISS (South Sudan).
Government of India approved sidestepping
the Indian Army contingents which were
deployed in UNMIS (Sudan) to UNMISS (South
Sudan). The Indian Army contingents have
commenced operations in support of the UN
Security Council mandate for UNMISS. The


mission is presently under stabilization phase.
On July 9, 2011, the independent State of
Republic of South Sudan (RoSS) was formed in
a complex and fragile regional environment.
UNMISS intervention resulted in resolution of
dispute between SPLA and RMGs undergoing
re-integration, regarding retention of weapons.
However, there is still significant distrust
between the two parties.

(e) **UNDOF:** **Golan Heights – Israel**
**(January 2006 till date): In Golan Heights**
India has deployed a logistic contingent as part
of UNDOF which is responsible for providing
second line logistic support to the mission. The
Indian contingent has been part of UNDOF
since 2006 when it replaced the Canadian
contingent.

(f) **UNMIT: Timor Leste: To the Mission**
in Timor Leste, India has provided only one
Staff Officer. Although the contribution is not
significantly large, it is consistent.

3.58 Till date 136 Indian peacekeepers have
made the supreme sacrifice while serving in UN
peacekeeping operations. In recognition of their
gallant and distinguished service while serving
the noble cause of world peace, members of
Indian Army peacekeeping contingents have
won the following awards:

#### The Indian Navy (IN) has been playing a maritime
###### leadership role in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) due to its multi-dimensional capabilities and active presence in the region


4.1 The Indian Navy (IN) has been playing

a maritime leadership role in the Indian Ocean

Region (IOR) due to its multi-dimensional

capabilities and active presence in the region.

The IN faces an operating environment of

ferment, due to a variety of factors which

include geo-politics, geo-economics, emerging

technologies, changing nature of asymmetric

threat and continuously evolving capabilities

in our maritime neighbourhood. Consequently,

the IN’s force planning and operational

philosophy is designed to address likely threats

and opportunities, with the overall aim of

protecting our national maritime interests.

4.2 As India continues its progress on the

path of sustained economic growth, there

is a growing acceptance of the fact that the

maritime domain is the prime facilitator of our

development. More than 90% of our trade by

volume and 77% by value are transported over

the seas. Over 97% of our energy needs of oil

are either imported or produced from offshore

fields. Consequently, our economic growth is

inextricably linked to the seas.

4.3 The IN is being increasingly called

upon to address issues pertaining to safety,

security and stability in the region. As a


responsible nation and a benign maritime

neighbour, enforcement of international laws,

humanitarian assistance and disaster relief in

the Indian Ocean Region would continue to

remain in the forefront of our international

commitments. The complex maritime security

environment in the IOR requires the IN to

maintain a high level of operational tempo

and readiness at all times. Besides a large

number of operational deployments, the IN

has successfully undertaken exercises with

navies of friendly foreign countries. These

exercises have helped in strengthening bilateral

relationships, cementing our professional ties

and streamlining inter-operability issues.

4.4 Piracy continues to remain a major area

of concern in the IOR. During its anti-piracy

patrols, the IN has done a commendable job in

thwarting a number of attacks on Indian and

foreign merchant ships, over the past year. Our

continued presence in pirate infested area has

demonstrated our commitment and resolve to

the maritime world to deal with this threat. The

role and responsibility of the IN to protect our

maritime interests will continue to grow with

the requirement to safeguard our expanding

economic interests as also the leadership


-----

responsibilities associated with being a mature

and responsible regional maritime power.

4.5 The IN has wholeheartedly supported

indigenisation programmes, in consonance

with our overall national vision of sustained

Induction of Indigenous Stealth Frigate - INS Shivalik

growth and self-reliance. It is a matter of

significant achievement that the modernisation

programme of the IN is focused towards

indigenous warship construction. Our preferred

choice is for inducting ships and submarines

through the indigenous route. Consequently,

of the 48 ships and submarines presently on

order, 44 are being built in Indian shipyards,

with the latest P-28 ASW Corvettes planned for

an indigenous content of over 90%.

authority responsible for overall maritime

security, which includes coastal security and

offshore security of the country. To meet this

task, the IN has undertaken brown water

operations along with blue water operations

to safeguard our coastline from threats. A

coordinated effort has been made to strengthen

necessary linkages with all Ministries/ agencies

and coastal States/ Union Territories to

achieve synergy for effective coastal security

management. Six of the 15 Fast Interceptor

Craft (FIC) planned to be inducted for coastal

security have already been inducted in the IN

in 2010.

4.24 From January 2009 there has been

an increase of 60-80% in the deployment of


-----

IN  ships and 100% increase in IN aircraft

deployment for coastal security tasking.

Surveillance of the ODAs has also been

enhanced. Several exercises and coastal

security operations have been undertaken so

far in support of coastal security. Integration of

fishermen as one of the stakeholders of maritime

security has been addressed from the grass-root

level. So far, 361 awareness campaigns have

been conducted with the aim of increasing the

awareness of the fishing community to act as

eyes and ears for coastal security.

4.25 Better inter-agency coordination has

been one of the positive outcomes of the

progress made in last few years. This has been

facilitated by the conduct of regular coastal

security exercises conducted with all maritime

stakeholders. Successful joint operations and


investigation of a number of illegal vessels off

our coastline are a visible result of effective

coordination between all concerned agencies.

###### PRESIDENT’S FLEET REVIEW

#### With the induction of women in various non###### combatant branches of the Armed Forces like logistics and law, a larger role is envisaged for them


17.1 The role of women has been increasing

steadily in the field of national defence. Women

are employed in Defence Production Units,

Defence Research & Development Laboratories

and as Doctors and Nursing Officers in the

Armed Forces. With the induction of women in

various non-combatant branches of the Armed

Forces like logistics and law, a larger role is

envisaged for them.

###### INDIAN ARMY

17.2 **Women Officers in the Army: Women**

officers have been serving in the Armed

Forces for about 80 years and have served

with competence and distinction. They were

inducted in the Military Nursing Service in

1927 and in the Medical Officers cadre since

1943. In the Armed Forces Medical Services,

there are both permanent and Short Service

Commission Officers.

17.3 In a significant step which would

attract more women in the Army, the tenure of

Women Officers in Short Service Commission

has been increased from 10 years to 14 years

of service. Besides, their promotional avenues

have been substantially enhanced. Earlier, they

were eligible for only one promotion, viz.,


to the rank of Major after 5 years of service.

Women Short Service Commission Officers

in the Army are now granted time-scale

substantive promotions to the rank of Captain,

Major and Lt. Colonel Rank after 2, 6 and 13

years of reckonable service respectively. This

is at par with the promotions available to the

Permanent Commission Officers. In addition,

with a view to ensuring gender equality, the

training period of women officers in the Army in

Short Service Commission has been increased

from 24 weeks to 49 weeks, to be at par with

male Short Service Commission Officers.

17.4 The future policy on induction and

employment of women in Armed Forces has

been enunciated in November, 2011, keeping

in view the role and responsibility of the Armed

Forces in defending the nation and protecting

the territorial Integrity of the country, as

_Appendix-III_

###### Brief of C&AG’s Audit Report No. 11 of 2011-12, Union Government (Defence Services) on Adarsh Cooperative Housing Society (ACHS) – Mumbai.


**Main audit findings of the Report were as**
**under:**

- The case of Adarsh Co-operative Housing
Society, Mumbai has been engaging the
National Headlines. This C&AG’s Audit
Report places documentary evidence

of how a group of select officials could
subvert rules and regulations in the name
of Kargil Heroes, welfare of war widows,
Ex-servicemen, welfare of soldiers, etc.,
to grab prime Government land in the
heart of Mumbai. The agencies inter-alia
included Defence offices, Departments
and Agencies of Government of
Maharashtra and Ministry of Environment
and Forests, Government of India.

- Facts of the case gathered from records
of Government of Maharashtra as
also Defence Estates Office Mumbai
conclusively prove that the land was in
possession of Army, a fact that the officials
of Government of Maharashtra, HQ M&G
area and Defence Estates Office should
have been aware of, but probably chose
to ignore. The title to the land however
was not clear as it was never formally
transferred to the Ministry of Defence.

- The Society was originally formed
to primarily help “Servicemen, Exservicemen and their widows”, as events
unfolded, its membership was expanded


considerably to include officers of the
Indian Administrative Service, politicians
and their relations and other senior
Service Officers. As of December 2010
the Society had 102 members.

**Changing composition of members of the**
**Society**

2000 40 0 40

2002 38 33 71

2003 45 50 95

2010 37 65 102

- The flouting of norms in the case was not
only restricted to wrongful appropriation
of government land. Almost at every stage,
significant concessions were extended
by the Government of Maharashtra in
favour of the Society. Many officers-both
civilian and Services – who were dealing
with the case and were instrumental in
taking those decisions eventually became
members of the Society. In some cases,
relations of these officers became the
members.

- To accommodate the Society, the
MMRDA Development Plan for the area
was amended and the area reserved for
roads was converted into residential
area.

|Year|Defence including related civilian organisation|Other than Defence|Total Members|
|---|---|---|---|
|2000|40|0|40|
|2002|38|33|71|
|2003|45|50|95|
|2010|37|65|102|


-----

- The misappropriation of the land in
possession of the Army was compounded
by transfer of FSI of another piece of
public land i.e. adjoining plot of 2669.68
sq metres used by BEST as approach road
to its depot.

- Further relaxation was extended to grant
additional FSI in lieu of Recreation
Ground (RG). Society forwarded
additional names “to be accommodated
in Adarsh Co-operative Housing Society
if the additional FSI is sanctioned by
the Government.” The Chief Minister
approved the proposal to exclude 15%
RG area from FSI computation.

- The norms for High Rise Buildings were
violated. The maximum height of the
Society building permissible as per the
applicable Development Control Rules
(DCR) 1967 was 45.6 metres. The Society
was allowed to construct 28 floors and
the total height of the building is 107.55
metres.

- The eligibility conditions were relaxed in
favour of the members, Government of
Maharashtra in February 2005 amended
the provisions of the Government
Resolution of July 1999 by raising the
income limit of all and waiving the
requirement of domicile in respect of
retired State Government employees and
serving and retired service personnel from
Maharashtra allowed hitherto ineligible
members to become eligible.



- Despite the existence of several agencies
like Department of Environment in
Government of Maharashtra, the
Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management
Authority, and the Ministry of Environment
and Forests (MoEF) in the Government of
India, a building more than 100 metres tall
could come up within a few kilometres of
Mantralaya in Mumbai without requisite
clearance and also receive an occupancy
certificate from the concerned local

authorities.

- The Ministry of Environment and Forests,
Government of India failed to draw
attention of the State Government to
the extant provisions regarding Coastal
Regulation Zone Notification. It is
communication created adequate context
to allow the Government of Maharashtra
to interpret it as a ‘No Objection’ to the
proposed residential development by the
Society and thus use it as “environmental
clearance” from the MoEF.

###### Brief on the Performance Audit of Defence Estates Management [C&AG’s Report No. 35 of 2010-11, Union Government (Defence Services)]


The Ministry of Defence is the biggest
landholder in the Government with a holding
of 17.31 lakh acres of land. The responsibility
for management of land at the apex level
rests with the Ministry of Defence and with
the Directorate General of Defence Estates
(DGDE). With growing urbanization, in most
of the cities the Cantonment and station areas

are almost at the heart of the city now. Much
of the Defence land both inside and outside
Cantonment is now prime real estate.

**Main audit findings of the Report were as**
**under:**

- There was lack of any focal point in
management of Defence land. The MOD
has only one section to deal with vast
number of cases, which is inadequate.
Besides, lines of responsibilities were
also blurred on many aspects of Defence
Estates management, with none of the
agencies involved coming forward to

accept responsibility.

- The application of land norms of
requirements of land for different Defence
establishments was not found to be
uniform. On application of 1991’s norms
for new Military Stations to 39 existing
Military stations, Audit observed that the
existing stations held excess land to the
tune of 81,814.82 acres.

- There were large scale discrepancies
in the figures of A-1 land as per Local


Military Authorities and that in the
records of the DEOs who are responsible
for keeping land record. Lack of survey
and inspection of land carries the risk of
encroachment and land grab which have
become quite common as pointed out in
the report.

- A large area of acquired land was
awaiting mutation for periods ranging
from 1 year to over 60 years. For example,
13.39 percent of land held on records
of 11 DEOs was not mutated in favour
of the Ministry. DGDE, too, failed to
keep centralized record on the status of
mutation.

- The Ministry in December 1992
instructed the DGDE to conduct land
audit to rationalise and maximize the
use of existing land holdings for Defence
purposes. Army HQ, however, were not
agreeable to the continuance of land
audit and conveyed to the Ministry that
further audit might not be conducted.
The DGDE also allowed the mechanism
of land audit to lapse.

- Long delays were observed in acquisition
of land. In three Commands, 10 cases
of land acquisition were completed by
DEOs/ADEO with delays ranging from
one to eight years. During the review of
49 cases, where acquisition is in progress
in four Army and two Air Force and Naval


-----

Commands each, Audit noticed that 15
cases were 1-5 years old, 12 cases 6-10
years old, 15 cases 11-20 years old and
6 cases over 20 years old with the status
of one case being not made known. Final
declarations of awards in respect of 21
cases were awaited even after issue of
Government sanctions pertaining to the
period from November 1979 to June
2003. Despite deposit of land cost of
Rs. 56.24 crore in respect of 18 cases

between December 1986 and March
2009, the acquisition proceedings were
still incomplete.

- The Defence land remains to be constantly
under commercial exploitation since
long. The practice of allowing Shopping
Complexes on Defence land and
crediting the revenue earned from them
to Regimental Funds, which are outside
the Parliamentary oversight, continued
to be unabated. Follow up of the cases
already reported in various Audit Reports
indicated that very little change had taken

place in the situation on the ground.
A number of case were, for example,
reported in Paragraph 2.5 of C&AG’s
Report No. 6 of 2003 on exploitation of
defence land for shopping complexes and
diversion of revenue from public fund.

- There has been lack of action on
abandoned land. Scrutiny of the records
of the Ministry and DGDE indicated that
an area of 25,888.81 acres of Abandoned
Airfields (AAFs) and Camping Grounds
(CGs) in five Commands had been lying


surplus to the need of armed forces since
1980, which had neither been disposed
of nor put to any alternative use.
7,499.39 acres had been encroached
upon. The encroachment on such land in
all the Commands varied between 16.10
percent and 38.96 percent.

- The area of encroachment of Defence land
increased from 6,903 acres in January
1997 to 14,539.38 acres in July 2009.
Neither were inspection of land being
carried out by any authority and required
certificates rendered by Defence Estates
Officers, nor were the Ministry and DGDE
monitoring the progress of inspection or
of investigations about the circumstances
leading to fresh encroachments.

- Though Golf is not an authorised activity,
there were 97 Golf Courses under the
Army with an area of at least 8076.94
acres. Golf Courses on A-1 Defence land
were being operated by Army Zone Golf,
a private registered society. The members
of the club were not only service personnel

but ex-servicemen, civilians and foreign
nationals as well. Huge revenues were
being earned without paying any rent
for use of Government assets. Revenue
generated was not credited to Government
account and was presumably credited to
Regimental Fund.

- The Defence land was being used
unauthorizedly for Parks and Clubs.
At Agra, Lucknow, Secunderabad and
Pune, 122.58 acres of Defence land


-----

had been leased out to various clubs at
nominal rates. Land was being utilized
for unauthorized purposes like marriages,
parties, exhibitions etc. Recovery of Rs.
2.14 crore, for the year 2004-05 to 200910, was outstanding against the clubs.

- The state of management of leases was
so dismal in that 2500 acres of Defence
land valuing Rs. 11,033 crore was on
lease for an annual rent Rs. 2.13 crore,
which is negligible given the present
market value of the land. There was no
progress in renewal of 3780 leases and in
1800 cases, there was no pursuance for
eviction of lessees.



- In contravention of the Ministry’s land
policy, numerous cases of unauthorized
sale/ transfer of Bungalows on Old
Grant sites (OGBs), use of OGBs for
commercial purposes like marriage halls
and hotel/ restaurant were seen. 92
cases for resumption of sites referred to
the Ministry were awaiting sanction for
a period ranging from one to seven years
and in respect of 65 cases, resumption
notices were pending with the Ministry

for a period ranging from two to seven
years.

###### Report No.24 of 2011-12: Union Government (Defence Services) Army and Ordnance Factories


**II Ministry of Defence**

**Para 2.1: Delay in induction of state-of –the**

**–art Artillery Guns**

Failure of the Ministry of Defence and Army

in defining the requirement of specific gun

system had deprived its Artillery, for over a

decade, of guns of latest technology, which are

in service world over. The abnormal delay in

procurement of the state-of-the-art technology

gun replacing the existing guns of obsolete

technology of 1970, had not only impacted the

operational preparedness of the Army but also

resulted in substantial cost overrun.

**Para 2.2: Delay in establishment of repair**

**facility (Mini Depot) and unwanted import**

**of Trailers**

Advance payment of Rs.100.18 crore had been

made to the United States Government (USG)

between March 2008 and October 2009 to

establish Mini Depot for repair of 12 Weapon

Locating Radars (WLRs) by September 2010.

No progress had been made towards setting up

of repair facility by due date. Consequently, a

number of WLR remained non-functional for

want of repairs. Besides, incorrect analysis

of requirement of support equipments for the

WLRs led to unwanted procurement of twelve

Trailers at a cost of Rs.2.19 crore.


**Para 2.3: Failure of the project “Mission Excel**

**Information Technology (MEIT)”**

The project “Mission Excel Information

Technology(MEIT)” of Defence Accounts

Department (DAD) planned with the objectives

of automation of every function of DAD was

derailed from its path in spite of incurring

expenditure of Rs.20.47 crore. The intended

objectives of automation of all functions

of DAD remain unachieved even after four

years.

###### III ARMY

**Para 3.1: Extra expenditure due to acceptance**

**of higher rates.**

Director General National Cadet Corps

(DGNCC) violated the provisions of General

financial Rules and Defence Procurement

Manual (DPM) while procuring mosquito nets

for its Cadets. By adopting incorrect practice

of purchasing 80 per cent quantity from past

suppliers at higher rates than that of L-1 firm,

extra expenditure of Rs.21 crore had been

incurred.

**Para** **3.2:** **Diversion** **of** **funds** **from**

**Government into non-Government account**

**for procurement of Personal Kit items.**

Army HQ had set up a commercial outlet

in the name of Personal Kit Store (PKS UN)


-----

without approval of the Ministry. Through this

outlet, transaction of Government stores worth

Rs.140.75 crore were carried out for last three

years. Stores for PKS (UN) were procured by

diverting funds from Government into non
Government Account and Army had charged

service charges of Rs.5.36 crore irregularly.

**Para 3.11: Irregular payment to Civil Hired**

**Transport Contractors**

Irregular payment of Rs. 32.29 lakh had been

made to the Civil Hired Transport Contractors

due to dubious booking of Civil Hired Transport

by two Ordnance depots for conveyance of

ordnance stores to dependent units.

**IV** **Works and Military Engineer Services**

**Para 4.1: Overpayment in Electricity Bills**

Overpayment of Rs.1.63 core had been made

to the electricity supplying agencies due to

application of incorrect tariff schedule or

failure to intimate correct contracted maximum

demand (CMD) by the Military Engineer

Service.

**V** **BORDER ROADS ORGANISATION**

**Para5.2:** **Non-completion of bridge after**

**twelve years of sanction**

Improper planning and supervision of works

resulted in non-completion of the bridge on

a river in Uttarakhand after 12 years despite

spending Rs.3.54 crore.


**VI** **DEFENCE** **RESEARCH** **AND**

**DEVELOPMENT ORGANISATION**

**Para 6.1:** **Blockage of public money due**

**to take over of unusable land**

Defence Research and Development

Organisation (DRDO) acquired 407 acres of

forest land at Faridabad for Rs.73.26 crore

in April 2008 to set up a centre.  The land

could not be used for construction activities

as diversion of land for non-forestry purpose

was not permitted by the Central Empowered

Committee (CEC).

**Para 6.3** **Development of a Modular**

**Bridge below requisite specifications**

Against the users’ requirement of modular

bridge of 46 metre span with Military Load

Class (MLC)-70, DRDO developed 40 metre

span MLC-70 modular bridge by spending

Rs. 21.46 crore. The Army did not accept the

bridge being below requisite specifications and

their requirement of modular bridge remains

unfulfilled for nine years.

**VII** **PROJECT** **MANAGEMENT** **IN**

**ARMAMENT RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT**

**ESTABLISHMENT**

**Chapter 7:** **Project** **Management** **in**

**Armament** **Research** **and** **Development**

**Establishment (ARDE)**

Scrutiny of staff projects undertaken by ARDE

during last 15 years, revealed that out of 46

closed Staff projects, only 13 underwent


-----

production while in the remaining either no

production was required or claims of success

could not be substantiated. Many of the projects

failed as these were taken up without firming

up the General Staff Qualitative Requirements

(GSQR) or frequent changes in Qualitative

Requirements were made by the users.

Excessive time overrun and non-acceptance of

the final output by the users also led to closure

of the projects. In many cases, delays and

failures led to dependence on imports.

**VIII** **ORDNANCE** **FACTORIES**

**ORGANISATION**

**Para 8.2:** **Extra expenditure due to delay**

**in finalization of a purchase agreement**

Abnormal delay in firming up an offer

collectively by the Heavy Vehicles Factory

Avadi, Armoured Vehicles Headquarters

Avadi and Ministry of Defence despite being

aware of the availability of a machine from

only one source led to its procurement at an

avoidable extra expenditure of Rs. 1.36 crore

after obtaining fresh offers.

**Para 8.4:** **Undue benefit to a firm**

Ordnance Factory Ambernath extended an

undue benefit of Rs. 9.77 crore to the Minerals

and Metals Trading Corporation Mumbai owing

to the factory’s failure to insist upon supply of

the outstanding quantity of copper cathodes at

London Metal Exchange rates of February 2007

as per the supply order and accepting the same

at higher rates of May 2007.


**Para 8.5:** **Avoidable import of propellant**

Ordnance Factory Khamaria provided

incorrect information to the Ordnance Factory

Board about stock balance of propellants of

an ammunition, which resulted in avoidable

import of propellant valuing Rs. 2.17 crore

and extra expenditure of Rs. 39.79 lakh when

compared with cost of production of the item

at Ordnance Factory Bhandara.

**Summary of Important Audit observations –**

**Ministry of Defence**

**Report No. 20 of 2011-12 (Air Force and**

**Navy)**

**I.** **Delayed acquisition of armaments for a**

**frontline fighter aircraft**

Flawed approach in acquiring 16 MiG-29K

aircraft, at a cost of Rs. 3,405.61 crore without

finalising the associated package with the

procurement of the aircraft, in January 2004,

led to delivery of six aircraft in December 2009

without weapons. Subsequently, five more

aircrafts were delivered in May 2011. The

armament for the aircraft were contracted for

only in March 2006 which led to non delivery

of weapons till October 2010, adversely

affecting the operational capabilities of the

aircraft. Besides, the Beyond Visual Range

missiles contracted for the aircraft, at a cost

of Rs. 93.68 crore, has had an unsatisfactory

track record with Indian Air Force.

**_(Paragraph 2.1)_**


-----

**II.** **Extra expenditure on procurement of**

**Low Level Transportable Radar**

Acquisition of critical requirement of air defence

surveillance system was beset with delays
at each stage in the pre-contract finalisation
process. Further avoidable additional payment
of Rs. 57.46 crore was made by the Ministry
to M/s Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL) without
justification due to inadequate negotiations
during procurement.

**_(Paragraph 2.2)_**

**III.** **Extra expenditure on operation of a**
**surveillance system**

Indian Air Force procured two vital surveillance
systems at the cost of Rs. 676 crore. One of the
system met with an accident and has become
non operational since May 2009. It is not likely
to be available to IAF for another two years.
The accident was attributable to failure in
keeping track of weather changes, inadequate
supervision of the ongoing snubbing activities
and follow up on maintenance activities.
Besides, the fabric used in both the systems
have also started decaying prematurely causing
excessive leakage of helium resulting in extra
expenditure on operation cost.

**_(Paragraph 2.3)_**

**IV** **Procurement** **of** **unsuitable**
**communication sets**

Air Defence V/UHF links play a vital role in
all air operations. Ministry /IAF accepted
communication equipment, designed and
developed by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited


(HAL), even though the equipment did not
meet technical requirements. Despite spending
Rs.116 crore and considerable period of time,
IAF’s critical requirement for communication
equipment is yet to be fulfilled.

**_(Paragraph 2.4)_**

**V** **Abnormal delay in procurement of**
**Precision Approach Radar**

Indian Navy inordinately delayed the
procurement of Precision Approach Radar
resulting in an additional expenditure of Rs.
2.01 crore over and above the initial quote.
The radar intended to be purchased on fast
track basis was commissioned in April 2009,
eight years after initiating the procurement
process. Post commissioning, the performance
of the radar has been erratic.

**_(Paragraph 2.5)_**

**VI** **Delay in procurement of urgent aviation**
**stores through Indian embassies**

Procurement of critical and urgent aviation
stores/spares through Indian Embassies was

beset with delays at each stage. The decisionmaking even at Air HQ was slow and led
to delay in conclusion of contacts. The
contract delivery schedules were significantly
longer, thereby, undermining the urgency of
procurement.

**_(Paragraph 2.7)_**

**VII Avoidable expenditure on procurement**
**of spares**

Failure in placement of supply order under


-----

option clause resulted in an avoidable
expenditure of Rs.4.29 crore in the subsequent
procurement of spares. Besides, due to delay
in procurement, established infrastructure
remained idle for want of spares for
considerable time.

**_(Paragraph 3.1)_**

**VIII Unfruitful expenditure on procurement**
**of flare cartridges**

Out of 20,000 flares procured for use on the
MiG 21 Bison aircraft upgradation project,
19,540 flares costing Rs. 3.09 crore exhausted
their shelf life of seven years in store. Thus
procurement of flares was rendered unfruitful
due to expiry of flare cartridge before being
placed with operating squadrons, where they
could have been put to use.

**_(Paragraph 3.2)_**

**IX** **Avoidable expenditure in procurement**
**of spares for a helicopter**

There was abnormal delay in processing the
case for procurement of spares for KA-31

helicopters. Further, Indian Navy’s failure
of to get the validity of the quote of a firm
extended resulted in an avoidable expenditure
of Rs.10.71 crore.

**_(Paragraph 4.1)_**

**X** **Avoidable expenditure in procurement**
**of Winch Reel Hydraulic**

Lack of due diligence by the Tender Evaluation
Committee at the initial stage in processing
of tenders for procurement of Winch Reel


Hydraulic led to delay in procurement and an
avoidable expenditure of Rs.9.73 crore.

**_(Paragraph 4.2)_**

**XI** **Extra expenditure in procurement of Gas**
**Turbines**

Breaking up the procurement order of nine
gas turbines by Indian Navy led to an extra
expenditure of Rs.2.49 crore as the subsequent
procurement of five gas turbines was at a higher
cost.

**_(Paragraph 4.3)_**

**XII** **Inordinate delay in installation of SPL**
**Plotting Tables on submarines**

SPL Plotting Table is a navigation and tactical
system which can plot the ships own position
as well as it can plot the data received from the
unit sensors. Four SPL Plotting Tables procured
at a cost of Rs.6.05 crore could not be installed
onboard the submarines for about four years
after their receipt. Continued disuse meant
that, these Plotting Tables lost their warranty
cover in September 2008 without these being

utilised.

**_(Paragraph 4.4)_**

**XIII Tardy progress in execution of a Water**
**Supply Scheme**

There was an inordinate delay on part of
the Military Engineer Services (MES) for over
seven years in execution/ commissioning of
Water Supply Scheme at Visakhapatnam. The
expenditure of Rs. 4.53 crore did not serve


-----

the objective of providing adequate and clean
water to Defence Personnel.

**_(Paragraph 4.6)_**

**XIV Loss of stores in transit**

Failure of Aeronautical Development
Establishment (ADE) to comply with the extant
orders for insuring against loss or damage in
transit resulted in a transit loss of stores worth
Rs. 10.63 crore meant for Light Combat Aircraft
(LCA) programme.

**_(Paragraph 5.1)_**

**XV** **Savings/ recoveries at the instance of**
**audit**

An amount of Rs. 1.31 crore was recovered/
adjusted in two cases in respect of Navy and
Rs. 31.56 crore in three cases in respect of Air
Force was saved only after having been pointed
out by audit.

**_(Paragraph 3.6 and 4.10)_**

**Ministry of Defence**

**Audit Report No. CA 3 of 2011-12**

**Bharat Electronics Limited**

**Para 7.1** Loss in manufacture and
supply of satellite radio receivers. Contract
manufacturing of Satellite Radios and supply
without agreement with the collaborator
resulted in a loss of Rs. 16.39 crore.

**BEML Limited**

**Para No. 7.2 Sale** of Dealer Model
Equipment


Though the Company had been in the business
of mining and construction equipment since
1964 and enjoyed 12 % market share in respect
of construction equipment, the Company’s
market share in respect of DME (small end
construction equipment) was around one
per cent only till 2009-10 and was facing
severe competition from both domestic and
international suppliers in this segment.

To establish brand image and get reasonable
market share, the Company decided (July
2006) to establish wider dealership network
throughout the country to have maximum
access to the customers located in interior
areas. A review of dealership network of the
Company in Audit revealed the following:

Despite growth in construction/ infrastructure
activities in the recent years, the Company
failed to capitalize on the potential for small
end equipment.

Quality of DME supplied by the Company and
after-sales service was poor resulting in return
of equipment by the customers. This created

negative image for the Company’s products.

The Company had dispatched equipment
to dealers without valid orders and also not
considered the market realities resulting in
piling up of inventories and consequent locking
up of funds.

**Para 7.3** Failure to safeguard interest of the
Company in selection of a Joint Venture
partner.

Failure to ensure business and financial
credentials of the JV partner resulted in unfruitful


-----

investment of Rs. 6.94 crore besides impending
threat of invoking Corporate Guarantee of Rs.
19.15 crore.

**Hindustan Aeronautics Limited**

**Para 7.4** IT Audit on Implementation of
Industrial Finance System with specific thrust
on Material Management module.

Hindustan Aeronautics Limited implemented

Industrial Finance System (IFS) an ERP
package with the objective of implementing

uniform procedure and practices, on-line

information for decision making, integration

and inter-operable systems amongst divisions

eliminating isolated islands of automation. A

review of IFS implementation with specific

thrust on Material Management Module in

Engine division, Bangalore and Nashik division

was taken up. Delays in implementation were

noticed due to absence of Business process

Re-engineering combined with inexperience

of the implementer. Flaws in system design,

non-mapping of various business processes,

non-cleansing of data before migration,

absence of validation checks combined with

manual interventions resulted in incomplete

and unreliable data and further led to non
achievement of the intended benefits as per

Project Quality Document.

**Para 7.5** Setting up dedicated

manufacturing facilities without firm

commitment.

The decision of the Company to set up dedicated

facilities for undertaking export orders without


firm commitment or equity participation with

P&WC was injudicious, resulting in blocking

up of funds to the tune of Rs. 53.57 crore and

infructuous expenditure to the tune of Rs.

46.97 crore.

**Audit Report No. PA 4 of 2011-12**

**Bharat Electronics Limited**

**Procurement system in Bharat Electronics**

**Limited**

Audit examination revealed certain

inadequacies in the system and procedures of

purchase, vendor development and tendering

process. Some of the significant audit findings

are discussed below:
***** **Thin vendor base**

The company was operating on a thin vendor

base, as for almost one third of the standard

items, it had only one vendor while for

another one third of these items, it had only

two vendors. In fact, the Company could add

only 168 vendors to its directory during the

last three years which accounted for only one

per cent of the total vendors of the Company.

Thus, in the absence of an adequate vender

base for procuring a large number of items, the

Company’s ability to obtain competitive rates

was impaired.

***** **Non-sharing of vendor base**

Vendor base of the Company was unit specific

and was not being shared among units while

inviting quotations. This deprived the Company

from reaping the benefits of competitive prices


-----

particularly when the vendor base of the

Company was thin.

***** **Non-monitoring of price trend**

The company and its units were not monitoring
the price trends of material and components
despite specific provision in its Purchase
Procedure.

***** **Delays in placement of purchase orders**
**and inspection of material**

In 38 percent of cases examined, the units of
the Company failed to adhere to the specified
time limit for placement of purchase orders.
Moreover, in 66 percent of the cases where
purchase orders had been finalized, there were
delays in dispatching the Purchase orders to
the vendors. The Company had not fixed any
time lines for various stages of procurement
process, i.e. tender evaluation and placement
of purchase orders after its finalization.



***** **Under utilization of overseas offices**

The Company could not leverage its overseas
offices to reap savings in the import of
material.

***** **Cost reduction measures**

Indigenization, which was supposed to be one
of the major drivers of cost reduction, was not
very successful as is evident from the fact that
the value of purchase orders placed on foreign
vendors increased from 48 percent in 2007-08

to 68 percent in 2009-10.

***** **Unrealistic budgeting**

Company failed to exercise a realistic
assessment of its requirement of its expenditure
on procurement as in all the three years, the
actual expenditure of procurement deviated
by more than 20 percent from the planned
expenditure.
