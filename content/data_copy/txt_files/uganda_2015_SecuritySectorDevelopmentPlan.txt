# FOREWORD

###### The Security Sector Development Plan for the period 2015/16-2020/21 outlines broad strategic goals of the sector as well as the specifc, outputs and outcomes to be achieved during the period including their associated costs. This Plan is the frst since the establish- ment of the security sector in late 1990s. It comes in the wake of successful conclusion of Uganda’s frst National Development Plan (NDP I) and the onset of the 5th National Resist- ance Movement (NRM) election Manifesto 2016-2021.

 In the past the individual sub-sectors (MoDVA, ISO & ESO) have been developing their separate strategic plans.Lessons and experiences emanating from the development and implementation of the previous plans have provided important inputs in the formulation of this plan. It is aligned to the global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), Uganda vision 2040, the second National Development Plan (NDP II) and the NRM Manifesto com- mitments 2016-2021.

 The broad outline of this strategic plan encompasses sector objectives and priority pro- jects to be implemented by end of FY 2020/21. These centre on the consolidation and generation of security sector capability, strengthening internal and external security, enhancement of defence and security infrastructure, enhanced Research and Develop- ment, engagement in productive activities for Wealth creation and establishment of National Service. 

 Efective implementation of this plan will sustain the peaceful and stable environment that will enable the country enjoy faster and robust socio-economic development. The Security sector therefore is committed to the implementation of this strategic plan.

 I am grateful to the technical security Sector Working Group (SWG) and the various com- mittees within the sub-sectors for synthesizing the strategic guidance given to them by the leadership at sector and national levels. I also appreciate and applaud the good work and support from National Planning Authority (NPA) which strengthened the process of developing this plan.

 For God and my Country

 Hon. Adolf Mwesige Minister of Defence and Veteran Afairs

# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Security forces play a critical role in ensuring that there is an enabling environment for other sectors to
fourish and Uganda requires a signifcant amount of resources to build and maintain professional and
capable security forces to address a full range of national and regional security challenges.
This Security Sector Development Plan (SSDP) outlines the ongoing achievements and eforts in modernizing and professionalizing the security forces including planned interventions for further improvements. It frst defnes and reviews the country’s strategic environment and the security threats therein.
Guided by the Vision 2040, the Second National Development Plan (NDP II) and the 2016 National
Resistance Movement election manifesto, it further highlights the sector objectives and their corresponding interventions.
The plan then describes the diferent projects and programs the sector will undertake in the 5 year
planning period. It also provides the institutional arrangements available for efcient implementation
and Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) arrangements of the plan to ensure achievement of envisaged
objectives.
Finally, it highlights the fnancial resources required to undertake the planned activities.

### Strategic Environment

National interests and associated threats make up Uganda’s strategic environment.
Uganda’s national interests may be defned by the need for:

a) A stable, strong, economically prosperous and a united state that will facilitate and guarantee
the freedom, safety, and wellbeing of the individual Ugandan.
b) The need to guarantee Uganda’s territorial integrity and sovereignty.
c) Regional and international peace, security and stability.

Uganda Strategic Security Environment is marked by several factors which vary over time as circumstances change. These inculde;
a) Geostrategic Context - Uganda is situated in the “Heart of Africa,” and lacks direct access to the
sea and in a conflct infested Great Lakes region thus may have to contend with spill-over efects from
time to time amidst her limited defensive options.
b) Shallow Strategic Depth - Uganda’s shallow strategic depth ratio of 93km² of territory to every
Kilometre of border means that space cannot be traded for time. It also reduces her defensive options.
c) Shared Natural Resources - s some natural resources with her neighbours, increasing her
potential for confict in the region.
d) Climate security - Climate change is afecting the border lines especially those set by water
bodies thus it is a threat multiplier and a risk driver of today and in the future.
e) Porous Borders - Absence of natural barriers to defne some of Uganda’s borders makes it easier
for potentially disruptive groups to cross into the country; and makes it harder to police and defend
these borders.
f) Membership in Regional and International Organizations - This membership opens
opportunities to beneft from the collective security environment and facilitates the projection of infuence necessary to protect and safeguard Uganda’s interests. It also creates obligations which may
impact on the national security imperatives.
g) Size and Nature of the Economy - Uganda has a small and developing economy, which is largely
subsistence. This impacts on the development of military capability in terms of equipment, manpower
and training, and calls for frugal and efcient use of the country’s resources.

infrastructure, has created vulnerabilities and opportunities to be exploited by unscrupulous actors.
i) Energy security - Closely linked to climate change, energy supply is becoming a cause of great
concern for the security of Ugandans. The fundamental problem is that the majority population is
relying on traditional low-cost energy (wood fuel) a source which is fast dwindling.
j) Social Cohesion - Social cohesion can be compromised by a high degree of ethnic and religious
diversity; the increasing gap between the rich and the poor; the rural-urban divide; and gender
imbalances.
k) Disease threats - Health risks such as pandemics pose another growing challenge to National
security. Addressing these problems demands a sophisticated and coordinated response from national
and international health bodies acting in a coordinated manner.
l) Globalization - Globalization has presented challenging dynamics in the security environment.
The complexity introduced by the diversity, volatility and uncertainty within the threat of environment
limits and challenges the strategic and operational options.

### Approach

Uganda’s security threats are diverse and do not respect any artifcial boundaries between sectors, nor
do they distinguish ordinary citizens from government or business entity. To efectively and efciently
deal with the threats, a Comprehensive Security Approach (CSA) was designed against the threats and is
elaborated in the Security Policy Framework.

This whole-of-government framework includes a wide range of government players in understanding
the threats, planning responses and implementation to achieve National Security (NS). The
collaboration is both at national and Local Government (LG) levels with administrative structures to
bring parties together and exchange information and to establish leaders in the distributed responses
to security threats.

Security threats also do respect the colonial borders and thus Uganda’s approach involves enhancing
collaboration and making alliances at continental and regional levels, as provided for under the African
Peace and Security Architecture (APSA).
The Security sector therefore works closely with other actors at global, continental, regional, national
and Local Government levels to ensure that Uganda’s interests including aspirations to become a high
income country are defended and protected.
### Strategic Direction of the Sector

Over, the entire period of the SSDP, the security sector will focus on maintaining a stable and peaceful
Uganda; defend and protect the people and their property; Sovereignty and territorial integrity as well
as the Constitution.

The security sector objectivies for the second national development plan period include the following;
a) Improvement in the capability of defense and security forces
b) Strengthening internal and external security
c) Enhancing defence and security infrastructure
d) Enhancing research and development (R&D)
e) Enhancing production for wealth creation and self-sustenance
f) Establishment of a national service
g) Improvement of administration, policy and planning.

e) Strengthened and Institutionalized sector Research and development eforts nationally,
regionally and globally.
These will be achieved through: Enhancement of Capability; Strengthening Security; Developing
Defence and Security Infrastructure; Establishment of National Service; Strengthening Administration,
Policy and Planning; Enhancing Research and Development (R&D); and Enhancing Production for
wealth creation and self-sustainability.

These key projects which will be undertaken include: the Defence Capacity Building Project; construction of the Military Referral Hospital (MRH); Establishment of a National Service; Barracks Construction;
Revitalization of the Food and Beverages Production Projects, Luwero Industries, Magamaga Armoured
Vehicle Engineering, and the Defence Research, Science and Technology Centre (DRSTC)-Lugazi; as well
as Development of UPDAF Physical Infrastructure.

### SECTION ONE: BACKGROUND

 1.1 Introduction

Uganda Vision 2040 envisages transformation of Uganda’s society from a peasant to a modern and prosperous one in 30 years. The strategic goal therefore is to modernize and cause the metamorphosis of the
Ugandan society into a middle income, skilled working class and ultimately into a knowledge-based
society. The Vision is all inclusive and recognizes Defence and Security as one of the fundamentals that
must be enhanced to enable the transformation of Uganda.
Currently, Uganda is implementing her second National Development Plan (NDP II). Specifcally, the plan
provides an overview, objectives and interventions which if undertaken the sectors should enable the
country have faster rate of growth and development. Sectors are required to develop plans to reveal the
path they will undertake to implement the provisions of the NDP II.
National Security requires that the Government should protect the State and its citizens against all kinds
of threats through strengthening of its security sector capabilities, diplomacy and regional cooperation,
economic power, information, and any other measures that government may deem appropriate.

Uganda’s strategic security environment is characterized by, her geographical location including lack of
direct access to the sea coast, the shallow strategic depth, shared natural resources, as well as regional
and international obligations. Overtime, Uganda’s security threats have diversifed to include non-military ones for instance environmental degradation, epidemics, natural disasters (foods, earthquakes),
landslides and terrorism.

Uganda’s security actors therefore, operate in conditions that are sometimes characterized by instability
and social upheaval. Consequently, they should have the capacity to conduct operations on multiple
fronts in defence of national interests and borders; and to respond to spillover efects of instability in the
neighbouring countries. Specifcally, the defence force should be able to support and maintain peace
beyond its borders in fulfllment of regional and international obligations.

This background calls for a fexible and multifaceted approach to planning and implementation of the
identifed interventions and projects focusing on the long-term gains as opposed to the short-term. It
also requires a time-tested doctrine and robust systems for equipment acquisition, capacity building
and improved welfare for human resources.

The Security Sector Development Plan (SSDP) is therefore designed to achieve the strategic direction for
the sector as described in the second National Development Plan (NDP II). It states the outputs and indicates estimated costs (with MTEF) necessary to achieve these policy objectives. In essence, the SSDP
serves as a bridge between where the sector is today and where it wants to be fve years ahead in a practical manner.

### 1.2 Purpose

The purpose of this Security Sector Development Plan (SSDP) is to highlight planned key interventions
and projects of the Security sector for the next fve years in support of the realisation of Vision 2040, NDP
II and implementation of the 2016 NRM Manifesto. The SSDP seeks to achieve the goals set by these
overarching policy instruments.
The plan will be used to guide the development of individual MDA specifc strategic and annual work
plans. It will further be used as a benchmark for performance assessment.

### 1.3 Defnition of Security

Security in the widest context is not straightforward, at least conceptually. It means freedom to live, act
and make choices. Security encompasses freedom from threats, intimidation and other pressures, from
whatever source, that might undermine the basic rights, welfare and property of Ugandans and the
proper functioning of the systems of governance. Economic prosperity rests on security, including the
protection of trade routes, construction of infrastructure and, ultimately, the defence of the territorial
integrity and national sovereignty.
Security is therefore multi-dimensional in response towards protecting National Interests against
threats, both internal and external. Provision of security underpins and guarantees the pursuit of
National Objectives as enshrined in the Constitution of Uganda.

### 1.4 National Objectives, Interests and Values

National Objectives and Directive Principles of State Policy guide policy decisions by state organs, individuals and/or other bodies. They include democratic principles; promotion of national unity and stability; protection of national sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity; protection of fundamental human rights and freedoms; protection of Uganda’s natural resources; mitigation of natural disasters; sustainable management of the environment; and promotion of the foreign policy objectives of
Uganda.

###### 1.4.1 National Interests
Article 8A (1) of the Constitution states that Uganda shall be governed on principles of national interest
and common good enshrined in the national objectives and directive principles of state policy. Uganda’s national interests may be defned by the need for:
a) A stable, strong, economically prosperous and a united state that will facilitate and guarantee
the freedom, safety, and wellbeing of the individual Ugandan.
b) The need to guarantee Uganda’s territorial integrity and sovereignty.
c) Regional and international peace, security and stability.

###### 1.4.2 National Values
These are the guiding principles, or standards of behaviour that are considered as desirable, important,
and held in high esteem. They instill a sense of national good and defne the character of the Ugandan
State. Uganda’s core values include:
a) Patriotism: Based on the love for self, family, culture, and Uganda. It denotes a love for the country to the extent that one is willing to sacrifce and if necessary die for.
b) National Unity: Promotion and consolidation of national unity through the promotion of a
common language (Swahili) within the army and in the country.
c) Regional Integration and Pan-Africanism: The recognition that Africans share a common destiny
predicated upon freedom and socio-economic transformation.
d) Freedom: From exploitation and oppression. This means the liberty of citizens to make their own
choices; the ability to carry out lawful endeavours of their choice without hindrance, to associate without interference, and to believe without undue infuence.
e) Democracy: This means a government of the people, by the people and for the people that must
be transparent and accountable.
f) Private Enterprise: The belief that the primary drivers of economic prosperity are private entrepreneurs and the role of the state is to facilitate them in their legal endeavours.
g) Zero tolerance of sectarianism and group chauvinism. Legitimate group aims such as language
and religion are welcome only for positive purposes; but must not include sectarianism or chauvinism.

###### SECURITY SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PLAN 2015/16 2019/20 12

### 1.5 Security Sector Composition and mandates

The security sector which is chaired by the Ministry of Defence and Veteran Afairs is composed of the
following MDAs:
a) Ministry of Defence and Veteran Afairs (MoDVA)
b) Internal Security Organisation (ISO)
c) External Security Organisation (ESO).
The MoDVA provides strategic leadership to the Uganda Peoples Defence Forces (UPDF). The UPDF was
established under article 208 of the 1995 Constitution of the Republic of Uganda; and mandated under
article 209 to:
a) Preserve and defend the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Uganda
b) Cooperate with the civilian authority in emergency situations and in cases of natural disasters
c) Foster harmony and understanding between the defence forces and civilians; and
d) Engage in productive activities for the development of Uganda.

Internal Security Organisation (ISO) and External Security Organisation (ESO) respectively provide internal and external intelligence on matters having security implications to the country as provided for by
article 218 of the Constitution of Uganda.
Furthermore, it is a Constitutional requirement under article 221, that all security actors must observe
and respect human rights and freedoms in the performance of their functions and duties. The sector will
also continue to perform its duties in line with requirements of International Human Rights instruments,
specifcally Article 22 (2) of UN covenant on civil and political rights.

### 1.6 Defence and Security Sector Objectives under NDP II

The following objectives are envisaged to be achieved by the sector in the course of the fve-year
period:
a) Improvement in the capability of defense and security forces
b) Strengthening internal and external security
c) Enhancing defence and security infrastructure
d) Enhancing research and development (R&D)
e) Enhancing production for wealth creation and self-sustenance
f) Establishment of a national service
g) Improvement of administration, policy and planning.

### 1. 7 Guiding Principles

The development of this sector plan has been guided by some key concepts to make it understandable,
relevant and implementable. These include holistic, politically acceptable, feasibility, suitable to the
circumstances; and sustainability.

###### Holistic - The SSDP fully takes into account the range of security threats and organizational structures
that shape the range of possible outputs to ensure National security. The SSDP fulflls the diverse interests of Uganda including peace, stability and economic prosperity.

###### Acceptability - As a plan, SSDP must be politically acceptable. In developing this plan a clear understanding of stakeholder interests, and their relative importance was considered. To increase its acceptability, the plan was tested against its legality in terms of the existing laws of Uganda and International
obligations; and whether it is achievable within the limits of risks that may be determined by time and
funding.

###### Feasibility - All plans must be realistic in order to be achieved. In developing this plan, wishful thinking was avoided. To fully realise the feasibility principle, the plan is guided by the minimum, not the maximum, commitment of resources. Therefore, this plan is anchored on the Medium Term Expenditure
Framework (MTEF) projections. The question of these MTEF resources being sufcient or not is outside
the scope of this plan.

###### Sustainability - Sustainability is a broad concept and not restricted to material sustainability. The
SSDP enjoys both the physical and moral commitment that will see it implemented.

### 1.8 Structure of the Sector Plan

The plan is organized into six (6) sections:
a) Section one gives the background and introduces the Defence and Security sector, and the
manner in which the sector coordinates the management of security threats in Uganda.
b) Section two presents the situation analysis of Uganda’s security both from internal and external
perspectives, including the achievements and challenges experienced in the past 10 year period.
c) Section three outlines the strategic direction for the sector that includes priority interventions
and projects that will drive the process towards achieving the sector’s broad objectives in the next fve
years.
d) Section four explains the institutional arrangement within the sector that enhance efciency and
efectiveness in provision of national security.
e) Section fve highlights the fnancing strategy to be employed to ensure efective implementation
of the plan.
f) Lastly, section six defnes the framework for monitoring and evaluation including building a case
for the proposed structures in future.

### SECTION TWO: SITUATION ANALYSIS

 2.0 Introduction

In the past fve years, Uganda’s security situation has remained generally calm and peaceful. The core
state security actors continued to collaborate with the Wananchi to ensure peace and stability within
Uganda and the region. The same is projected to continue in the Second National Development Plan
(NDP II) planning period. Whereas it is not possible to fully predict with certainty the future security
situation, study and analysis have been undertaken to understand the strategic security environment as
much as possible and accordingly develop the requisite capacity and capabilities todeal with the
threats.

### 2.1 Strategic Security Environment

The factors that mark Uganda’s strategic environment include the following, which vary over time as
circumstances change:

###### a) Geostrategic Context - Uganda is situated in the “Heart of Africa,” and lacks direct access
to the sea. This increases her vulnerability because it limits her communication and increases the costs
of external trade. Because of its central geographical location in a region that is prone to conficts, the
country may have to contend with spillover efects from time to time. Finally, because Uganda is a small
country in comparison with most of her neighbours, her defensive options are limited.

###### b) Shallow Strategic Depth - Uganda’s shallow strategic depth ratio of 93km² of territory to
every Kilometer of border means that space cannot be traded for time. It also reduces her defensive
options in the event of an external attack. This means that the country must develop the necessary
pro-active strategies to promote regional cohesion, manage the borders better, and develop the ability
to deter potential adversaries from afar.

###### c) Shared Natural Resources - Uganda shares some natural resources with her neighbours,
including the Nile River; Lakes Victoria, Albert and Edward; the Rwenzori, Elgon and Muhabura Mountains as well as oil deposits on the western border. These shared natural resources increase the potential
for confict in the region, while on the other hand they may tempt foreign powers into undermining
Uganda’s development.

###### d) Climate security - Climate change is bringing new and hard-to-manage instabilities to
Uganda’s peace and stability. Climate risks such as such as extreme water shortages, water contamination, landslides, droughts and foods pose serious threats to lives of the people and infrastructure.
Further, climate change is afecting the border lines especially those set by water bodies. Therefore,
climate change is a threat multiplier and a risk driver of today and in the future.

###### e) Porous Borders - Absence of natural barriers like mountains, lakes, rivers, etc. to defne some
of Uganda’s borders makes it easier for potentially disruptive groups to cross into the country; and
makes it harder to police and defend these borders.

###### SECURITY SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PLAN 2015/16 2019/20 15


-----

###### f) Membership in Regional and International Organizations Ugandas mem
bership in regional organizations like the East African Community (EAC), Inter-Governmental Authority
on Development (IGAD) and International Conference on the Great Lakes Region (ICGLR), and international organizations like the United Nations (UN), and the African Union (AU) is an essential part of its
strategic environment. This membership opens opportunities to beneft from the collective security
environment and facilitates the projection of infuence necessary to protect and safeguard Uganda’s
interests. It also creates obligations which may impact on the national security imperatives.

###### g) Size and Nature of the Economy - Uganda has a small and developing economy, which
is largely subsistence. This impacts on the development of military capability in terms of equipment,
manpower and training, and calls for frugal and efcient use of the country’s resources.

###### h) Cyber security – Society’s increasing dependence on global information and communications infrastructure, has created vulnerabilities and opportunities to be exploited by unscrupulous
actors. Whether through malicious hacking, fnancial fraud, espionage or cyber warfare, the dangers
posed by cyber-attacks are increasing the risks to national security. Such unauthorized access to electronic information systems vital for maintaining national security of Uganda or the critical governmental
infrastructure can create a serious threat and have a negative impact on her security.

###### i) Energy security - Closely linked to climate change, energy supply is becoming a cause of
great concern for the security of Ugandans. The fundamental problem is that the majority population is
relying on traditional low-cost energy (wood fuel) a source which is fast dwindling.

###### j) Social Cohesion - Social cohesion can be compromised by a high degree of ethnic and
religious diversity; the increasing gap between the rich and the poor; the rural-urban divide; and gender
imbalances.

###### k) Disease threats - Health risks such as pandemics pose another growing challenge to National security. Addressing these problems demands a sophisticated and coordinated response from national and international health bodies acting in a coordinated manner. For instance, pathogenic microbes
are dangerous to global health whether they appear as naturally occurring diseases, as organisms resistant to antimicrobial drugs or in acts of biological terrorism.

###### l) Globalization - Globalization has presented challenging dynamics in the security environment. The complexity introduced by the diversity, volatility and uncertainty within the threat of environment limits and challenges the strategic and operational options.
Uganda’s Strategic Environment, therefore brings about several security threats which the sector has to
cope with as it fulflls its mandate. The security sector is undertaking a range of tasks which seeks to
analyse key challenges, identify policy responses and establish a knowledge base for the Government
and wider society.

### [2.2 Ugandas Approach to Security management ]

Uganda’s general broad defnition of security acknowledges security as an essential condition for development. Security is viewed in a wider sense and departs from the traditional focus on military. Uganda’s
approach to security management in pursuit of protecting national interests is holistic and comprehensive in nature, involving use of elements of national power available to the Government. This includes
diplomatic machinery, economic, population, information and the military power. The approach seeks
to combine responses to resolve immediate threats yet with longer-term goals to either deter or prevent
potential security problems from coming to reality. The actions are based on the assessment of the
factors that threaten national interests and how they can best be addressed in the most appropriate
manner.
Therefore, in keeping with the multi-dimensional notion of security that the Government of Uganda
subscribes to, the Security Policy Framework Paper (SPF) was developed to guide greater understanding
her security needs and how threats can be resolved. The SPF is a cross-Governmental initiative that
makes relevant security actors develop a common appreciation of the nature of Uganda’s security problems, who has responsibility for addressing what threat, and how the responses of the actors can be
coordinated most efectively. It further explains how the National security question fts into regional and
international security requirements as well as Uganda’s broader development agenda

###### 2.2.1 General Security Situation
Today, the whole country is peaceful, with the districts of Northern and Eastern joining the rest of the
country in enjoying the peace and stability;

people of Northern Uganda the much needed peace required for economic development. The security
forces decisively defated the LRA insurgency forcing them to run into hiding in Garamba National Park
in DR Congo and later CAR where they continue committing atrocities against humanity.

b) The lawlessness created by the Karimojong warriors and their karachunas had made Karamoja
region and its neighbouring districts insecure. The successful disarmament exercise in Karamoja resulted in normalcy and economic recovery in the region. Through the use of both Voluntary and Forceful
disarmament the illegal guns are almost eliminated in Karamoja allowing the rule of law to be restored.

-c) The urban terrorism which included ADF bomb throwers in Kampala are now history and a
specialized task force is in place to counter any type of terrorist threat that may emerge. Operations
against ADF in western Uganda resulted ADF rebels killed, arms and ammunitions recovered, rebels
captured and children rescued handed over their families. However, remnants of ADF operating inside
DR Congo remain posing a security threat to Uganda.

d) Military Operations Other Than War (MOOTW) were undertaken aimed at deterring war, resolving confict, promoting peace and supporting civil authorities in response to crises. The UPDF has developed adequate capacity to undertake MOOTW in support of national, regional and international eforts
in peace support operations and disaster management. Over the years, UPDF has successfully given
support to areas afected by the epidemics like Ebola, emergency evacuations and foods like in Northern and Eastern Uganda.

e) In terms of regional peace efort, Uganda’s approach to National security issues considers the
aggregate advantages that a rise from regional alliances and cooperation in defence to enhance Regional Peace and Security. To this end, the UPDF and ESO have developed capacity to support Regional and
Continental Security needs through the East African Community (EAC), International Conference on
Great Lakes Region (ICGLR), Inter-Governmental Authority on Development (IGAD) and the African
Union (AU).

f) The UPDF and ESO have played a signifcant role in the area of Peace Support Operations, especially in Liberia, Darfur, and Somalia. When Uganda went to Somalia in March 2007, comments from all
and sundry were that Uganda was on an impossible mission. Nine years down the road, Uganda’s
achievements in Somalia are highly applauded regionally and internationally. It has slowly managed to
strengthen the fragile security sector in Somalia, and provided a fairly secure environment that is
enabling state rebuilding. The recovery of more areas from Al shabaab terrorists by AMISOM and Somali
National Army (SNA) has created more space for state formation, economic development as well as
promotion and protection of Human Rights and provision of humanitarian access. This is clear evidence
of Uganda’s commitment to a stable and peaceful Africa.

There is overwhelming evidence that the prevailing peace and stability in Uganda will lead to economic
prosperity. For instance the defeat of Kony’s LRA and the ADF terrorists that used to cause a lot of insecurity by killing and kidnapping Wananchi has resulted into improved tourist arrivals. Growth in tourism
sector is a good indicator for security, since tourists will always keep away from real or potential danger.
The table below illustrates this:

# 2.3 Transformation of Security Forces
The security situation amidst the above-mentioned threats has been possible due to deliberate and
sustained eforts to modernise and professionalise the security sector. The vision of transforming Uganda’s security forces is to have a professional staf that are well trained, well equipped and an excellent
relationship with the people in order to sustain conditions in the country which will enable economic
growth, stability, democracy and national unity.
The UPDF transformation programme from a guerrilla army to a modern defence force serving a democracy is very much on course especially in the Equipment, personnel and training as well as support structures.

###### 2.3.1 Equipment - Enhancements in military capability resulting into better fre power delivery, troop
protection, mobility, command, control and Communication, intelligence and higher morale have been
the focus. The sector has continued to build its capability commensurate with the threats and technological development as well as the resources with a strategy of focusing on being on top of the situation.

###### 2.3.2 Training - The training strategy has always been aimed at equipping the soldiers and other staf
with attitudes, skills and knowledge that make them ferocious and highly adaptable to the changing
strategic environment. Training has been undertaken for command and staf both within Uganda and
outside. To ensure that the security forces understand the strategic context of their operational environment including their own role in socio-economic development of the country, training has been inclusive
of the following courses:

###### 2.3.3 Political Education “Siasa” - Siasa a Swahili word that refers to politics: In the context of
Uganda, it refers to the elements that shape the ideological foundation of the UPDF and other security
actors. Political education helps to cement the strategic partnership with the people of Uganda in its
struggle to provide environment for socio-economic transformation. The security forces will continue to
be educated on their core role of protecting the people of Uganda, and counting upon them as their
strategic allies in national Defence and sovereignty of Uganda. Siasa has remained the benchmark in the
success and the shaping of the nature and character of the UPDF.

rity actors today require a class of ofcers, who can think through issues that infuence and afect national policy and being able to position their role in broad strategic context. The Senior Command and Staf
College (SCSC) Kimaka and Institute of Strategic Studies (ISS) have helped to clear the training backlog
for senior ofcers created by relying on foreign countries to train the senior ofcers. Established in 2005,
SCSC –Kimaka now has become a regional centre of excellence drawing participants from sister Africa
region countries.

###### 2.3.5 Junior Ofcers Course - The UPDF is equally aware that good commanders are not made
at senior level but rather at junior level. Consequently the sector leadership has built and refurbished a
Junior Command and Staf College at Jinja to equip junior ofcers with leadership and command skills.
The college has also been made available to the sister countries in the East African Community states in
accordance with the protocol on Cooperation in Defence and security.

###### 2.3.6 Cadet Training - The Uganda Military Academy for Cadet Training initially in Jinja has now
been homed in Kabamba. Through this training, civilians who join the Armed Forces and the young,
qualifying serving militants are transformed into army ofcers with adequate leadership skills to enable
them execute command and leadership responsibilities.

###### 2.3.7 Specialized Training - A soldier/ofcer through his/her career lineTraining is required to
acquire knowledge or skills that will enhance knowledge of his profession. Civilians and military ofcers
require training in various arms and services, like in intelligence collection and analysis, armoured
warfare, air defence, artillery, signal and communication.
The Uganda People’s Defence Air Force (UPDAF) has constructed its Aviation Training Academy at Nakasongola. More renovation of the old structures and runways is going on. Once this infrastructure is complete, the Air Force Headquarters will be shifted from Entebbe to Nakasongola.

###### 2.3.8 Other skills -The staf are also be required to train in other non-professional areas required to
enhance professionalism in a wide operational context. Such training may be required in the area of
Diplomacy, International Humanitarian Law, Peace Support Operations, Human Rights and foreign
languages.

# 2.4 Defence Management Systems and Processes

###### 2.4.1 Organization/ Command and Control - UPDF is now a bi-service force on track to
becoming a multi-service one with streamlined command and control structures for land, Air and the
Special Forces. The Ministry of Defence and UPDF General Headquarters are physically and structurally
detached from the service Headquarters and provides strategic policy and political guidance to the
services for difusion and implementation.

###### 2.4.2 Policy and Planning - The Policy and Planning processes as well as structures have been
established and formalized. There is participation by lower level units and formation commanders in
planning and budgeting. In conjunctions with the Ministry of Public Service, the Management and
departmental structures are being restructured and improved to bring them in sync with the wider
public service and be able to efectively support the defence forces.

###### SECURITY SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PLAN 2015/16 2019/20 20


-----

###### 2.4.3 Information Communication Technologies The computerization programme
through the Integrated Resource Management Information System (IRMIS), has computerized personnel database and made acquiring, storing, analyzing as well as controlling information fow easy, reliable
and timely to decision makers. IRMIS has sent the phenomenon of ghost soldiers in the books of UPDF
history. The wider-government Integrated Financial Management System (IFMS) and the Integrated
Personnel and Payroll System (IPPS) are operational in the ministry and have eased the processing of
payments.

###### 2.4.4 Research and Development (R&D) - The Technical Information and Services Unit
(TISU) was established to research and keep UPDF ahead of Scientifc, Technological and other changes
needed for successful military operations. Targeted recruitment and training of professionals was undertaken, subsequently interventions to fully utilise the recruited personnel are ongoing. The ministry
acquired former Lugazi University with an aim to turn it into a centre of excellence for R&D. This is still
underway, consequently, the anticipated technology transfer together with procurement of the requisite raw materials and equipment is planned in the near future.

###### 2.4.5 Physical Infrastructure Development - The Ministry of Defence and UPDF achieved
signifcantly in terms of infrastructure development. A number of health and sanitation facilities have
been constructed and/or rehabilitated across several barracks; several ofces at the MoDVA strategic
Headquarters and UPDF divisions and brigades have been renovated and upgraded. Military training
college infrastructure in terms of facilities, like schools and academies, shooting grounds have been
constructed. Priority has also been given to administration blocks, armouries and gun sheds in permanent barracks. Special Forces Command and Marines have had improved operational infrastructure. For
the Military Referral Hospital, the process is underway.

###### 2.4.6 Building capacity of Engineers Brigade - The Engineer’s Brigade has also increased
its capacity in terms of personnel recruitment, training and equipment. Currently capacity is being created to enable UPDF comfortably participate in big projects like Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) construction. The Engineer’s Brigade is being restructured to be able to undertake roles commensurate to the
Defence missions and national infrastructure development requirements.

###### 2.4.7 Uganda Defence Doctrine (UDD); which addresses the UPDF’s approach to military
operations by providing the link between the national strategic environment, the operational level of
war, and the tactical actions of the various feld commanders has been documented. UDD not only
enhances professionalism but also refnes UPDF’s operational leverage in Joint, Combined or Multi-Agency environments. UDD further equips the commanders and staf with the perspectives necessary
to apply operational art to achieve victory across the whole Spectrum of Confict.

###### 2.4.8 Procurement and Logistics - Today, all Defence Procurements are in conformity with the
Public Procurement & Disposal of Public Assets Act 2003 as amended. In order to further increase
efciencies, a decision to have procurement of selected items decentralized to Division levels was taken
and it is being implemented with good results.

###### 2.4.9 Force Welfare - Right from the days of armed struggle in Luwero bushes, UPDF recognizes
that the personnel are the single most important resource, for without which the equipment become
meaningless. Staf welfare and that of their families are taken as high priority. The sector has a clear
welfare policy dealing with issues of pay, clothing, support, medical-care, education and leave.

###### SECURITY SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PLAN 2015/16 2019/20 21

g p g y
The timely payment of salaries and emoluments has been a source of motivation. However, for ISO and
ESO, there is a concern that salaries have stagnated for close to a decade without signifcant increase.
MoDVA has not implemented a single spine salary structure for soldiers due to budgetary constraints.
The sector will lobby that starting in FY 2017/18, soldiers’ salaries to be increased to the level commensurate with their equivalents in health and Education sectors.

###### 2.4.11 HIV/AIDS treatment and awareness - The sector recognizes the Government efort
in curbing the HIV/AIDS pandemic. HIV/AIDS mainly afect the most productive demographic section in
the country. In this case, the security sector but more especially UPDF as an institution has been a victim
and is categorized among the Most At-Risk Populations segments (MARPs). The sector strategy has been
to sensitise the staf about the dangers of HIV/AIDS including the need to live responsibly, treat, manage
and provide free ARVs to all. Medicare schemes in collaboration with Ministry of Health, National Medical Stores (NMS), Joint Clinical Research Centre (JCRC) and development partners were established in
the sector. Several Health Care Units, ranging from Medical Regimental Services (MRS), Field Hospitals to
Referral Hospitals have been put in place. The sensitization campaigns including ensuring that troops
live responsibly is a command function within UPDF.

###### 2.4.12 Clothing/ Soldiers Uniforms - The issue of clothing in the UPDF is being addressed,
although the challenge of underfunding has been perennially faced. Every ofcer and militant is entitled to two pairs of quality uniform per year.

###### 2.4.13 Savings and Credit Cooperative Organisations (SACCOs) - To further improve
the welfare of the sector members and that of their families, the savings and credit schemes in forms of
Savings and Credit Cooperative was introduced and members encouraged saving and taking loans. To
date the UPDF’ Wazalendo SACCO (WSSACO) has a total of over 60,000 members and capital base of UG
Shs. 75 billion. More than 10000 members have already been given loans.

###### 2.4.14Annual Leave - Every ofcer and militant of the UPDF is now entitled to annual leave. 
Before UPDF, other sub-sector staf were already enjoying this entitlement. Regular and predictable
annual leave gives staf an opportunity to do something for themselves at home and also be able to
interact with their family members and relatives as well as preparing for life after service.
# 2.5 Engagement in Production

The UPDF continued to fulfll its constitutional mandate of engaging in productive activities for national
development. Specifcally:

###### 2.5.1 Operation Wealth Creation (OWC) - Building on the success of the pilot scheme that
posted impressive results in just two years, OWC was rolled out to cover the whole country. Consequently, OWC utilized the unique skills of UPDF who were originally working with NAADs players to implement a new model designed with assistance of Makerere University College of Agricultural Environmental Sciences (CAES). Since the involvement of UPDF, the following planting inputs have been distributed
to Ugandan farmers: 870 tons of beans; 2,064 tons of maize; 27.3 million cofee seedlings; and 4,199,355
tea seedlings. Others included 412 mango seedlings, 846,756 orange seedlings, 48,243 bags of cassava
cuttings, 10,000 banana suckers and 438,000 tree seedlings.

###### SECURITY SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PLAN 2015/16 2019/20 22

###### g y ( ) p g g g
implementation of SGR under Northern Corridor Infrastructure Projects (NCIP), the Ministry of Defence
in partnership with CHEC (China Harbour Engineering Company) plans to rehabilitate, remodel and
upgrade Tororo Barracks into a regional Roads and Railway Polytechnic to train Artisans and Technicians.
In addition, the Roads and Railway engineers’ regiment has been established and over 15 UPDF engineers and technicians were trained abroad and approximately 250 soldiers and civilians have been
trained.

###### 2.5.3 National Enterprises Corporation (NEC) limited. National Enterprises Corporation
(NEC) limited was established by Parliament as a commercial wing of NRA/UPDF to deliver quality products and services to government departments and the general public by undertaking a wide range of
economic activities in a sustainable manner. However, starting in late 1990s till three years ago, NEC’s
performance had not been to the desired expectations. Consequently, the Minister of Defence
embarked on a restructuring programme to refocus and make NEC more efcient and efective. In 2014,
a new corporation board was appointed by the Minister to fast-track performance improvement. The
subsidiaries under NEC including Luwero Industries Limited (LIL), NEC Tractors Ltd and NEC Works Ltd
are being revamped. Another company under NEC is Uzima Mineral water Ltd. Uzima water Ltd established a natural mineral water plant at Kakiri barracks and was ofcially launched by H.E. the president
on 6th February 2016 as part of the ceremonies marking 35 years since founding the NRA/UPDF.

###### 2.5.4Uganda Air Cargo Corporation (UACC). The Uganda Air Cargo Corporation (UACC) is
another commercial body under the Ministry of Defence. UACC mainly ofers cargo services to the security sector, private sector, public sector as well as international agencies like the UN and WFP. Since 2012,
UACC has also been ofering passenger charter services after the acquisition of passenger aircrafts.
UACC continues to support the AMISOM in particular airlifting both UPDF and Burundi troops as well as
logistics to the operation theatre (Somalia). Other services include Medical evacuations, VIP charters,
Fun fights, Aerial surveys, and Humanitarian /Relief fights.

# 2.6 Major challenges to Security Sector

a) The major challenge to the performance of the defence and security sector is inadequate funding to enhance capability to the requisite levels. Whereas amount of resources a country spends on her
defence and security depends on the assessment of the security threats, for Uganda this seems not to be
the case. During the 2002-04 Uganda Defence Review exercise it was assessed that an estimated 5.4
trillion Uganda shillings was required to transform the UPDF to the desired capability and supporting
structures for efective defence of Uganda’s interests and national values. However, given Uganda’s
economic capacity, the level of funding necessary to achieve this vision force was only possible in the
long term. Consequently the sector has had to grapple with the challenge of fnding the right balance
between developing a level of UPDF capability that can adequately deal with threats at an acceptable
level of risk and an afordable cost.
As illustrated in the table below, Uganda spends less on defence as a percentage of GDP per capita in the
region. The defence expenditure is below most of Eastern Africa countries as a percentage of GDP:

The other challenges include:
b) Inadequate infrastructure in the sector constraining welfare, administration and provision of
security.
c) Low levels of Innovation, Research and Development (R&D).
d) Insufcient facilities for security sector production enterprises constraining the sectors’ ability to
contribute towards economic development.
e) Ideological including; lack of Patriotism, negative attitudes & mind-sets, and sectarianism leading
to insecurity.
f) Inadequate administration, policy and planning systems.
g) Dynamic and ever evolving threats to National Security.
h) Poor Terms and Conditions of Service which have caused high attrition rates. This has hindered
the sector’s ability to attract and retain personnel to the required level for efciency and efectiveness.

###### a)ISO Headquarter and Field Stations
There is need to acquire land and construct the Headquarter and feld Stations countrywide. The building is in a sorry state and may endanger the personnel, information and property. Modern Hotels and
Residential Apartments surround the building making it vulnerable. There is inadequate ofce space for
the required staf at headquarters, which has caused the management to rent extra ofces in elsewhere,
which is costly.
It will Cost; Shs 29, 625,000,000 (Inclusive of purchase of land for Land for head quarter and feld stations
at Shs 5,925,000,000).

###### b)Communication Equipment

The security sector will continue to build on the successes achieved in the past three decades. In particular, focus is on building capacity to cause deterrence, and be able to deal with both internal and external
threats decisively once deterrence fails. Whereas the sector will avoid being provoked into unnecessary
and diversionary military conficts over the irrational colonial borders, preferring use of dialogue and
international arbitration solutions, it remains prepared to defeat any external aggressor.
The peace and stability being enjoyed throughout Uganda will continue to be maintained and consolidated. Given the intertwined relationship between Security and Development, there is no doubt that
the peaceful and secure Uganda will continue with her onward match to socio-economic prosperity.

### SECTION FOUR: INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS
# FOR IMPLEMENTING THE SECTOR PLAN

 4.1 Introduction
Management is principally concerned with the efcient use of resources in order to achieve desired
outcomes. The responsibility of policy formulation, planning, budgeting and overseeing the implementation to achieve sector objectives lies in specifc MDAs institutions, and at national levels. It is equally
important that security management pursues efectiveness, efciency and professionalism and at the
same time aligns the sector with the cultural values and norms of Uganda.
Several institutional arrangements are in place to implement the sector plan. These include:

# 4.3 Parliament
In the case of security sector the taxpaying public supplies the resources and should therefore also have
a say in the process, outputs and outcomes of the sector through their elected representatives (Parliament). The Constitution mandates the Parliament to regulate the security sector by making laws regulating the sector, appropriating the resources as well as playing the oversight role to the sector. The oversight role is through the work of both parliamentary committee on Defence and Internal Afairs and
plenary sittings, as well as hearings during the parliamentary stage of security related bills. MPs have
numerous ways for carrying out oversight role including scrutinizing policy statements, questioning to
Ministers/accounting ofcers and undertaking feld inspection visits. Additionally, parliament authorizes deployment of the UPDF outside Uganda.

# 4.2 National Security Council
The National Security Council (NSC) is established by the National Security Council Act 2000 and is
chaired by the President. NSC has a broad representation from MDAs including the Ministries of Internal
Afairs, Foreign Afairs, Defence, Security, Finance and the Attorney General. It also has, as ex-ofcio
members, the heads of security organs and departments e.g. the UPDF, the Inspector General of Police,
ESO, ISO, Special Branch, CMI, CIID, and Prison services. The Council’s main functions are to:

- Inform and advise the President on matters relating to national security;

- Co-ordinate and advise on policy matters relating to intelligence and security;

- Review national security needs and goals;

- Receive and act on reports from the Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC);

- Carry out any other function as the parliament may oblige to the council.

# 4.3 Security Policy Framework
The Security Policy Framework (SPF) develops a common understanding of security problems that
Uganda may face 10-15 years ahead. The SPF paper determines the MDAs that have a role to play in
addressing the security threat and clarifes each MDA’s responsibilities in order to improve co-ordination
so that the government can respond more efectively. It also clarifes Uganda’s approach to security for
the beneft of neighbouring countries with whom Uganda has common security interests, as well as
inform other key stakeholders about how the security question fts into Uganda’s broader development
plans.


###### SECURITY SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PLAN 2015/16 - 2019/20


### 35


-----

# 4.4 East African Standby Force (EASF)
The African Union (AU) Peace and Security Council Protocol (2002) Article 12 acknowledges the fact that
the scourge of conficts in Africa impedes socio-economic development. The AU, therefore established
the African Peace and Security Architecture (APSA) aimed at Confict Prevention, Management and
Resolution (CPMR), as well as post-confict reconstruction on the African continent. African Standby
Force (ASF) is one of the mechanisms under the APSA specifcally for peace keeping. As part of ASF, Eastern African countries established Eastern Africa Standby Force (EASF). The mission of EASF is to develop
capability to contribute to regional and continental Peace by efectively and rapidly responding to
crises. Since 2007 when EASF was established, Uganda has fully supported and participated in all activities. By end of 2015 EASF capability to respond to security crisis was fully developed and launched.

# 4.5 EAC Defence and Security Protocol
Since inception in 1999, the East African Community (EAC) has taken bold steps to create a framework
and structures to address issues of Peace and Security. Apart from the Republic of South Sudan that was
admitted to the EAC regional block recently, the other fve partner states have adopted and ratifed a
protocol on cooperation in Defence and Security matters. The protocol, among other things, enhances
collaboration in areas of combating and preventing terrorism, Confict Prevention, Management and
Resolution (CPMR), Human and Drug trafcking, stopping Small Arms and Light Weapons (SALW) proliferation, as well as ensuring joint trainings, military exercises, joint operations, technical cooperation,
experts working group meetings and visits/exchange programmes.

# 4.6 Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC) and Joint Operations Committee (JOC)
As provided for by the National Security Council Act, Uganda’s civil and military intelligence work
together under the framework of JIC to gather and analyse intelligence information, and timely report
on the threat situation. JIC shares analysed information with JOC to enable the latter act spontaneously
to deter the adversaries from realizing their objectives.

# 4.7 Top Management Committee
In the Ministry of Defence, the Top Management Committee (TMC) is responsible for strategic direction
for the ministry and is chaired by the Minister of Defence. TMC is also mandated with policy formulation
and supervision of activities and operations of the Ministry. Membership for TMC include; the Permanent Secretary, Chief of Defence Forces, Commander Land Forces, Commander Air Force and the Joint
Chief Of Staf. ISO and ESO also have respective Senior Management Committees with similar responsibilities.

# 4.8 Defence Forces Council
The Defence Forces Council is the highest policy-making organ of the UPDF and is chaired by the Commander-in-Chief or any other person delegated to do so. The roles of the council include advising the
President on all matters connected with the Control and Administration as well as giving professional
advice on defence policy generally and all the deployment of the Defence Forces.


###### SECURITY SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PLAN 2015/16 - 2019/20


### 36


-----

# 4.9 Command and Staf
Command and Staf is chaired by the CDF and formulates policy for consideration and approval by the
high command and the Defence Force Council.

# 4.10 Security Committees and Intelligence Committees
As a way of ensuring national peace and stability, security committees were established at district and
sub-county levels by the National Security Council Act 2000. These committees receive, analyse and
share information concerning potential threats in their areas; and take appropriate actions or recommend options to decision makers.

# 4.11 Policy and Administration Committees (PAC)
All UPDF units and formations have Policy and Administration Committees (PAC) aimed at maintaining
clear channels of communication between the various levels of the force. UPDF commanders and commandants have a responsibility to regularly hold PAC meetings to explain policy decisions from top
echelons, to discuss various issues afecting the force and to solicit for proposals to solve problems.

# 4.12 Security Sector Working Group (SWG)
The Security Sector Working Group (SWG) chaired by the Ministry of Defence being the sector leader
and meetings are held at two levels, namely, technical and steering. The SWG works closely with NPA to
ensure that policy description and plans thereof are within general direction and resource envelope
(MTEF).

### SECTION FIVE: THE SSDP FINANCING STRATEGY

# 5.0 Introduction
The sector plan is estimated to cost UGX 17 trillion in the next fve Financial Years. It is expected that the
expenditures will be based on timeliness and sustainability of interventions and project implementation.
The SSDP anticipates relying on a reliable fnancing model whereby the government will mainly be the
major source of funds. However, consultations on alternative sources fnancing will also be explored.
Therefore, the SSDP will be fnanced through 3 ways including:
a) Government funding
b) External fnancing
c) Public Private Partnerships.

# 5.1 Government funds
These are annualized funds from government to all Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs). These
are reliable since they are sure means of fnancing. However, they are insufcient to implement all interventions provided in the SSDP.

# 5.2 External fnancing
External fnancing in the security sector is uncommon, though specifcally the UPDF is receiving external
fnancing from mainly African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) and the United Nations Guard Unit
(UNGU); but this only covers wage and operational expenses. These operations are mainly for ensuring
regional peace and security.

# 5.3 Public Private Partnerships (PPP)
These innovative ways of tapping non-conventional sources of fnancing will be explored starting with
barracks construction involving 30,000 housing units, Acacia Mess and Chiefs Block. The MoDVA Public
Private Partnership team will be formed and an adviser procured for each transaction.

# 5.4 Costing of the SSDP
The SSDP has been costed mainly in anticipation of government funds. Therefore, the cost matrix has
been divided into two to include; recurrent expenses as per Ministry of Finance Planning and Economic
Development (MoFPED) annual releases, and the Projects which will be undertaken with increased funding.

### SECTION SIX: MONITORING AND EVALUATION
# ARRANGEMENTS

 6.0 Introduction
Participatory Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) is an important element of development policy formulation and implementation which the security sector is committed to. Monitoring of projects within the
security sector is a continuous process of systematic data collection while Evaluation entails a systematic
and objective assessment of on-going or completed interventions and the resulting impacts.
Implementation of SSDP shall require enhanced collaboration and coordination of actors within the
sector and outside it, at all levels. Additionally, timely approval of derivative sub-sector plans by the
relevant authorities will be critical in ensuring efective implementation of SSDP as well as serving as a
strategic control mechanism to ensure commitment to achieving set goals and objectives.
Like for other sectors, the security sector through the accounting ofcers enforces implementation the
plan with special focus on monitoring fnancial and physical implementation through reviews on both
quarterly and annual basis.

# 6.1 Monitoring and Evaluation of SSDP
Efective mechanism for monitoring and evaluating the implementation of the Development plan will
be important for achievement of the anticipated sector objectives. In particular M&E in security sector
will:
a) Ensure that the interventions being carried out conform to the development plan
b) Ensure that the results being achieved are aligned with the set objectives
c) Serve as an "early warning system and gives an opportunity for all implementers to communicate
how they are doing where the problems and opportunities lie
d) Provide a regular information to all stakeholders on the progress of implementation and aid
informed decision making
e) Allow corrective action and fne tuning “not only the interventions, but the planning process
leading to improved performance
f) Demonstrate public accountability and transparency in the implementation of the sector
projects and programs
g) Promote learning, feedback, and knowledge sharing on results and lessons learned among
implementers.
h) The emphasis of the M&E system for SSDP will be monitoring of outputs, outcomes and impact
rather than inputs and activities. Regular monitoring will focus on the following issues:
i) Activities being implemented within set timelines and progress being made
j) The extent to which the desired results are being achieved  in relation to set targets
k) Changes in the strategic security environment and whether the assumptions still hold.
See the results framework on next page.
