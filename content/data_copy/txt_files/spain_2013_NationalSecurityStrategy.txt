## THE NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY

#### Sharing a Common Project


-----

Security is a cornerstone of development and progress in a free society. A basic
and widespread understanding of the importance of security as a guarantee of
citizens’ well-being and the stability of the State itself is therefore essential.

This vision can only be articulated through a Strategy that defines a global and
all-embracing frame of reference in security matters; a Strategy that envisages
the unique characteristics of the risks and threats we face in a world that is
undergoing changes as deep as they are constant; a Strategy that orients the
State’s action towards responding to current challenges by using the available
resources flexibly and efficiently; a Strategy that enhances our prevention,
protection and response capabilities in an increasingly complex environment
like today’s.

Added to the traditional risks and threats are new, generally transnational ones
which are interconnected and increase their danger; and at the same time new
gaps are emerging that facilitate their spread and impact. Today cyberspace
is the clearest example of an area that is accessible, loosely regulated and
difficult to control and cybersecurity is therefore one of the main areas of action
covered by this Strategy.

Spain, as a Mediterranean European Union Member State with a privileged
but complex geographical location, has a clear-cut profile of its own. These
particular characteristics define our specific strategic objectives. On the basis of
defending these interests and strategic values, Spain’s projection in the global
environment is aimed at pursuing and promoting international stability, peace
and security.

The 2013 National Security Strategy provides a comprehensive vision of
National Security. A responsible society aware of its security is better poised to
address today’s challenges and gain in development and prosperity. The 2013
National Security Strategy is progressing along these lines, as it considers it
essential to encourage the involvement of citizens and collaboration between
the public and private sectors and all the Public Authorities in their areas of


-----

responsibility, because today’s risks and threats are not unconnected and
cannot be addressed through isolated responses. Guaranteeing security is a
responsibility of the Government, but it is also a task of everyone.

Strategic thought provides a broad picture of the security environment and
allows us to be better prepared for possible risks and future threats. But this
is not enough. It is necessary to prioritise available resources effectively and
organise decision-making through an institutional system that is a sum total
at the service of everyone and ensures integrated, effective and coordinated
action in all fields of security. In order to meet this objective, this Strategy
provides for a new institutional structure equipped to tackle strategic security and
crisis-management issues requiring a rapid, coordinated and comprehensive
response. Implementing this new National Security System at the service of
everyone furthermore involves a high degree of commitment and public will.

The 2013 National Security Strategy is a significant step. It continues and
revises the Spanish Security Strategy approved in 2011, adapting and updating
its content in accordance with the changes in the strategic landscape, shaping a
new National Security System and involving civil society in the areas of priority
interest to National Security. It is based on the idea that National Security is
a public service which must be the subject of a State Policy that is sustained
over time, capable of going beyond the timeframes and political agendas of
each Government. Its implementation will provide the Government with the
necessary means to protect its citizens and defend the State.

The possibilities of a secure Spain and a strong, determined society are
unlimited. With this 2013 National Security Strategy we are all moving in the
right direction.

###### Executive Summary


he National Security Strategy is
a revision of the Spanish Security

### T

Strategy of 2011. As an instrument of its
time, it reflects the risks and threats that
need to be addressed in a world undergoing
profound and constant change. It takes a
broad view of the concept of security, in
accordance with these global changes which
affect the State and citizens’ daily lives.

The Strategy is structured into five

chapters which provide a concept of
National Security, place Spain’s security
in a global context, identify current risks
and threats, establish the objectives and
strategic lines of action for Spain in the
priority areas of action on the basis of
the foregoing, and shape a new National
Security System.

The first chapter, _A_ _Comprehensive_

_Vision of National Security, describes the_
current security environment. It provides
a comprehensive, wide-ranging definition
of National Security, which is taken to


mean State action aimed at protecting
the freedom and well-being of its citizens,
guaranteeing the defence of Spain and its
constitutional principles and values, and
contributing together with our partners and
allies to international security in compliance
with the commitments undertaken.

National Security is a public service

subject to a State Policy. Under the
direction and leadership of the Prime
Minister, it involves all the Public Authorities
and requires the collaboration of society
as a whole.

Furthermore, this chapter lists the

basic principles of the Strategy which will
determine the National Security guidelines:
unity of action; anticipation and prevention;
efficiency and sustainability in the use of
resources; and resilience – which is taken
to mean the ability of human and material
resources to address crisis situations
flexibly and forcibly and overcome them
by minimising and cushioning their negative


-----

consequences.

The second chapter, _Spain’s Security_

_in the World, examines Spain’s security_
in a globalised, highly competitive and
constantly changing world that poses
major risks and threats but also provides
major opportunities to an open, advanced
and formed society like Spain’s. It identifies
our country’s strategic environments: the
European Union (EU), the Mediterranean,
Latin America, the United States and
transatlantic relations, Africa, Asia, Australia
and Russia. It also deals with the United
Nations (UN), the North Atlantic

Treaty Organization (NATO) and other
multilateral forums.

Progress in building Europe is a

guarantee of greater security and

prosperity for Europe. Strengthening
effective mechanisms for economic

and financial governance and advancing
towards political integration are objectives
which Spain shares and promotes.

Furthermore, a democratic, stable and

more developed Mediterranean is the best
guarantee of security for all the countries
in the region. Together with the EU and the
international community, Spain will back
the efforts of the countries in this area to
achieve these objectives and will contribute
to seeking a fair solution to conflicts.

With respect to Latin America, it is in

Spain’s interests to accompany this region
of great strategic importance – with


which Spain maintains a singularly deeprooted relationship – in the changes it
is experiencing. In particular, Brazil and
Mexico, two of Spain’s major strategic
partners in the region, are consolidating
their status of global actors and the Pacific
Alliance has the potential to provide a link
between Spain and the Asia-Pacific region.

Relations with the United States, the other

pillar of Spain’s relations with the Americas,
are a key to the management of the EuroAtlantic area. The United States is one of
our main allies and an indispensable and
priority partner in managing the challenges
and opportunities of the globalised world.
The significant growth in its Spanishspeaking population is a determining factor
in relations with this country. A broadranging vision of transatlantic relations that
includes Canada – an actor to be very much
taken into consideration – will allow shared
challenges to be addressed more effectively.

As for Africa, Spain takes part in

initiatives designed to tackle the extreme
poverty and underdevelopment that
ravage some of the countries of the
continent. Addicionally, the Sahel, the Horn
of Africa and the Gulf of Guinea are areas
of vital importance to Spain’s security.

Asia is at the centre of the geopolitical

shift that heralds the world to come.
Spain must work bilaterally and in the
framework of the EU to protect and
promote its interests by strengthening
its ties and relations with this continent.


-----

The focal points of tension in Afghanistan,
Pakistan and North Korea and those
related to China’s territorial claims affect
the whole international community. Spain
must foster the consolidation of Asian
security structures, enhance its presence
in the region and increase the already
intense collaboration with the existing
security organisations. Australia, a country
with which important agreements have
been reached in strategic sectors, is also
of key significance in this effort.

The National Security Strategy also

refers to Russia’s position as the EU’s largest
neighbour and a fundamental strategic
actor of great importance to the European
energy market.

Global challenges and threats must

be addressed with global solutions
developed in an international community
where cooperation and multilateral action
are established as basic organisational
principles. In this sense, the UN continues
to be the lead organisation for peace
keeping and worldwide cooperation and
international security.

The third chapter, _Risks and Threats to_

_National Security, describes the risks and_
threats which particularly affect National
Security: armed conflicts, terrorism,

cyberthreats, organised crime, economic


and financial instability, energy vulnerability,
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction,
irregular migratory flows, espionage,

emergencies and disasters, vulnerability of
maritime space, and vulnerability of critical
infrastructures and essential services. It also
examines risk multipliers such as climate
change, poverty, inequality, ideological
extremism, demographic imbalances and
the spread of the misuse of new technology
which, although not risks or threats in
themselves, may trigger or worsen them.

In consonance with these risks and threats,

the fourth chapter, _Strategic Lines of Action,_
establishes twelve priority areas of action. It
defines for each one the main objective to be
achieved and several strategic lines of action,
which will provide the framework for the
particular responses and actions required
to preserve security. These are specific lines
tailored to the characteristics of each area
of action, although they all involve publicprivate collaboration, fostering a security
culture, optimising available resources and
strengthening international cooperation.

The Strategy takes a convergent

approach. It considers that today’s challenges
call for a new National Security System – a
strong national system capable of adapting
to change and to security contingencies
– in order to provide an effective and
comprehensive response to the complex


-----

challenges that preserving security in today’s
world requires.

The fifth chapter, A _New National_

_Security System, develops this system, the_
main purpose of which is to preserve
National Security through the optimal,
integrated and flexible functioning of all
the resources available for this purpose.
The system will consist of the National
Security Committee and the Specialised
Committees.

The dynamism of the environment

and the national situation will require the
National Security Strategy to be constantly
updated and periodically revised.


-----

###### Chapter 1 A comprehensive vision of National Security

 The first chapter of the National Security Strategy provides an overview of the current security environment. National Security is defined comprehensively and broadly and is conceived as a public service subject to a State Policy, which requires the collaboration of society as a whole. Under the direction and leadership of the Prime Minister, National Security is the responsibility of the Government and involves all the Public Authorities. The chapter identifies the basic principles of the Strategy, which will determine the National Security guidelines.

ocieties that take responsibility for their security are freer societies. Security, as an
essential component in defending constitutional values and achieving the ideals of

### S

justice, prosperity and progress, is a cornerstone of the preservation, stability and continuity
of the State, as well as of the lives and well-being of its citizens.

The concept of security has evolved in keeping with global changes in order to address

the growing challenges posed by the circumstances of the

factors such as the constant shifting of power centres, with

-----

the rise of new powers; the consolidation of new international actors; the greater ability
of individuals to influence; demographic changes; greater competition for energy, food and
economic resources; the role of technology in the knowledge society; and greater economic,
political and legal interdependence.

Therefore, there are new risks and threats to address. Together with traditional ones

like armed conflicts, others that are essentially transnational emerge and feed into each
other and, through their interaction, increase their dangerousness and the vulnerability of the
environment. Other elements that add complexity to the risks and threats of the current
strategic context are their cross-cutting impact on different State and social structures and
actors, the difficulty of identifying their origin, and the absence of a single centre of gravity.
International terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, organised crime,
cyberattacks and espionage are just a few examples.

The concept of security in the 21st century must be broad and dynamic in order to

cover all the areas which concern the security of the State and its citizens; these vary in
accordance with rapid developments in the strategic environment and range from territorial
defence to economic and financial stability or the protection of critical infrastructures.

Furthermore, both national and multilateral cooperation are required to respond to

the risks and threats which compromise security in this day and age. Unilateral and isolated
responses, as they are incomplete and partial, are not effective against challenges which
require a multidisciplinary approach and joint action. Only this perspective encompasses all
the aspects which are potentially or actually affected.

Changes and trends in the security environment, its dimensions, and the responses

required to preserve it are factors that influence the vision of National Security. Spain is
among the most advanced countries in this field and views security comprehensively in
accordance with the global changes that have repercussions on the State and citizens’ daily
life. In this connection the financial and economic crisis currently affecting Spain, the euro
zone and many world economies is one of the biggest challenges to National Security and
emphasises the need to respond efficiently.

In accordance with this comprehensive vision, National Security is the State action aimed

at protecting the freedom and well-being of its citizens, guaranteeing the defence of Spain
and its constitutional principles and values, and contributing together with our partners and
allies to international security in compliance with the commitments undertaken.


-----

In our country the constitutional mandate to guarantee democratic coexistence within

the framework of the Constitution and Spanish Law and to protect citizens in the free
exercise of their rights and public freedoms is facilitated by a public security system based
chiefly on two State forces, one civilian (the National Police Force) and one military (the Civil
_Guard [Guardia Civil]). Together with the regional and local police forces, they are responsible_
for safeguarding citizen security.

Guaranteeing National Security requires commitment and responsibility at the highest

political level. The Prime Minister will lead and promote the National Security Policy and,
under his direction, the Government will be responsible for its effective enforcement, involving
the Central Government Authorities, the Regional Authorities and the Local Authorities –
which must cooperate in a spirit of solidarity and institutional loyalty – as well as all citizens.

National Security is a public service which must be subject to a State Policy. By its nature

it is a task to which everyone must be committed. To this end, the Government will strive
to secure the maximum social and parliamentary support.

Citizens’ collaboration and support are essential. This involvement will be possible if a

sound security culture is fostered based on prior knowledge, awareness and sensitivity to
the importance of security in guaranteeing their freedom, prosperity and, in short, their way
of life in accordance with the principles of the social and democratic rule of law.

The National Security Policy requires the planning and definition of permanent principles

and lines of action capable of providing
comprehensive responses to current threats. It

###### The basic principles of the Strategy are:


**1. UNITY OF ACTION,**
which means the involvement, coordination
and harmonisation of all State actors and
resources under the direction of the
Prime Minister, as well as public-private
collaboration and the involvement of
society in general. The comprehensive
approach to security, encompassing all its
dimensions, accounts for this principle of
action and must in turn be fully managed
through a National Security System that is
promoted and led by the Prime Minister;

**2. ANTICIPATION AND PREVENTION,**
which must guide Government action
in detecting situations that may pose a
potential risk or threat to National Security
and steering them back on track;;


**3. EFFICIENT AND SUSTAINABLE USE**
**OF RESOURCES,**
a principle which must govern

administrative action at all times but is
especially significant in a context like the
present one. It is based on prioritising
resources and optimising their use, requires
results to be monitored and assessed, and
guides administrative organisation;

**4. RESILIENCE OR ABILITY TO RESIST**
**AND RECOVER**
a principle relating to the ability of human
and material resources to address crisis
situations flexibly and forcibly and tackle
them by minimising and cushioning their
negative consequences.


The dynamism of the environment and the situation of the country will require constant
updating and periodic revisions.

###### Chapter 2
 Spain’s security in the world

 The second chapter of the National Security Strategy addresses the security of Spain in a globalised, highly competitive and constantly changing world that poses significant risks and threats but also provides major opportunities for an open, advanced and formed society like Spain’s. It identifies our country’s strategic environments as: the EU, the Mediterranean, Latin America, the United States and transatlantic relations, Africa, Asia, Australia and Russia. It also deals with the UN, NATO and other multilateral forums. It highlights the influence of Spain’s particular characteristics on National Security in this context.

efending Spain’s vital and strategic interests in the world is a primary objective of
National Security. The international dimensions of National Security are crucial. A world

or global predominance – in short, a multipolar world
– is more complex and difficult to manage. Spain must

emerging world do not yet point to clear boundaries
for the new international community.

interdependence – directly affect security.

On the other, at the same time changes

modify the strategic environment and may bring new and very important opportunities
for an open, advanced and formed society like Spain’s. Individuals’ ability to interact as if
borders did not exist, the rapid transmission of huge amounts of information and social
networking are just some of these opportunities.

Spain must be poised to respond appropriately to conflict situations, which can spur the

transitions characteristic of today’s world. This response must take advantage of its strengths.

The security and well-being of Spain and its citizens are determined and developed

within and beyond our borders, as challenges to security are transnational. Therefore Spain
must project itself overseas, either individually or together with its partners and allies. It is
no longer possible to distinguish between external and internal security. Events that occur
beyond national borders can have a direct impact on our country.

Spain projects itself externally as a country with a clear-cut profile of its own, that of

a major State as old as international society. This profile is due in part to its particular
geographical location between Europe and North Africa and between the Mediterranean
and the Atlantic and as a State that includes the mainland, the Balearic and Canary
archipelagos and the two Autonomous Cities of Ceuta and Melilla. Indeed, owing to
Spain’s privileged and complex geostrategic position, its regional and global projection is
oriented towards the pursuit of international stability, peace and security.

Europe and the Mediterranean are our major strategic priorities. The future of Spain and

the security and well-being of its citizens are largely linked to the development of these
regions. Latin America is the other focal point of our international projection. Together
with this region, Africa poses significant security challenges and must continue to be
given preferential attention. Spain’s membership of various security organisations entails


-----

responsibilities and duties to our partners and allies and, accordingly, possible actions in this
field. Finally, a strategic priority is to ensure that our country is duly prepared and able to
tackle threats that need to be addressed autonomously.

Spain’s position is also the result of a constitutional system based on freedom and
respect for human dignity, with an advanced democracy, a deeply globalised economy and
a language which is shared by hundreds of millions of people as a vehicle for culture and
civilisation.

###### 1. The European Union

To progress in building Europe is to make Spain

more secure and prosperous. Spain’s interests
will be better protected if the EU is strengthened
internally and in its external dimension.

Uncertainty about the progress of political and economic integration considerably

weakens the Union. Addressing and finding a solution to this situation is a determining
factor for our security.

For this purpose, the EU must develop effective mechanisms for economic and

financial governance and bolster elements of political union. Strengthening Economic and
Monetary Union (EMU) and advancing towards political integration are objectives which
Spain shares and promotes.

Externally, Spain’s security will be strengthened if the EU becomes consolidated as a

global actor. To this end it is necessary to reinforce and fully deploy the European External
Action Service (EEAS) that represents the EU throughout the world; to develop the
Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) equipped with appropriate and credible
military resources; and to fully develop the different capabilities of the Area of Freedom,
Security and Justice (AFSJ). In particular, the EU is the only organisation in the world in a
position to combine civilian and military means in crisis management.

The experience of conflicts in recent decades indicates to what extent the ability to act

in this comprehensive manner is the only way of successfully addressing their resolution.
The EU must make further and deeper progress in this field in order to contribute to the
security of Europe and Spain.

Spain supports the process of EU enlargement. The experience of history shows

that the accession of new members has contributed
considerably to the stability and security of the continent.

with France, they make up a series of elements of key importance to the stability and
security of Spain, in addition to a significant contribution to the security of Europe and its
neighbouring regions.

The British colony of Gibraltar is an anomaly in today’s Europe and a dysfunction in

relations between two partner countries and allies. It poses security problems to Spain and

Europe in several areas, which require effective
solutions in accordance with the parameters
established by the United Nations and laid
down in the Brussels Declaration signed by the
Spanish and British governments in 1984.

###### 2. The Mediterranean

Peace, stability and prosperity on the southern shore of the Mediterranean are

priorities for National Security and for the security of Europe as a whole. Our strategic
environment is undergoing transformation as a result of the processes of change, whose
main consequence to date has been the democratic election of governments that are
accountable to their citizens. All transitions are complex and entail opportunities and risks.
The exclusion of social groups or the use of violence to secure political advantages can
create a highly unstable environment with very negative consequences for the countries
of the southern shore and the security of the whole region.

Spain, together with the EU and the international community, will back the efforts

made by the countries in the area to achieve greater social and economic development
and greater political stability. A stable, democratic Mediterranean with higher levels of
prosperity is the best guarantee of security for all the countries in the region. However,
the political instability and absence of economic prospects of much of these countries’
populations are factors that have direct repercussions on the security of the Sahel and
can affect Spain and Europe.

The Maghreb is of particular interest to Spain. In collaboration with the countries

of the region, we must provide a response to challenges common to both shores,
such as promoting the Rule of Law; economic development and social cohesion; the
consolidation of economic models that foster the inclusion of all citizens; the stabilisation
of energy supplies; the regulation and control of migratory flows; and combating

through the impetus and leadership of broader
cooperation frameworks such as the Union for

the Mediterranean, the European Neighbourhood Policy and other forums like the ‘5+5
Initiative’, the Mediterranean Dialogue of the NATO and the Istanbul Cooperation Initiative
of 2004.

The Mediterranean continues to witness old and highly complex conflicts that affect

everyone’s security. Recent crises such as that of Libya and, specifically, that of Syria are a
reminder of the fragility of what is a sensitive area in security terms. In particular, in the
framework of the EU Spain will continue to work towards a permanent solution to the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict in accordance with the agreed parameters. In addition, with
respect to the question of Western Sahara, Spain, in accordance with the United Nations
resolutions and as a member of the Group of Friends, will keep its active commitment to
achieving a fair, lasting solution that is mutually acceptable to the parties. Spain will likewise
contribute to a fair and lasting solution to the problem of Cyprus and will collaborate
with Turkey as a regional actor important to the security and stability of the Eastern
Mediterranean.

###### 3. Latin America

Latin America is a region of great strategic

importance with which Spain maintains political,
economic, historical and cultural relations that
are singularly deep-rooted, significant and
intense. Latin America is changing rapidly and

deeply as the result of a dynamic political and economic process. Brazil and Mexico, two of
Spain’s major strategic partners in the region, are consolidating their status of global actors.

It is also a key region of the Pacific, a highly significant area in the new strategic landscape. In

particular the Pacific Alliance founded by Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru, which account for
forty percent of Spain’s trade and investment in Latin America, is of great importance to Spain’s

strategic and political interests. The Pacific
Alliance is generating increasing trade and **_‘Latin America is a region of great_**

Spain as an Observer State, a status which
allows it to take part in the annual summit
meetings of presidents and in several integration and projection initiatives in the Asia-Pacific
region.

In addition, the common language facilitates cultural exchange, work, trade and our

citizens’ interests in the continent. It has also encouraged immigration in both directions,
which has enriched both sides and is creating new links and shared interests.

Problems such as institutional fragility, legal uncertainty, the power of criminal groups,

narcoterrorism and human trafficking still remain in some Latin American countries. They
are complex challenges which also affect Spain. Bilateral action, regional forums, the EU and
the Ibero-American Summits should help address these challenges.

###### 4. The United States and Transatlantic Relations

Peace, stability and security in the Euro-

Atlantic area are part of Spain’s security. Relations
with the United States, the other cornerstone
of our relations with the Americas, are of key

importance in managing this area and one of the main assets of the international dimension
of our security. The United States is one of our most important allies and an essential
and priority partner for managing the challenges and opportunities that arise in the
globalised world. The significant growth of the United States’ Spanish-speaking population
is a determining factor in these relations.

The United States is the main dialogue partner in the objective of achieving a broad

vision of transatlantic relations that takes into account security in both America and the
African continent. This vision, which includes a closer relationship with Canada – an actor to

African continent which must be articulated
through cooperation relations. The economic
development of some countries of Sub-Saharan
Africa is providing them with an opportunity

and a hope: the possibility of joining the global economy and leaving behind poverty and
underdevelopment. At the same time Africa poses problems of stability and unresolved
conflicts which occasionally threaten the very existence of some States.

Extreme poverty continues to ravage significant parts of the continent. It is also the

continent that is most vulnerable to the perverse consequences of climate change.
Environmental factors are already causing mass population displacements and conflicts
associated mainly with the shortage of water and the exploitation of resources.

Three areas will be vital to Spanish interests in the coming decades: the Sahel, the Horn

of Africa and the Gulf of Guinea. Boosting our security involves working with our partners
and allies in all these areas.

Illegal trafficking, ethnic conflicts, terrorism, failed States, underdevelopment and ideological

extremism converge in the first two.

The vastness of the Sahel and the fragility of its States are converting the region into

a seedbed of interethnic conflicts and foster the proliferation of criminal networks and
jihadist terrorist groups. The action carried out in Mali – which combines material support
for its armed forces in combating terrorism, cooperation in strengthening its security forces
and assistance in bolstering the State structures and the capabilities of civilian society –
shows the major possibilities of cooperation with these countries in order to reinforce their
security and our own

###### of Guinea’

With respect to the Gulf of Guinea, lack of

stability in the area can also generate maritime insecurity, which has highly negative effects
on energy supply and trade flows.

###### 6. Asia

Spain will only be able to defend its security

properly and protect and promote its interests
by reinforcing its links and relations with this
continent. For this purpose Spain must work
bilaterally and in the framework of the EU. Asia

is at the centre of the geopolitical shift that heralds the world to come. Some of its large
countries – China in particular – are becoming consolidated as poles of influence in the
emerging international community and are set to become key elements in the new strategic
landscape.

The focal points of tension in Afghanistan, Pakistan and North Korea and those linked

to China’s territorial claims affect the whole international community. At the same time, the
economic growth of large countries like China and India, which have also become significant
actors in Africa or Latin America, is a stability factor.

Spain must foster the consolidation of Asian

-----

its already intense collaboration with the strategic countries’ security organisations in
counterterrorism, immigration control and defence matters. Australia, a country with
which important agreements have been reached in strategic sectors, is also of key
significance in this endeavour.

###### 7. Russia

Russia is the EU’s largest neighbour and a

key strategic actor of great importance to the
European energy market. Cooperating with
Moscow is essential to Europe’s security and
stability. For this purpose Russia must contribute
to settling longstanding conflicts in the strategic

environment it shares with the Union, as this will
enhance the democratic stability of the countries
involved and the security of everyone.

###### ‘Russia is the EU’s largest neighbour and a key Russia must consolidate its role as a strategic partner strategic actor’ of the EU. Strengthening this position will have a positive

effect on the security of Spain and its partners and
NATO allies and on global governance.

###### 8. The United Nations, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and Other Multilateral Forum

Spain’s security and interests are better guaranteed in an international community where

cooperation, collective decision making and multilateral action are basic organisational
principles. Global challenges and threats can only have global solutions. In this connection
Spain will continue to promote and give impetus to common forums for meeting and
dialogue.

The UN is still the most significant organisation for world cooperation and the maintenance

of international peace and security. In order for it to continue to be so, however, it requires
a thorough reform. Spain is working towards the implementation of this reform.


-----

In the Euro-Atlantic area NATO is a **_‘Global challenges and threats can_**

determining factor for regional security and **_only have global solutions’_**
represents an essential dimension of our
defence. To preserve its effectiveness, it must
carry on adapting to a changing reality in which risks and threats are constantly increasing and
becoming diversified. To this end it must perform the three basic tasks established by its new
strategic concept in a balanced manner and with a broad vision of security: collective defence,
crisis management and cooperative security.

The reduction in the Defence budget of the Alliance countries and the parallel increase

in military expenditure or the investment maintained in other countries are leading to a
strategic imbalance. To Spain, this poses a double challenge in that it decreases the collective
umbrella of deterrence and makes it more difficult to ensure vital capabilities of its own with
which to address risks and threats.

Other security organisations, such as the Organization for Security and Cooperation

in Europe (OSCE), constitute appropriate frameworks for promoting confidence-building
measures or continuing to encourage the process of disarmament and arms control, which
will lead to greater security for Spain.

Our presence in the G-20 and the Financial Stability Board grants Spain a role in global

economic and financial governance which allows us to contribute to the existence of a global
and secure environment that promotes trade, investment and sustainable development.

###### Chapter 3 Risks and threats to National Security


###### The third chapter of the National Security Strategy describes the risks and threats that particularly affect National Security. It also examines the multiplier factors which, although not risks or threats in themselves, may trigger or worsen them.

oexisting in the international environment alongside risks and threats are other
multiplier factors which can generate new risks or threats or multiply and worsen their

### C

effects. Poverty, inequality, ideological extremism, demographic imbalance, climate change
and widespread misuse of new technology are some of these factors.


In particular, by way of example, climate change is the major environmental and

socioeconomic challenge of the 21[st] century. It poses challenges of far-reaching importance
to security, such as shortage of drinking water, major changes in the conditions of food
production, greater competition for energy resources and an increase in certain natural
disasters such as floods, storms, droughts, forest fires and heat waves. These environmental
changes can exacerbate migratory pressure and accordingly heighten tension in areas of
transit and destination, and even increase the fragility of some States.

Climate change is a key element which can become a threat multiplier. However, it

also provides an opportunity to shape a new, more sustainable model of development.

###### 1. Armed Conflicts

Armed conflicts continue to pose a major threat

to security, even though global interdependence **_‘Global interdependence_**
has influenced their form and decreased the **_has currently decreased the_**
likelihood of conventional confrontations between **_likelihood of conventional_**
States. Most violent conflicts are internal. Examples

###### but armed conflicts continue to

###### pose a major threat to security’

conflicts and competition for natural resources.
Despite the internal nature of these conflicts, their
consequences affect the international community
and, in some cases, vital and strategic Spanish interests and, accordingly, National Security.

Furthermore, armed conflicts can multiply other risks and threats to the security of the

international community as a whole and to Spanish National Security in that they facilitate
the illegal trafficking or uncontrolled spread of weapons. As a result, instability increases not
only in the territories directly involved, but also in neighbouring areas.

All these circumstances make it necessary to be aware of the nature of future conflicts

in order to adapt the capabilities, organisation and action procedures of the Armed Forces
accordingly. What is more, both cyberspace and outer space have become domains where
confrontation is possible.

In the short term the economic and financial crisis and its impact on Defence budgets in

the West may bring greater reluctance towards military interventions, although some will be
inevitable. The tendency is for them to be limited actions.

The use of our Armed Forces can prove essential in conflicts that may develop both

within and beyond our borders.

On the one hand, Spain must maintain a credible and effective defence capability of its

own, given its geographical location.

On the other hand, Spain must be capable of taking part in crises or conflicts as a

supportive partner of the international organisations to which it belongs, as well as in
peacekeeping, civilian protection or other operations that affect our shared values and stem
from commitments to international organisations such as the UN.


-----

###### 2. Terrorism

Terrorism is a direct threat to the life and security of citizens; it aims to undermine

our democratic institutions and jeopardises our vital and strategic interests, infrastructures,
supplies and critical services. Preventing, impeding and defeating terrorism, whatever its
origin, is a priority aim of the Government.

Spain has suffered the cruelty and senselessness of ETA terrorism for more than fifty

years. The maturity of Spanish society – with the victims as an ethical reference – the unity
of the political parties, the action of the Law Enforcement Agencies and Intelligence Services,
the work of judges and prosecutors and international cooperation have succeeded in

combating the threat of the terrorist organisation.
The strength of the rule of law, the soundness

###### ‘Preventing, impeding and of its institutions and the effectiveness of the
 defeating terrorism, whatever actions implemented have defeated ETA, although
 its origin, is a priority aim of democracy will continue to act and will not

lower its guard until it succeeds in disbanding the

###### the Government’

terrorist group.

Spain, like other countries in our neighbourhood, is also the target of jihadist terrorism,

especially terrorist organisations like Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb. Based on fanaticism,
these organisations attempt to impose by force their sole, exclusionary vision of Islam, taking
advantage of characteristics of the new global society such as facility of movement and the
new information and communication technologies to recruit members, procure resources,
carry out attacks and multiply the impact of their actions.

There are elements which make our country the target of international terrorism: its

relative closeness to unstable regions like the Sahel, where failed States are conducive to
criminal actions and the spread of violent extremism; the possible radicalisation of both
first- and second-generation emigrants settled in Spain or in countries belonging to our
cultural environment; the insistence of Islamic fundamentalist groups on presenting Spain
as part of the imaginary of Islam; and our firm involvement in fighting terrorism inside and
outside national territory.

Above and beyond the efficiency shown by the police, judicial and intelligence response

in combating terrorism, especially that of ETA, it is necessary to carry on deepening a


-----

comprehensive approach that involves the different Authorities and society. Consensus
between the different democratic political groups and a solid international cooperation
structure are likewise essential.

The counterterrorism practiced by Spain for decades has allowed it to gain considerable

experience that is also valuable in addressing new terrorist threats. The effectiveness of
the Spanish model for managing terrorist threats gives our country prestige abroad and
makes it a reference in this field but, above all, it places it in an ideal position to provide
considerable added value to international collaboration in counterterrorism.

###### 3. Cyberthreats

Cyperspace, a new area of relations which has spurred the development of new

information and communication technologies, has blurred borders making possible an
unprecedented globalisation that provides new opportunities but entails serious risks and
threats.

Society’s dependence on cyberspace and its easy accessibility make interference

in this area increasingly common and cause for concern. Cyberspace is largely a means
for the materialisation of other risks and
threats. Cyberattacks, whether in the form of
cyberterrorism, cybercrimes/cyberoffences,

###### ‘Society’s dependence on

cyberespionage or hacktivism, have become a

###### cyberspace and its easy

powerful instrument for attacking individuals and
public and private institutions. Factors such as **_accessibility make interference_**
their low cost and minimal risks to the attacker **_in this space increasingly_**
and their easy use, effectiveness and accessibility **_common and cause for concern’_**
explain why the phenomenon is spreading.

These illegal attacks are perpetrated – and

increasingly frequently – by terrorist groups, organised crime networks, companies, States or
individuals. Cybersecurity can also be jeopardised by technical factors or natural phenomena.

These circumstances explain why guaranteeing the integrity, confidentiality and availability

of the systems which support the provision of widely used services and the management of
critical infrastructures is a priority objective.


-----

as well as activities related to illegal immigration and the economic importance of the
services sector, are factors which can be taken advantage of by criminal organisations
when attempting to establish their structures in Spain and penetrate the various levels of


The absence of harmonised cybersecurity legislation and the fact that the Internet

was designed to be an accessible, simple and useful channel of communication, without
considering its security aspects, are factors that increase the possibilities of cyberattacks
materialising.

Spain is exposed to cyberattacks, which are not only costly but also, and more important,

cause citizens to lose confidence in systems of critical importance to the normal functioning
of today’s society.

###### 4. Organised Crime

Organised crime is characterised by its transnational nature, opacity, flexibility, ability

to adapt and recover, and its mobility. It rocks the political and economic foundations of
States and at the same time encourages vicious circles of insecurity in that members of the
criminal networks can collaborate with corrupt governments, paramilitary organisations or
terrorist groups. Therefore organised crime generates and activates other risks and threats
– chiefly money laundering – which contribute to weakening the State, hindering economic
growth and undermining democracy.

Furthermore, irrespective of the repercussions activities like piracy and the trafficking

in drugs, arms and persons have on economic activities and the human rights violations
these criminal actions cause, there is evidence that the links between criminal and terrorist
organisations or groups are becoming closer all the time. This connection adds further
danger to the phenomenon.

In addition, better communications and increased cross-border flows of goods, persons

and services allow us to predict that organised crime will increase in volume, scope and

profits, chiefly by exploiting new markets in
regions experiencing fast economic growth.

###### ‘Links between criminal
 organisations and terrorist Spain is one of the European countries where

of the EU and the destination point for important
access routes from Africa and the Americas,

as well as activities related to illegal immigration and the economic importance of the
services sector, are factors which can be taken advantage of by criminal organisations
when attempting to establish their structures in Spain and penetrate the various levels of


-----

government administration and business circles. It is a serious, real and direct threat to our
interests and to National Security in the political, economic, social sphere and with respect
to the protection of the rule of law.

###### 5. Economic and Financial Instability

Economic and financial instability is currently one of the main risks and threats not

only because of the political and social unrest it causes but also because it fuels and
reinforces other existing risks. It is becoming increasingly clear that economic security is an
essential requisite and integral part of National Security owing to its repercussions on the
implementation of Government action and the well-being of citizens.

The factors which destabilise the economic and financial system are many and very

heterogeneous. Their origin lies in macroeconomic or market imbalances, illegal actions or
the functional deficiencies of supervisory bodies. In this respect the existence of tax havens
has a destabilising effect on the system in that it encourages money laundering activities.

Globalisation has furthermore speeded up events, especially in the economic and financial

sphere, owing to the high degree of interdependence, requiring States and international
organisations and bodies to respond rapidly to the changes that occur. Market volatility,
technological innovation, the development of communications and logistics, the complexity
and competitiveness of production systems
and sharp variations in the price of food,
commodities and energy require States to **_‘Globalisation has speeded up events,_**
be able to react immediately and forcefully **_especially in the economic and_**
in order to adapt their system to the new

situation without being badly affected,

###### and international organisations

thereby preventing scenarios as serious as
the economic or financial collapse of the **_and bodies to respond rapidly to the_**
public and private sector. **_changes that occur’_**

Economic risks have emerged with

particular significance in recent years
following the onset of this deep crisis which has lessened Spain’s economic resilience. As a
result Spain’s economy and social well-being have been affected.

Economic interdependence and the variety of economic agents involved therefore define


-----

risks which must necessarily be addressed from a flexible approach

###### 6. Energy vulnerability

Spain is still a vulnerable country with respect to energy. On the one hand, it depends

exclusively on other countries for its supply and, on the other, the low rate of gas and electricity
interconnections with the rest of Europe increases the threat of supply interruptions.

This vulnerability is heightened in the new geostrategic context characterised by the

rapid economic growth of large countries, leading to a considerable rise in energy demand.
There is growing competition for scant resources. The possibility of this competition being
conducted outside the market framework and giving rise to conflicts over the control of
energy resources is a risk and a threat to international security and to Spain. Energy is a key
factor in economic progress and the correct functioning of society.

Energy security depends on different factors: an adequate supply at affordable prices,

secure installations and transport networks, and environmental sustainability.

In the particular case of hydrocarbons and gas, the situation is more complex owing to the

geopolitical instability of most of the producing
areas. The progressive increase in the cost

###### ‘Spain’s energy security depends of obtaining and producing hydrocarbons is
 on all these factors and on the another significant factor. security of our infrastructures

The terrorist activities conducted in some

from the supply perspective. Furthermore,
the distribution of these energy resources
is vulnerable as they are transported by sea

across critical spots such as the Strait of Hormuz and the Suez Canal. Any blockage, whether
deliberate or accidental, has highly negative effects on the international market and can lead
to supply interruptions for the consumer countries.

Spain’s energy security depends on all these factors and on the security of our infrastructures

and transport networks vis-à-vis deliberate attacks or natural disasters.

biological substances and agents derives from their dual use. This poses a major challenge to
the Chemical Weapons Convention and its system of verification, for which the Organization


###### 7. Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction

The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (nuclear, chemical and biological) and

their delivery systems (such as ballistic and cruise missiles) poses a serious threat to peace and
international security.

Spain, like the other members of the international community, is exposed to the risks and

threats – of such far-reaching importance to maintaining world order and stability – posed
by the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their missile delivery systems.

As the EU recognised in 2003 in its Strategy against the Proliferation of Weapons of Mass

_Destruction, which Spain fully backs and shares, although the international treaty regimes_
and export control arrangements have slowed the spread of weapons of mass destruction
and their delivery systems, a number of States have sought or are seeking to develop these
weapons.

The destabilising repercussions of proliferation on international security are reinforced

by the fact that places where the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is developing
most rapidly are areas under huge tension; this increases the risk of these weapons actually
being used.

###### ‘The development of nuclear

###### rules on non-proliferation’

the development of nuclear programmes –
supposedly for peaceful purposes – can pose
a threat when the use of this technology entails avoiding compliance with the international
rules on non-proliferation. In this connection, as the IAEA has repeatedly stated, Iran’s
nuclear programme does not correspond to an exclusively civilian use.

A particular difficulty of the regimes for verifying and controlling exports of chemical and

biological substances and agents derives from their dual use. This poses a major challenge to
the Chemical Weapons Convention and its system of verification, for which the Organization


-----

for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) is responsible. With respect to biological
agents, the non-existence of a verification protocol to the Biological Weapons Convention,
coupled with the potential misuse of dual-use technology and scientific knowledge in this field,
make it necessary to define an alternative framework.

The risk of terrorist groups acquiring chemical or biological substances or radiological

or fissile materials and their delivery means adds a new dimension to this threat, with the
possibility of their being used against States’ vital structures and populations.

As is recognised in the document on _New Lines of Action by the European Union in_

_Combating the Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction and their Delivery Systems adopted_
by the EU General Affairs and External Relations Council in December 2008 and reflected
in its Conclusions, one of the greatest risks and threats to Europeans is that nuclear weapons,
chemical and biological agents and radiological material may be in the hands of certain States
of special concern, but also in those of terrorist groups and non-State agents.

The recent development of ballistic programmes of autonomous capacity in the

production of medium- and long-range missiles, as well as cruise missiles and unmanned
aircraft, are additional causes for concern.

###### 8. Irregular Migratory Flows

Although migratory flows are processes which have taken place throughout history, the

dynamics witnessed in recent decades and their volume have made them a phenomenon
with implications for security policy.

World population growth in the coming decade will be concentrated in developing

countries, particularly in Africa and Asia. If poverty, inequality, wars, environmental risks,
institutional weakness and authoritarian regimes persist in these countries, irregular
migratory flows from them can also be expected to continue or increase, as the absence of
life expectations, lack of personal security and lack of human rights are determining factors
that spur emigration.

The European Union continues to be an attractive destination and a host to people of very

varied origin. The phenomenon of international immigration involves the arrival, in both Spain
and Europe as a whole, of regular and irregular immigrants.


-----

In the case of Spain, the new migratory scene is characterised by fewer arrivals; this

certainly reduces risks in border control, but it does not completely exclude sources of
potential unrest within the country. The seriousness of the economic crisis and the worsening
of the living conditions of various population sectors may thus lead to mistaken attitudes of
rejection towards immigration in general.

But as occurs to a great extent in the rest of Europe, our country faces a host of

challenges stemming from the settlement of irregular migratory flows. Conditions of
particular concern may include:

a) Greater inadaptability and failure to identify

with Spanish society due to weakened social

###### ‘This new environment requires

cohesion.

###### educational and protective efforts

b) Greater social unrest due to worsening living

conditions and increased exclusion. **_from the Authorities, as well the_**

c) The emergence of urban ghettoes and their **_active promotion of immigration_**

effects on the coexistence, social cohesion **_as a positive-sum gain in the_**
and integration of immigrants

###### economic, social and cultural

d) Greater vulnerability of migrants as targets

###### spheres’

of forms of labour exploitation and the
action of organised criminal groups involved
in human trafficking and the drug trade.

Radical extremism is especially important because the economic vulnerability, exclusion

and subjection of certain sectors of immigrants to radical and intolerant creeds, religious or
otherwise, can be used by extremist and violent or terrorist organisations to achieve their
own ends.

The best expression of the plural and open nature of Spanish society is how well

immigrants have been received in our country. However, the overall positive trend
cannot minimise the risk of the emergence of minorities that foster a negative perception
of immigration. Conversely, the severity of the crisis may trigger frustration among
immigrants themselves who, owing to dashed labour expectations, lack of access to
services or feelings of social exclusion, may be tempted by the so-called ‘identity-based
isolationism’, which hinders their integration.


-----

###### 9. Espionage

Espionage has adapted to the new landscape of the globalised world and currently

makes use of the possibilities provided by information and communication technologies.
Aggressions by States, groups or individuals for the purpose of gaining information that gives
them strategic, political or economic advantages have been a constant feature in history and
continue to pose a major threat to security.

Economic espionage is of great importance in today’s competitive environment and consists

of the illegal procurement of information, industrial property or critical technology, and even
involves attempts to exert illegal influence on political decisions of an economic nature. Its

potential impact is increasing on account of its
ability to harm the economic system and affect

###### ‘Espionage has adapted to the citizens’ well-being.
 new landscape of the globalised

Spain, like the rest of the EU and NATO

###### world and makes use of the

members, faces hostile actions from other

###### possibilities provided by

States. These actions are always contrary to

###### information and communication national interests – regardless of whether
 technologies’ they originate from within or outside Spanish

territory – and are particularly aggressive in
situations of conflict or tension. Together with
traditional espionage methods, these activities

are increasingly based on sophisticated technological training programmes that can provide
access to huge amounts of information and, in a worst-case scenario, to sensitive data.

###### 10. Emergencies and Disasters

Mankind has always been struck by natural disasters. But they are developing new

features and dimensions owing to the interdependence that characterises risks and threats
in today’s world.

Added to the traditional loss of lives and property is thus damage such as the destruction

of infrastructures and means of production, contamination and even the disruption of
communications, markets and supply flows.

In addition to risks and threats originating from natural phenomena, a growing number


-----

of disasters are caused by human activity or result from a combination of both types of
emergency, such as the case of the tsunami which struck Japan in 2011 and the resulting
nuclear accident that occurred immediately afterwards at the Fukushima plant. In this context
it is necessary to consider the impact of climate change and the extreme environmental
phenomena associated with it.

Spain has had to deal with natural disasters such as earthquakes (Lorca, 2011), volcanic

eruptions (El Hierro, 2011) and recurring floods, and the impact of climate change owing
to the acceleration of global warming could destabilise weather conditions, increase major
fires or trigger other environmental disasters.

The recurring and devastating fires that

ravage our natural heritage are a serious
problem for Spain. They can cause major

###### ‘The recurring and devastating

damage not only to the environment but to

###### fires that ravage our natural

the well-being, economy and security of our
citizens in general. **_heritage are a serious problem for_**

###### Spain’

The unsustainable use of water resources,

desertification, the large-scale spread of certain
diseases and pandemics – spurred by mass
population displacements – and illegal trafficking in animals and animal derivatives have
become significant risks to Spain. In addition to known diseases, new ones have emerged such
as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and others like tuberculosis, which we believed to
have been eradicated, have reappeared. Diseases like foot-and-mouth disease and swine fever
can also harm a country’s economy.

###### 11. Vulnerability of Maritime Space

The seas and oceans account for somewhat more than two-thirds of the planet. It is

an easily accessible space and is generally less regulated and controlled than air or ground
space. These characteristics no doubt make maritime space an environment where security
risks and threats can spread relatively easily and quickly. The realisation of this fact in recent
years has led the international community to make a major legislative, technological and
operational effort to gain greater control over the sea.

Added to the accessibility and lower degree of regulation of maritime space is the fact


-----

that human activity at sea is increasing. The facilities provided by shipping routes, coupled
with progress in maritime transport, have significantly increased trade. What is more, much
energy transportation is via this route and nowadays the search for energy resources is
largely centred on sea beds. There is no doubt that maritime space continues to hold a high
strategic value today.

In addition to the increase in lawful activities at sea, unlawful or criminal activities that take

advantage of the particular characteristics of this environment are also on the rise. Actions

related to drug trafficking, illegal immigration and
piracy have increased. A particular concern is that

###### ‘In addition to the increase national or transnational terrorist groups may take in lawful activities at sea, advantage of the freedom of movement provided unlawful or criminal activities by the sea to commit their criminal acts. that take advantage of the

In Spain’s case the sea is of particular strategic

###### particular characteristics of the

value. Nearly ninety percent of our imports and

###### environment are also on the slightly more than sixty percent of exports are rise’ currently shipped by sea. Maritime security is also

essential to guaranteeing energy supplies, as we

receive a large proportion of our gas and oil resources by sea. It is essential to preserve
freedom of navigation and ensure the constant functioning of infrastructures on land owing
to their direct repercussions on economic and energy security.

Furthermore, Spain has sovereign rights or exercises jurisdiction over a vast maritime

area in which it holds important responsibilities related to the exploration and sustainable
exploitation of all kinds of resources, the preservation of the marine and coastal environment
and the preservation of its underwater archaeological heritage.

Spain must guarantee the protection of human life at sea and the security of navigation in

a marine area of one and a half million square kilometres – the equivalent to three times its
territory. The area for which we are responsible includes some of the major world shipping
routes and this factor increases the likelihood of accidents. When these accidents involve
oil tankers and vessels carrying chemical, harmful and dangerous substances, they can have
serious consequences for the ecosystem and even affect the economy of a whole region.


-----

###### 12. Vulnerability of Critical Infrastructures and Essential Services

Modern societies are increasingly dependent on the complex system of essential services

which underpin and make possible the normal functioning of production and management
sectors and civic life in general. They guarantee not only citizens’ security, social and economic
well-being and health and the maintenance
of basic social functions but also the effective
functioning of the State institutions and Public **_‘Modern societies are_**
Authorities. **_increasingly dependent on the_**

###### complex system of essential

Services are mostly provided by the so-called

###### services which underpin and

critical infrastructures – installations, networks,

###### make possible the normal

physical and information technology systems and
equipment whose functioning is indispensable **_functioning of production and_**
and for which there are no alternative solutions-. **_management sectors and civic_**

###### life in general’

The disturbance or destruction of any of these

assets may have a direct impact on National
Security and affect, for example, financial stability,
public health or a combination of these security dimensions.

The considerable complexity of the systems which underpin public services and the

interrelations between these systems explain why the failure of a critical infrastructure
can trigger a cascade of negative effects by causing a chain of failures in other systems
or installations, with harmful consequences on basic services for the population and the
functioning of the State.

The risks and threats hovering over Spain’s critical infrastructures are many. They can be

due to natural causes or to unexpected human errors or technological failures. However,
those which are caused deliberately, either through physical aggression or a cyberattack, are
the most dangerous as their motive and aims are to cause serious damage to Spain and its
citizens.

###### The fourth chapter of the National Security Strategy establishes twelve priority areas of action. It defines the objective and several strategic lines of action for each of them. These lines of action will provide a framework for the specific actions required to preserve National Security.

secure environment with respect to the many dimensions encompassed by National
Security contributes decisively to well-being, progress and prosperity: it encourages

### A

investment, increases flows of human capital, boosts tourism, is beneficial to quality of life and,
above all, improves how our country is perceived both by Spaniards and by the international
community. National Security enables us to progress together and be recognised and valued
externally.


Analysis of global risks, threats and trends and the existing response capabilities is the

basis of the twelve areas of action identified in this chapter. The objective to be achieved
in each of these areas is defined and several strategic lines of action are established as
the framework for effective and comprehensive responses to the existing challenges to
National Security. The current economic environment calls for specific responses based on
optimising available resources and rationalising existing structures.

PROTECTION OF CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURES
society.


-----

###### 1. NATIONAL DEFENCE


**1.** Provide military capabilities which make possible the performance of the assigned missions and a

credible level of deterrence. In any event, National Defence will retain the necessary capabilities for
reacting to and neutralising any military risk or threat.


**2.** Maintain the State’s commitment to the system of collective security on the basis of membership of

international organisations and through active participation in overseas operations together with the
defence of national interests. Actions will be carried out which contribute to the external action of the
State and to Spain’s international position.


**3. Continue the Armed Forces’ effort to adapt to new realities and challenges through a process of**

constant change, enabling resources to be used efficiently and with particular emphasis on people.


**4.** Adjust the effort to adapt to the current situation of economic crisis. Capabilities will be shared with

our allies in international security organisations without affecting the performance of missions assigned.


**5. Foster defence awareness and culture as the bases for Spanish society’s support for National Defence,**

paying special attention to young people.


**6.** Strengthen the fabric of Spain’s Defence industry through actions aimed at fostering, projecting and

collaborating with the national capabilities that are deemed necessary, while safeguarding its own ope­
rational needs. Links will be strengthened between the actors that make up the optimal architecture
in this area (Industry, University and Defence).


-----

###### 2. COMBATING TERRORISM


Following a structure similar to that adopted by the EU Counter-Terrorism Strategy, the different strategic
lines of action will be based on the four pillars of prevention, protection, pursuit and response.

**1.** Prevention: acting against terrorism at its source. Action will be taken at source within the country in


order to prevent the recruitment of new terrorists through the processes of radicalisation, ensuring
the coordinated action of all the Authorities for this purpose. Externally, Spain will take part in develo­
ping a policy that is agreed and coordinated with the democratic countries – preferably though com­
mon action within the EU – and will cooperate in combating radicalisation at source. In the domain
of cyberspace, efforts will be made to ensure that the Internet is not used by terrorism as a means of
radicalisation, propagation and achievement of its aims.


**2.** Protection: reducing our vulnerability. In this area efforts will be aimed at lessening opportunities for

committing attacks by improving and increasing our national capabilities both within our own country
(by bolstering the protection of sensitive targets and improving border control), externally (where
Spain’s interests are deployed) and in virtual space (by strengthening national information networks
and systems).


**3.** Pursuit: addressing terrorist activity. Capabilities for investigating and gathering intelligence on terrorists

and their actions will be promoted and improved by adapting the necessary national coordination,
direction and supervision instruments in order to ensure the greatest possible effectiveness of the
institutions and public powers. Measures will be adopted to prevent the planning of acts of terrorism,
their financing and access to the materials needed to commit attacks.


**4.** Response: restoring normality. If the terrorist threat were to materialise, the necessary measures and

plans will be adopted to ensure the synergy and coordination of all the bodies with responsibilities in
this area. In particular, its consequences will be minimised, immediate and permanent support will be
given to the victims of terrorist attacks, the speedy recovery of the essential activity sectors will be
guaranteed and the experience needed for future actions will be gained.


-----

###### 3. CYBERSECURITY


**1. Bolster the ability to prevent, detect, investigate and respond to cyberattacks with the underpinning of**

an operational and effective legal framework. Procedures will be improved and the necessary resou­
rces will be strengthened with special emphasis on Public Authorities, critical infrastructures, military
and defence capabilities and all systems of national interest.


**2. Guarantee the security of information systems and communications and infrastructure networks**

common to all the Public Authorities. The implementation of the National Security Scheme provided
for in Law 11/2007 will be completed by reinforcing detection capabilities and improving the defence
of classified systems. The security of information systems and communications networks supporting
critical infrastructures will be enhanced. Regulations on the protection of critical infrastructures will be
promoted along with the development of the capabilities needed to protect essential services.


**3. Improve the security and resilience of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in the**

private sector by using the capabilities of public powers. Actions designed to step up public-private
collaboration and the security and robustness of the ICT networks, products and services used by the
industrial sector will be promoted and led.


**4. Promote cybersecurity training for professionals and boost Spanish industry through an R&D&I Plan.**

**5. Implement a sound cybersecurity culture. Citizens’, professionals’ and companies’ awareness will be**


raised on the importance of information security and the responsible use of new technologies and
the services of the knowledge society.


**6. Step up international collaboration. Efforts will be promoted to achieve an international cyberspace**

in which the initiatives of all the countries that pursue a secure and reliable environment are aligned.
National interests will be safeguarded at all times.


-----

###### 4. COMBATING ORGANISED CRIME


As organised crime is closely linked to the transnationality of these groups and their activities and profits,
the strategic lines of action must be based on international collaboration and cooperation in both the
public – police, judicial and intelligence – and the private sphere.

**1. Sensitise and raise society’s awareness to the fact that combating this phenomenon is a global effort**


that goes beyond our borders and may require the deployment of troops in third countries. This is es­
pecially necessary in the case of crimes involving different types of trafficking (drugs, weapons, people,
vehicles, etc.). In this connection it is necessary to strengthen and increase collaboration links with
countries and geographical areas of priority interest to Spain in order to create a hostile environment
that hinders the establishment of these organisations in our country. Legislation must be harmonised
with countries of key importance to Spain on seizing the assets of the criminal organisations based in
them.


**2. Strengthen and improve the resources, mechanisms and procedures of police investigation in relation**

to influence peddling in institutions and all forms of corruption.


**3. Improve police efficiency through regulatory reforms that foster and develop centralised direction and**

coordination in combating organised crime and by stepping up collaboration with judicial bodies and the
department of prosecution.


**4. Improve collaboration between strategic intelligence centres and agencies, especially by fostering the**

exchange of information.


**5. Strengthen and improve investigation of money laundering in order to minimise its impact on the**

economic and financial sphere


**6. Comprehensive treatment of the problem of organised crime by involving public and private national**

actors and, in particular, the university sector in combating this phenomenon.


-----

###### 5. ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL SECURITY


**1. Strengthen a model of sustainable economic growth that minimises both public and private imba­**

lances; boosts productivity, the business fabric, innovation and competitiveness; reinforces high valueadded sectors; creates quality jobs; maintains healthy public accounts and price stability throughout the
economic cycle; and guarantees social cohesion.


**2. Establish a social and employment framework that contributes to the effective management of labour**

relations – based on social dialogue with a view to adopting agreed measures that help reduce levels
of unrest and foster social peace – and facilitates job stability, job creation and labour-market efficiency.


**3. Promote an open international economy with a stable system of free trade and investment in the**

framework of the international forums where Spain is present. International agreements on making
the financial system more transparent will be fostered. Legal certainty will be promoted in the areas
in which Spanish companies active overseas invest.


**4. Reinforce the current regulatory and supervisory mechanisms to ensure their work is effective and to**

avert systemic crises. Establish new regulatory and supervisory mechanisms that guarantee effective
global economic and financial governance such as those proposed by the G20, a forum in which Spain
takes part with permanent guest status.


**5. Contribute to effective economic and financial governance of the EU in order to ensure the sustai­**

nability and proper functioning of EMU and the strength of the euro. Active cooperation in building
European economic governance with common instruments and coordinated economic policies that
will likewise include studying surveillance measures for tax havens.


**6. Foster suitable coordination mechanisms that allow the development of economic security and its**

support tools – such as the Economic Intelligence System.


**7. Strategic effort based on on-going action and communication to enhance Spain’s reputation and**

image, defend our interests at economic forums and institutions and support the internationalisation
of Spanish enterprises and entrepreneurs in order to contribute to building a solid and positive ‘Spain
brand’ from both the public and the private sector.


**8. Define a procedure for close cooperation between the private organisations and Public Authorities**

responsible for the security of financial infrastructures and services.


-----

###### 6. ENERGY SECURITY


In supply:
**1.** Energy mix. Broaden energy sources beyond fossil fuels and nuclear energy. Support for renewable
energies that allow regular production at prices which boost the competitiveness of our companies.
Encourage the use of autochthonous energy sources.

**2.** Promote a common European energy policy that fosters interconnections between Member States,
especially between Spanish territory and the rest of Europe. A fully integrated European electricity
and natural gas market is a guarantee of energy supply, security and quality. Connectivity reduces
physical vulnerability, allows flexibility in supply interruptions and fosters intermodal competition
between gas and electricity.

**3.** Update oil reserve management. Promote the research and exploitation of hydrocarbon deposits
and design feasibility plans for extracting these resources within the territory.

In distribution:


**4.** Strengthen the operational flexibility of the national system of energy transport networks. Revise
the plans for channelling and prioritising demand in the event of interruption or shortage of supply,
in coordination with the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the EU.

**5.** Reinforce control of communications, both maritime and terrestrial.


**6.** Strengthen the different forms of storage by increasing the installed capacity of hydraulic pumping
systems and gas storage.

**7.** Improve the reliability of gas supply networks, the oil transport and distribution system and the elec­
tricity grid.

**8.** Develop public-private collaboration in order to guarantee supply in the event that critical infrastruc­
tures are affected.

In consumption:
**9.** Foster energy saving and improve energy efficiency.
**10. Promote energy sustainability through actions which take into account the fiscal and environmental**

aspects and the efficient use of the available resources.


**11. Encourage a harmonised, transparent and objective regulatory framework that boosts legal certainty**

and the competitiveness of companies.


-----

###### 7. NON-PROLIFERATION OF WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION


**1. Effective multilateralism and active cooperation in combating the proliferation of weapons of mass des­**

truction. Close cooperation with EU Member States and NATO allies – as well as with significant part­
ner countries – is essential to the worldwide success of the fight against proliferation and, in particular,
to the prevention, deterrence, detention and, where possible, elimination of proliferation programmes
of particular global concern, as well as to preventing terrorist groups and other non-State agents from
gaining access to radioactive materials and sources. Preventive surveillance measures will be adopted in
relation to Internet use.


**2. Strengthen the non-proliferation system by fully enforcing the related international treaties and instru­**

ments, including the Resolutions of the UN Security Council. Resolution 1540 of 2004, sponsored by
Spain, is particularly important in this connection.


**3. Develop and update national plans for the prevention of proliferation and mitigation of nuclear, che­**

mical and biological risks, as well as the implementation of a national biosecurity plan.


**4. Reinforce policies and practices for controlling the exportation of dual-use products and technologies**

related to weapons of mass destruction, in coordination with partners of export control regimes.
The location, control and interception of illegal trafficking in those products and technologies must
be stepped up.


**5. Strengthen measures to combat intangible transfers of knowledge, technology, goods and equipment.**

Preventive and punitive measures will be adopted against the illegal financing of proliferation. National
legal measures will be reinforced, in coordination with other States, to prevent proliferation, also fos­
tering regional cooperation.


**6. Further the improvement of national and international capabilities for preventing the threat of possible**

terrorist attacks with nuclear, radioactive or both types of materials in cooperation with our partners and,
especially, in the framework of the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism _(GICNT), launched jointly by_
the presidents of the United States and Russia in 2006 and for which Spain was chosen in 2010 to be the
first coordinator of the Implementation and Assessment Group.


**7. Support for international efforts to limit the proliferation of long- and short-range missiles, which can**

be used to deliver weapons of mass destruction. In this connection Spain supports the universalisa­
tion of the HCOC (Hague Code of Conduct against Ballistic Missile Proliferation). It will furthermore
back the development of an autonomous missile defence capability in the framework of NATO and
its Missile Defence Programme and the harmonisation of the principle of minimum deterrence with
international disarmament commitments.


-----

###### 8. MANAGEMENT OF MIGRATORY FLOWS


**1. Effective management of migratory flows.**

**2. Surveillance and control of access routes to Spain’s external borders in the framework of the EU**


_System of Integrated Border Management._


**3. Cooperation with countries of origin and transit for migratory flows in order to facilitate their deve­**

lopment, foster means of legal immigration and prevent irregular immigration at source.


**4. Irrespective of legal status, the following strategic lines of action will be followed:**

**4.1** Defence of legality and preservation of citizen security, in order to facilitate the fight against
organised crime and irregular immigration and human trafficking networks, and to prevent
certain groups from using or recruiting immigrants for illegal activities.


**4.2.** Combat discrimination and guarantee the principle of equality, with particular attention to the
most vulnerable groups, especially unaccompanied minors, families and women.

**4.3.** Promote social integration with areas of coexistence and support for the most vulnerable im­
migrants. The responsibility of communities of immigrants will be encouraged in a framework
of shared political and social interests.


**5. Close collaboration between Public Authorities and, if necessary, with NGOs and the private sector,**

with the aim of preventing the risks associated with irregular immigration.


-----

###### 9. COUNTERINTELLIGENCE


**1. Draft updated rules to regulate the protection of classified information..**

**2. Promote and reinforce the capabilities of national intelligence bodies in order to guarantee the avai­**


lability of the human and technical resources needed to counter this threat effectively.


**3. Continuous awareness-raising at all levels of staff – of both Public Authorities and companies and**

organisations – who handle classified information or may be targets of aggression owing to their im­
portance.


**4. Encourage protection and awareness-raising of Spanish citizens who are active outside national terri­**

tory and may therefore be more vulnerable to hostile actions of other States, groups or individuals.


**5. Increase international cooperation in counterintelligence, both bilaterally and in the multinational se­**

curity and defence organisations to which Spain belongs, in order to provide a comprehensive respon­
se in defence of national interests.


-----

###### 10. PROTECTION FROM EMERGENCIES AND DISASTERS


**1. Adopt an approach that integrates and strengthens the actions of the Central Government, Auto­**

nomous Regions and Local Authorities – particularly in the detection, planning and development of
actions vis-à-vis emergencies and disasters – in order to ensure preventive action, an appropriate
response and an efficient use of the limited resources available. These actions will be based on the
principles of caution and prevention, collaboration and cooperation, coordination, inter-territorial so­
lidarity, subsidiarity, efficiency, participation and equality.


**2. Establish a frame of reference in this field that is conducive to promoting and coordinating efforts,**

establishes priorities and optimises resources in order to achieve common objectives.


**3. Update and improve the legal framework for protection from emergencies and disasters, with empha­**

sis on the preventive approach in order to avert or mitigate the possible adverse impact of these
situations.


**4. Establish protocols for coordinated action for the different parties involved.**

**5. Establish a national warning network for natural (including seismic), environmental, epidemiological**


and technological risks in order to improve the coordination of the different early warning organi­
sations under a multi-risk approach. The ultimate aim is to create an intelligent network system for
planning that allows the different risks to be identified, assessed, prevented and mitigated.


**6. Maintain directories of resources for effectively managing the healthcare response in emergency and**

disaster situations.


**7. Promote a culture of prevention among citizens, including self-protection knowledge and attitudes,**

in order to strengthen resilience to sudden and unexpected emergencies. Prevention education pro­
grammes for schools will also be promoted.


**8. Contribute to greater European and international cooperation. Spain will maintain and increase its**

involvement in the different European plans and mechanisms for preparing for and responding to
emergencies and disasters.


**9. Adopt plans for preparing for and responding to pandemics under the principle of coordination bet­**

ween the Central Government and Regional Authorities and with international bodies such as the
World Health Organization and the EU’s European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.


**10. Adopt management and communication protocols for food crisis situations in coordination with the**

EU and other major international bodies.


-----

###### 11. MARITIME SECURITY


**1. Adopt a comprehensive approach that fosters the coordinated and cooperative action of a large**

number of departments, bodies and agencies of the Public Authorities in solving problems that affect
maritime security.


**2. Optimisation and effective use of the limited resources available. The pursuit of synergies and rationa­**

lisation of assets will be promoted. The prevention and response capabilities of the Public Authorities
will be integrated.


**3. Foster international cooperation. The process of implementing the regulations of the EU and the In­**

ternational Maritime Organization (IMO) will be continued as a framework for Spain’s actions. Bilateral
agreements will be maintained and promoted with other countries for exchanging information and
carrying out joint activities.


**4. Foster collaboration with the private sector. The involvement of the private sector is essential in the**

field of maritime security and for this purpose the collaboration of shipping companies, ship owners,
shipyards, rating companies and others will be sought in order to achieve the objectives established in
the maritime security policy.


-----

###### 12. PROTECTION OF CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURES


-----

**6.** International cooperation. Compliance with the European Programme for Critical Infrastructure Protec­

_tion (EPCIP) and Council Directive 2008/114/EC on the Identification and Designation of European Critical_
_Infrastructures and the Assessment of the Need to Improve their Protection will be encouraged. Both_
instruments are considered the best means of enlisting the cooperation of European countries and
protecting our national interests. Similarly, the existence of international channels for information, early
warning and response will be promoted, together with active participation in international forums.

**7.** Safeguard the security of critical infrastructures in accordance with the National Plan for the Protection

_of Critical Infrastructures (Plan Nacional de Protección de Infrastructuras Críticas, PNPIC). These installa­_
tions will be equipped with independent standby systems using other technologies and operators as
the functioning of essential services depends on them.

###### 1. Structure of the National Security

The Prime Minister has the role of directing, leading and giving impetus to the National

Security Policy, which involves all the Public Authorities. Tools are required to facilitate
their coordination and effectively organise modular, flexible responses tailored to the risks
and threats we face. Only by acting decisively and with a comprehensive vision of all the
implications of the problems which compromise National Security is it possible to define
properly the strategic security environment in Spain.

In performing the function of directing, leading and giving impetus to the National

Security Policy, the Prime Minister will rely on: A) the National Security Council; and B) the
Specialised Committees.

**A. National Security Council**

The National Security Council will be a collegial Government body. It will meet

periodically at the proposal of the Prime Minister, who will chair it except when HM
the King attends its meetings. It will be made up of the Deputy Prime Minister, other
members of the Government, Secretaries of State and the Director of the Prime
Minister’s Office. In order to ensure the proper exercise of its functions, if the Prime
Minister so decides, only members whose responsibilities are most directly related to
the items on the agenda may be convened. In any event, the incumbents of the rest
of the ministerial departments as well as other authorities, senior public officials and
experts may also be convened to attend when the Council needs to discuss issues with
National Security repercussions related to their areas of responsibility or knowledge.

Under the direction of the Prime Minister, its main functions will be:

- to assist the Prime Minister in directing the National Security Policy;

- to promote and give impetus to the revision of the National Security Strategy;

- to promote and give impetus to the drafting of any second-level Strategies that are
deemed necessary and, if appropriate, proceed to their approval;

- to verify degree of compliance with the National Security Strategy;


-----

- to approve the Annual Security Report before it is submitted to Parliament;

- to direct and coordinate crisis management;

- to establish the necessary guidelines for planning and coordinating the National Security
Policy;

- to oversee the proper functioning of the National Security System;

- to perform other tasks attributed to it by law or assigned to it by the Prime Minister.

**B. Specialised Committees**

The Specialised Committees, established at the initiative of the National Security Council,

will be support bodies of the Council in the areas of action of the National Security Strategy.
Their creation, composition and functions will be specified in their regulations. They will be
established in areas that specially require the coordination of several Government bodies
owing to their singular and cross-cutting nature and when so required by situations relating
to crisis management.


-----

-----

###### 2. Monitoring and Control of the National Security Strategy

It is the responsibility of the National Security Council to monitor and verify compliance

with the National Security Strategy.

The National Security Strategy will be revised periodically.

The Government will submit the Annual Report on National Security to Parliament and

will debate on the guidelines of the National Security Policy.

###### 3. Progressive Reorganisation of the National Security System

A progressive reorganisation of the State structures and bodies responsible for the

direction, coordination and management of National Security is necessary in order to adapt
them to the comprehensive vision of security enshrined in the National Security Strategy
and to lend coherence to State action through the involvement of all the Public Authorities
responsible.

This development must be based on the State structures and bodies which perform

security-related functions. It must also reflect the structure of the State made up of
autonomous regions, and pursue cohesion in actions.

National crisis-management instruments will be reviewed in order to facilitate decision

making within the framework of the National Security System. In particular, the crisismanagement system will follow the same comprehensive approach that inspires this
Strategy; will have clear guidelines for action allowing the different areas involved to
be coordinated; will be standardised and interoperable with the instruments provided
for in international treaties to which Spain is party; and will carry out supervision and
constant and updated management of crisis-anticipation and crisis-response capabilities
and measures

The gradual reform of the National Security System and perfecting of the crisis
management instruments will require the applicable regulations to be adapted through
an Organic Law. Within six months of its establishment, the National Security Council will
prepare a draft bill for an Organic Law on National Security to be submitted to the Council
of Ministers.
