#### Preface

The Republic of Korea (ROK) Ministry of National Defense (MND) has
decided to release its Defense White Paper every other year in May, instead
of publishing it annually in the last quarter. It was believed that it would be
more appropriate to adjust the timing and frequency to enhance efficiency in
our operation in a period where there has not been any significant shift in
defense policy and also by considering the global trend in defense white paper
publications.

ROK MND has decided to publish a“2001 Defense Data &Statistics”in order
to maintain an element of continuity in the release of the defense-related
materials and at the same time, satisfy the public's“right to know”, when the
publication date of white paper is adjusted from this December to next May.

The“2001 Defense Data &Statistics”provides a brief overview of major ROK
military policies undertaken throughout the past year and offers reader-friendly
data and statistics in diagrammed format. It can also be readily accessed
on-line through the MND homepage at their disposal.

MND is exerting best efforts to fulfill its role and mission of being military
of the people that stands by the people by proactively responding to
transitional security environment and efficiently preparing for the future. We
would very much appreciate your continued support and encouragement.

# I. Security Environment

         - The world faces uncertainties with the emergence of
terrorist threats and the transition in world security order
resulting from US-led war against terrorism.

         - Elements of cooperation and conflict coexist in the
Northeast Asian region as neighboring powers become keen
on expanding their regional influence and prioritizing their
respective national interests.

         - Despite the increased inter-Korean cooperation and
exchange, the possibility of an escalation in military tension
remains high.

### 1. Global and Northeast Asian Environment

#### 1-1 Global Environment

    - The global security environment is becoming increasingly unpredictable
as a consequence of growing transnational threats, as evidenced by the
ongoing war against terrorism.

       - In addition to conventional military threats, other forms of
transnational and non-military threats, such as international
terrorism, environmental destruction, drug trafficking, organized
crime, and piracy are growing.

       - The September 11th terrorist attacks epitomize the kind of
international terrorism that targets indiscriminately and make no
distinction as to time, space, means. This kind of terrorism have
surfaced as a formidable new source of threat.

       - The formation of a new paradigm in international relations in the
wake of the US-led war against terrorism is filled with
uncertainties and instability.

    - Many countries are undertaking accelerated efforts to improve their
military technology and secure state-of-the-art weaponry to better
prepare for future warfare.


-----

#### 1-2 Northeasian Environment st A

    - In spite of the increasing cooperative partnerships among
countries in the region, a wide array of threats continue to fuel
instability in Northeast Asian region.

       - Russia and China are opposed to US efforts to build a
Missile Defense (MD) system, while China and Japan are
competing for greater regional influence.

       - Northeast Asia is a region with unresolved issues, such as
the Korean peninsula, the Taiwan Strait, territorial disputes
of various islands and maritime jurisdiction. These are the
factors that can have impact on regional stability.

    - The four neighbouring powers are seeking to expand their
regional influence and modernize their military forces.

       - The US declared its intention to readjust its security and
military relations with other countries in accordance with the
latter's level of cooperation to the anti-terror coalition. It is
also sustaining its balancing role by maintaining superior
military power while simultaneously building the most
cutting-edge military to prepare for future threats.

       - Japan is seeking to become a?normal state?through its
military assistance to war against terrorism, and is searching
for a role that is commensurate with its national power.
Modernizing its defense capabilities is also a high priority.

       - While restoring its cooperation with the US, China is seeking
to channel its economic might into expanded international
influence and is working to restructure its military toward a
high-tech naval and air power capability.

       - Russia is focusing on political and economic stability. In
addition, Russia is looking to regain its status as a great
power, by undertaking military reform and creating a mobile
force.

### 2. Analysis on North Korea

#### 2-1 Situation

    - North Korea is stressing its?military-first?policy and refurbishing its
internal cohesion. Chairman Kim Jong-il's visits to military bases have
increased in frequency, and North Korea is urging its people to arm
themselves with a?revolutionary military spirit?. North Korea is also
strengthening internal control to prevent military and popular agitation.

    - Additionally, North Korea is reinforcing its diplomatic efforts to
guarantee regime survival and gain outside economic assistance.

       - In 2001, North Korea continued to undertake active diplomacy and
normalize relations with 13 countries, including Germany and
Canada, raising the number of countries with which it has
established official diplomatic ties to 151.

       - North Korea has made persistent efforts to secure firm support
from China and Russia by holding summit meetings. .

       - Although North Korea continues to condemn the Bush
administration's North Korea policy, it has indicated a willingness
to engage in dialogue.

    - Since the June 2000 Summit, North Korea continues to delay in
bringing about progress in military affairs, despite expanded exchange
and cooperation between the two Koreas.

       - Meanwhile, it is posed to adopt a perfunctory conciliatory strategy
and continue to engage selectively in dialogue, while remaining
reluctant on holding a military conference and linking the
Seoul-Shineju railway.

    - North Korea continues its military build-up.

       - It is increasing its stock of strategic weapons and conventional
forces. In particular, it is producing long-range missiles and
submersibles, producing and deploying Chonma tanks, and seeking
to introduce major conventional forces, including armored
personnel carriers, combat vessels, and fighter aircraft.

       - It is also maintaining its military readiness by conducting ground,
sea and air exercises and periodic infiltration exercises. North
Korea is also constructing new bases along the attack corridors.

    - In short, military and non-military threats posed by North Korea will
remain as long as North Korea continues its "military-first" policy and
its goal to reunite the Korean peninsula under the Kim Jong-il regime.


-----

#### 2-2 Military Threat

    - Major threats posed by North Korea include its conventional force
where North Koreans maintain numerical advantage over us, its long
range artillery and mid and long range missiles that can strike both
front and rear areas, and its asymmetric force including chemical and
biological weapons such as Anthrax of which North Korea is believed
to hold a stockpile of 2,500 to 5,000 tons. .

#### 2-3 Military Budget

    - North Korea has allocated $1.42 billion, 14.5% of its national budget
for the 2001 defense outlay, which is a 4.4% increase compared to
2000.

    - However, considering its past military budget, force improvement
initiatives, and military size, North Korea's actual military spending is
expected to exceed 30% of the entire budget.

    - North Korea's defense expenditures are also financed by operating the
defense industry known as the second economy, whereby arms
exports, independently developed weapons, and business set up within
the military bring in foreign currency.

    - Therefore, the actual size of military investment is probably greater
than that made public. The maintenance costs, labor, rent and utilities
are either free or inexpensive.

    - Compared with the South, North Korea can achieve a greater deal of
force improvement by investing the same amount of money.

# II. Defense Policy and Posture


-----

### 1. 「New Defense for the 21st Century」

#### 1-1 Rationale and Concept of a「New Defense for the 21st Century 」

    - In an age characterized with rapid changes in the security environment
and forms of warfare, it would not be possible to adapt to the
transitional   changes in the security environment without innovative
efforts to   transform existing?frameworks of thought and practices
of the past.?   Moreover, uncertainty and instability can increase if
such changes are   not managed properly.

    - Accordingly, the Korean military has recognized the need to reorient
its   defense tasks to?respond to changes,?based on perceived shifts
in the   defense and security environment with self-initiating,
creative, and   responsible mindset.

    - Consequently,"New Defense for the 21st Century"is designed to
respond   proactively to the changing security environment,
through"innovative   thinking."A conceptual diagram is shown below:


-----

#### 1-2 Four Major Themes

    - Adherence to basics : This implies fostering armed forces that can
respond to any type of threat to fulfill its role and mission.

       - The basic role and mission of the military must remain intact
regardless of how inter-Korean relations and security environment
unfold. The military must be ready to defend against threats from
all directions, both military and non-military.

       - Intangible force capabilities will also be maximized by harmonizing
morale, discipline and unity to enhance efficiency and
effectiveness by establishing a working environment that embraces
creativity.

    - Management of change : This implies shaping a rapidly changing
security environment favorable to our national interests.

       - Managing the stability of the ROK-US alliance and exploring
future post-unification security order.

       - Dismantling the peninsula's Cold War structure by taking the
initiative in confidence building measures and arms control, and
military support of the inter-Korean exchange and cooperation
projects.

       - Improving military cooperation with neighboring countries, which
will contribute to progress and stability on the Korean peninsula.

    - Preparation for the future : This implies starting to build a military
prepared for uncertain security environment.

       - Knowledge and creativity determine the outcome of war in the
Information Age. The US and other developed nations are making
active efforts to prepare for future warfare.

       - Efforts to prepare efficiently against future threats, thereby
ensuring the nations prosperity by constructing an"Advanced
Information and Technology Force of the 21st Century."

    - Dedication to its people : This implies winning the confidence and
support of the ROK Populace.

       - Popular consensus and support are essential for the military in
democratic states.

       - Efforts must be made to achieve a 'defense with the people' by
winning its trust and understanding


-----

### 2. Omni-directional Defense Posture

#### 2-1 Readiness Posture of the ROK Armed Forces

    - In a time of security transition, our military is maintaining an omnidirectional readiness against not only military threats but also
non-military provocations, such as territorial waters intrusion by North
Korean vessels, the emergence of international terrorism.

    - To prepare against a full-scale North Korean attack, ROK and US
military forces operate combined surveillance assets to monitor North
Korean activities 24 hours a day. The ROK forces are also developing
its own surveillance capability through information improvement
projects.

       - To develop a ROK-US combined crisis management system, ROK
and the US are mastering the combined crisis management and
procedures. Crisis Action Plan and MATRIX have also been
improved.

       - To complete readiness alert for the early phase of war, our
military is reinforcing our forces in the front areas, and seeking
measures to deal with North Korea's long-range artillery aimed at
the metropolitan area.

       - Command structure for joint air defense for the metropolitan area
has been integrated. New air defense assets, such as Chonma and
Biho, have been developed.

       - A joint operation system, led by the ROK Joint Chiefs of Staff,
has been improved, reinforcing wartime operation to a greater
degree. Our military is also improving military readiness through
additional construction in relation to Seoul-Shineju railway
connection project.

    - To prepare against the enemy's infiltration and local provocations, we
are monitoring their infiltration assets and activities. We are also
reinforcing our posture against other forms of provocation and striving
to be ready by configuring period of focus in more vulnerable time of
the year.

       - Against possible provocation in the West Sea, the ROK naval


-----

forces maintain a stronger force level compared to North Korea.
ROK Navy is also improved operational control and support
system.

    - To prepare against coastal infiltration, an integrated security
system has been established at the Inchon Airport. Joint operation
posture was also improved.

    - A low-altitude, low-speed air surveillance was improved, and joint
air defense training for each corridor has been reinforced.

    - All units are trained to prepare for many different possible
non-military threats.

- To be fully prepared for terrorist attacks, we have established a new
NBC Command, improved counter-terrorism training, and ROK-US
coordination. For security at the 2002 World Cup Games and Busan
Asian Games, the military will work closely with the government
security headquarters for these sporting events, by inspecting the
facilities, providing security recommendations and training stadium
security units. We maintain reinforcement readiness in case of
contingency and the ROK-US combined defense system. .

- We have also revised the Integrated Defense Law and Defense
Guidelines to reflect an integrated defense by civilian, government and
military sectors, and improved the Hwarang Training Program. An
integrated defense by the local governments has been improved to
promote the consensus of security and comprehensive defense of the
nation


-----

#### 2-2 Management and Training of Reserve Forces

    - To promote an effective organization and management in the current
conditions of the reserve forces, all reserve units have been equipped
with computerized programs.

Status of Reserve Forces

(December 31, 2000)

    - Education and training for reservists focus on nurturing capabilities for
effective wartime mobilization and homeland defense operation and
instilling a sense of patriotism via practical national security courses.

### 3.ROK-US Alliance, External Military  Exchanges &Cooperation, and  Peacekeeping Operations (PKO)

#### 3-1 ROK-US Alliance and Korean Security

    - During the June 2001 ROK-US Defense Ministerial Talks and the 33rd
Annual ROK-US Security Consultative Meeting (November 2001), ROK
and the US reaffirmed their close policy coordination after the
inauguration of the new Bush Administration.

    - The 33rd SCM was held under the changing international security
environment with the September 11 terrorist attack and publication of
the new Quadrennial Defense Review. In the meeting, military issues
including military   support to guarantee successful hosting of the
World Cup and the Asian Games, Special Measures Agreement (SMA),
and Land Partnership Plan were discussed.

    - Our government agreed to provide an adequate amount of burden
sharing support that would minimize the burden on our budget, yet
maintain the readiness of the USFK. The contribution for 2002 will be
$490 million, which is approximately a 10% increase from the 2001
amount of $440 million. The SMA contribution will compensate for
USFK's Korean won currency expenditure in Korea. It also
contributes to employment, domestic economy and regional
development.

    - The Land Partnership Plan is a mid to long term plan that will
consolidate USFK installations that are segmented throughout the
country, and return the unused facilities. It is expected that civil
inconveniences and appeals regarding the USFK will significantly
decrease.

Joint Press Release for the 33rd SCM


-----

Minister Kim reiterated his government's offer to provide necessary support
to the effort of rooting out terrorism in the wake of the attacks on the
United States on September 11. Secretary Rumsfeld thanked Minister Kim for
the Republic of Korea's support for Operation Enduring Freedom and
increasing force protection on the Korean peninsula in response to the threat
of international terrorism. The secretary and the minister agreed that
terrorism is a common enemy of mankind and that resolute action is
necessary to eradicate it as a threat to the U.S., Korea and the international
community as a whole. They reaffirmed the importance of close U.S. and
ROK cooperation across the spectrum of anti-terrorism and counter-terrorism
activities. The ROK expressed its understanding of the importance of the
development by the U.S. of the means to protect itself and its allies from
terrorist organizations and their state sponsors who might employ weapons of
mass destruction and long-range delivery systems. The minister raised his
concerns about the possible threat of terrorism to the success of the World
Cup, which the ROK will co-host with Japan in 2002, and the Asian games,
which the ROK will host in Busan in 2002.

Talks would be resumed at the earliest possible date so that military

#### 1-5. Trends in Defense Budget Allocation

    - Our defense budget for '01 is 2.8% of GDP and 15.5% of government
budget. For the last 5 years, the average growth of defense budget
has been 4.8%, which is less than a half of the growth rate for total
government budget of 10.6%.

    - Compared to other countries, our defense budget is considered not
high. Rather, it is lower than the world average of 4.1%('99). Other
countries with imminent security threats, such as Israel, Pakistan and
Taiwan, have defense budget around 8.2%, a rate almost three times
higher.

    - Per capita defense spending for Korea is around $256, but other
countries show much higher figures ; Israel $1,465, Singapore $1,174,
USA $1,036, Taiwan $687, Russia $380, and Japan $353.

    - As a new weapons system requires 10 to 15 years for actual
deployment. Although Korea is going through severe economic
hardship, defense investment cannot be delayed

### 3. Fostering Elite Force for the Information Era

#### 3-1. Building Digital Elite Force based on Knowledge and    Information

    - Establishing Integrated Defense Information System To cope with the
rapidly advancing information technology, MND has changed the target
year of Defense Digitalization from 2015 years to 2010 years to build
'New Defense for the 21st Century'. Our military will foster digital
force that can conduct information warfare based on knowledge and
information. Each personnel will have the superiority in real-time
information and integrated battlefield management for guaranteed
survivality and mobility at both war and peace time.

    - Establishing a Command and Control System for Integrated Battlefield
Management Capability

       - Integrated battlefield management combined command, control,
communications and information that enables real-time surveillance
and strike capability. Our military will develop combined C4I,
tactical C4I of each service, national emergency planning, for the
Joint C4I that will take into account all-out national effort and
combined operations.

       - An integrated resource management system manages both tangible
and intangible resources according to its function, mission and life
cycle. We will establish a combat service support system in
conjunction with the battlefield management system that will work
both war and peace time

    - Information Infrastructure for Guaranteed Operation at both War and
Peace Time

       - Hyper-speed networks, satellite communications, wireless LANs,
and portable terminals will be issued that will provide information
infrastructure for individual personnel and establish a"Defense
Enterprise Information Center".

       - Specialized units to protect resources from cyber-terrorism and
conduct information warfare will be expanded and
counter-infiltration and denial system will soon be further
installed.

    - Information Training for the Servicemen

       - The military is leading the field in training experts for the
information society as well as building a digitalized force for the
21st centur

       - To achieve this goal, we have 177 computer training facilities for
division and brigade levels, and 1,615 facilities for a battalion
level. - 142,792 personnel have obtained the 2nd level
information technician in 2000 - 194,171 personnel qualified as of
November and 200,000 is the target in December 2001

### 4. Promoting Welfare for Servicemen and Encourage  Military Personnel

#### 4-1. Fostering and Managing Elite Force

    - Our defense personnel management policy focuses on efficient
personnel management system and structure to train our man to be
experts and specialists. To do so, the proportion of officers will be
increased and experts from both military and civilian sector will be
recruited along with expanding female recruitment.

    - The military will open its door to women of fine calibre. Since
February 2001, MND has implemented a plan to expand recruitment of
women. The current proportion is 1.6% (as of November 2001) of all
officers and by the year 2020, it will be 5%.

    - The newly added servicewomen will serve in areas such as legal,
medicine and dentistry. In the end, they will be mostly in technical and
administrative areas. They will not serve in artillery, amour, submarine
or the chaplain corps.

Recruitment of Female Personnel

#### 4-2. Promoting Welfare to Improve'Quality of Life'

    - Improving the work environment for professional soldiers

       - To improve the welfare in the military, the government will
increase the salaries of servicemen on par with the private sector
by 2004 in accordance with government's plan to make salaries
more rational. Salary-adjustment payment will be newly installed
and basic salary will be increased to rationalize various benefits. .

       - A total of 281.3 billion won was invested in 2001 to provide
3,733 family housing and 3,823 BOQ rooms. Issues of housing
shortage and substandard housing have been significantly resolved.

       - Servicemen will be exempt from consumption tax. Education will
be provided to service members children, and more housing units
are scheduled to be built.

       
    - Enhancing Welfare for the retired

       - Employment rate of retired professional soldiers has only been
around 28.7% for the last 5 years. Therefore, training is provided
to help them find jobs as well as subsidy for courses.

       - Defense Employment Support Center at the Defense Affairs
Institute will be expanded and developed to assist servicemen who
are leaving the military. It will help find jobs in and outside the
military, and pursue enactment of law to make a quota for
employing former servicemen in civilian sector.

       - Also, recruitment service center will be set up to help soldier
who leave the military service.

following categories can be exempt from service upon their request;

       - A person who receives?Government Benefit for the Poor?and has
difficulties in finding means of transportation and lodging, as well
as meals.

       - Single person family in the area of service (not if a family
member lives in the area)

       - A person who must support family members who cannot provide
food and shelter for themselves

    - An individual who was either imprisoned or confined can serve in
another area after finishing his term in a penal facility. This person
can
serve in same area if he feels that it would not be a problem.

    - From 2001, servicemen in designated enterprises can be transferred to
another enterprise after one year, instead of two years. If the
servicemen wish to leave the enterprise from unjust or illegal
treatment by the employer, this restriction does not apply. This new
