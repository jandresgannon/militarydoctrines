**NATIONAL DEFENCE DIRECTIVE 2020**

**INTRODUCTION**

Defence is a public service that contributes to maintaining the security and
the rights and freedoms of all Spanish citizens in any situation. Guaranteeing
National Defence is, therefore, the duty of every government.

In this context, the Armed Forces are the specialized instrument to ensure an
effective defence against any security challenge of a military nature. Under
the leadership of the Government, supported by its citizens, and
complemented by other State security instruments, the Armed Forces must
be ready and able to face constant adaptation and transformation that will
enable them to tackle multiple and changing threats and challenges.

Since the publication of the National Defence Directive 2012, the global security
situation has evolved significantly. In addition, the COVID-19 crisis and
documents such as the European Union Global Strategy have shifted perceptions
about security in Europe and the way to manage it. The commencement of a new
legislative term seems to be the right time to review and modernize the guidelines
of the Defence policy, undertaking an in-depth update of the National Defence
Directive and thus initiating a new planning cycle, rooted in the 2015 National
Security Law and the 2017 National Security Strategy.

The Defence of Spain is founded, on the one hand, on its own capabilities and
strengths as a contribution to a National Security that is conceived as an
integrating whole and, on the other hand, on the practice of an effective
multilateralism that better defends and promotes our interests and values. In this
regard, the capacity to support and cooperate with civilian authorities in crisis and
emergency management is of vital importance.

The security threats and challenges we face are complex and transnational in
nature and must be addressed globally. Membership in major international
organizations with responsibilities in Security and Defence, and the existence of
a wide network of bilateral relations, enable our country to be integrated into a
robust and flexible system, which acts as a multiplier of our capabilities and our
influence on risk situations.

Spain offers itself to the world as a responsible and supportive partner, fully
committed to peace and to the improvement of global stability. Today, our country
is a security provider with its own specific model, based on respect for the
sovereignty and idiosyncrasies of other peoples, on empathy in dealing with other


-----

populations, on interest in Human Security, as an element of conflict prevention,
and on our Armed Forcesâ€™ experience of over thirty years participating in
operations outside our national territory.

Preserving this model and further contributing to security in an efficient manner
requires appropriate resources, both human and material as well as financial. The
full integration of women, as well as the capability to attract talent in a world
dominated by technology, are other necessary requirements to guarantee that
our Armed Forces continue to be an example of modernity and professional
excellence, permanently adapting to the new security challenges and seeking to
contribute to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals of the 2030
Agenda.

**THE STRATEGIC SCENARIO**

This past decade has witnessed substantial changes in the international
security architecture, resulting in a notable erosion of the international order
and the unusual prominence of the use of force. The relationship between
governments and the people they rule has also changed dramatically. The
media and digital communications have contributed to making these changes
happen.

Security challenges now come from both state actors, in intense strategic
competition among them, and non-state actors (terrorism and organized
crime), with significant capillarity between them, particularly evident in
disinformation actions and cyberattacks. Sometimes, as is the case with
climate change or even pandemics, challenges are not the consequence of a
hostile or deliberate act, although they may pose a major threat. In any event,
citizens demand that their values, interests and way of life be protected,
bearing in mind not only the present but also the future.

In order to address this combination of challenges, Defence has moved from
being a concept aimed at managing specific threats to contributing, with its
own idiosyncrasy, to an integrating National Security system. Defence
provides unique capabilities, specialization and availability to increase the
possibilities of action in multiple scenarios, including the challenging fight
against international terrorism and cyberattacks. Although there are no longer
problems exclusive to Defence, Defence is part of the solution to any Security
problem.

Much of the erosion in the international security architecture is connected to
socio-economic phenomena. The consequences of the 2008 economic crisis
have redefined the role of international organizations, economic relations
between states and their relationship with large corporations. Moreover,
certain undesirable consequences of globalization have led to frustration


-----

among large sectors of the population in many countries. This frustration
results in demonstrations -violent at times- rejecting the established systems,
the rise of economic protectionism and the withdrawal of many countries into
themselves, leading to a retreat from the multilateralism that has guided
international relations since the mid-20th century. The change from a
dynamic of negotiation and agreement to one of competition and
confrontation has not yet given rise to any major armed conflicts, although it
does bring this possibility closer.

Paradoxically, new challenges are emerging that no country can manage on
its own. This is the case of the consequences of climate change which, apart
from its direct impact in the form of natural disasters, also affects the
livelihood of the population in some regions, fuelling conflict and forcing mass
migrations.

Also included in this chapter is the security of digital networks, the new critical
resource of the global economy. Safe access to networks and the protection
of private data, and cyberspace in general, is a key element in the security of
the 21[st] century, as is the free access to the remaining global commons that
articulate other forms of global communication and trade, including
international airspace, outer space, sea routes or the seabed.

In a context of withdrawal from the multilateral approach, the European Union
must take on greater responsibilities. In a broader sense, much of the future
of our security lies in the Union, where we contribute decisively to the
development of a coherent and effective Common Security and Defence
Policy. We intend to remain in the leading group of Member States committed
to developing the instruments of the Treaty on European Union relating to
Security and Defence, in order to make this Common Policy more visible and
effective, increase and modernize military capabilities, and strengthen the
European Defence Technological and Industrial Base. Going further in the
Europe of Defence will enable us to fully develop our willingness to contribute
to peace and engender stability in our environment.

This process will also help complement and strengthen the capabilities of the
Atlantic Alliance. We believe in a strong NATO, with a more cohesive and
capable European component, an effective NATO capable of confronting any
challenge to its citizens, wherever they may come from. The Atlantic Alliance
is a crucial link to cooperate in the defence of shared peace and security
interests on both sides of the Atlantic.

The spirit guiding these two axes of multilateralism, the European Union and
NATO, can be clearly seen in our commitment to the United Nations, whose
leadership in conflict prevention and resolution we decisively support and
which gives legitimacy to the operations of our Armed Forces abroad.


-----

The action scenarios for our Armed Forces have become more complex since
the publication of the previous National Defence Directive in 2012. The use
of hybrid strategies combining conventional and asymmetric procedures
leads to a framework of intense confrontation in cyberspace and in the
information environment. The use of force goes hand in hand with
psychological campaigns designed to discredit our own actions and spread
confusion in public opinion. In the cyberspace and information fields, it is
usual for some adversaries to hide their actions and apply their strategies in
a grey zone, located below what has been identified as our response
threshold.

Finally, the geopolitical environment is increasingly influenced by the race to
reach leading positions in the new technological revolution. Advances such
as the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, quantum computing, genetic
engineering, robotization or the use of outer space will worryingly transform
the daily lives of individuals and societies, and will also lead to a revolution in
security and defence matters.

**GENERAL GUIDELINES AND OBJECTIVES OF THE DEFENCE POLICY**

a. The first objective of Defence is to protect Spanish society as a whole,

its Constitution, and the values, principles and institutions it enshrines
in order to ensure the full exercise of the rights and freedoms of all
citizens, as well as to guarantee the sovereignty, independence and
integrity of Spain and its constitutional order, pursuant to article 8.1 of
the Constitution.

b. Contributing to the preservation of international peace and security

within the framework of the commitments undertaken by Spain is also
a priority objective of Defence.

c. To achieve both objectives, it is necessary to ensure the credibility of

National Defence, which is the basis for deterrence and an essential
condition for an effective multilateral contribution and integration. This
credibility is based on the availability of capabilities that guarantee a
reasonable level of autonomous defence and enable us to exert a
degree of influence outside our borders, commensurate with the weight
and interests of Spain as a country.

d. In the scenario that includes the national territory and the areas of

sovereignty and interest â€“maritime, air, and those of cyberspace with
a defence dimension- Spain will usually act with its own capabilities.
The Armed Forces will conduct their permanent missions, often
supporting civilian authorities to counter challenges that are not always
conventional. Cooperation with and support to civilian authorities


-----

reaches its highest expression in the management of crisis and
emergency situations. This scenario will embody the comprehensive
approach in the management of National Security, combining the
actions of the Ministry of Defence with those of other Departments and
security and intelligence agencies.

e. Beyond our borders, the standard practice will be to operate within

concerted multinational frameworks, preferably within the United
Nations, the EU Common Security and Defence Policy or NATO. The
purpose will be to contribute to peace and, simultaneously, to
consolidate Spain as a referential partner and ally, also included in ad
hoc international coalitions that operate in support of international law
and UN Security Council Resolutions.

f. In addition to its own capabilities and its integration in international

organizations, Spain's Defence will be founded on a wide network of
bilateral relations with other countries. Our actions within this network
will be oriented towards establishing cooperation and confidencebuilding dynamics, strengthening the overall action of the State and the
coordination of initiatives before international organizations. Defence
Diplomacy and the bilateral Agreements and Treaties in force play a
prominent role in establishing this climate of trust, solidarity and
collaboration.

g. In order to deal with hybrid strategies, the goal will be to achieve an

appropriate integration of available resources in all areas, whether
civilian or military, national or multinational, to preserve security,
improve strategic communication, increase confidence in institutions
and bolster the resilience of society.

h. In the area of prevention and comprehensive response to global

threats, particular importance is attached to intelligence - enhancing
the capabilities of the National Intelligence Centre and promoting the
coordination of activities of intelligence bodies, actions in cyberspace,
and the responsible management of public information.

i. In order to manage the consequences of climate change, it will be

increasingly necessary to ensure the integration of capabilities and
efforts, both military, such as those of the Military Emergencies Unit,
and civilian, in line with the objectives and principles of the 2030
Agenda.

j. When these actions take place abroad, respect for local cultures, our

soldiersâ€™ empathy with the civilian population, and a genuine
assistance that cannot be labelled as self-serving, will be crucial factors
for Spain to succeed in the promotion and integration of the values of


-----

peace, freedom, diversity, equity and justice.

k. New formulas will be promoted in peacekeeping operations seeking to

avoid a conflict stalemate and enhance agreement between the
parties. The contribution of women, whether from local populations or
serving in the Armed Forces, may be an enabling factor in the
disruption of the conflict, which could stimulate its resolution by
providing an innovative point of view. Spain will continue to apply a
stabilization model which will avoid imposition, and will promote
solutions that are consensual and respectful of the local population.

l. Our Armed Forces are required to maintain an advanced technological

level enabling an operational capability in line with the evolution of new
technologies. This entails promoting and protecting an innovative
Defence industry, capable of being integrated into multinational
projects and business groups, particularly at European level.
Technological excellence requires appropriate economic investment,
which allows for the promotion of three key activities: research,
development and innovation; talent recruitment; and training.


m. Promoting defence awareness and culture is a priority objective as

there cannot be an effective defence without the interest and
concurrence of our citizens. Bringing Defence closer to the people is
an essential part of the National Security culture to achieve a
committed society, playing an active part in its security.

n. The Armed Forces will foster a better quality of life and better

educational opportunities for their men and women, and will strengthen
the support to their families. The excellence of the human element in
our Armed Forces should be further consolidated through decent living
and working conditions, attractive career possibilities, an environment
of inclusion and equality for men and women, and the certainty of being
valued by our citizens.

**OPERATIONAL GUIDELINES**

1. Developing the exclusive competence of the State in defence matters

to meet the needs of National Defence requires a broad and inclusive
approach, under the leadership of the Government, together with an
effective coordination of all resources and instruments, which commits
the ministerial departments, especially the Ministry of Defence, and all
relevant public administrations.

2. Defence policy will be guided by the continued quest for peace, stability

and the promotion of Human Security, adopting as principle the respect


-----

for International Law and Human Rights, in accordance with the
Charter and Resolutions of the United Nations. The practice of
multilateralism and concerted action with partners and allies will be the
primary methods for managing our defence abroad.

3. Regardless of Spain's contribution to the effort of the international

community, the Ministry of Defence will undertake the necessary
operational and capability planning to address any potential challenges
or non-shared threats in defence of the rights and freedoms of Spanish
citizens and its contribution to the threats and challenges to National
Security.

4. The Ministry of Defence will promote the training of Armed Forces

personnel and the acquisition of skills enabling them to cooperate with
and support civilian authorities, particularly in crisis and/or emergency
situations.

5. A major priority for the Ministry of Defence will be the quality of life and

safe and decent working conditions of the members of the Armed
Forces, including appropriate measures to reconcile family and
professional life, as well as the full integration and increased presence
of women in the military profession.

6. The Government will provide resolute support to the Ministry of

Defence in promoting Defence Awareness and Culture, within the
framework of the National Security culture, offering accurate and
attractive information, and encouraging all Spaniards to be aware of
the daily activities of their Armed Forces, and how they contribute to
the protection and promotion of social progress and the welfare of all
citizens.

7. The progress of the EU Common Security and Defence Policy is the

cornerstone for promoting our principles and values, expanding
stability in our environment and managing our main security
challenges. We will maintain a high level of initiative and commitment
to the main instruments of the Common Policy, such as Missions and
Operations, Permanent Structured Cooperation, technological and
industrial cooperation, and participation in defence financial

instruments, thus forging the necessary alliances with our main
European partners.

8. NATO, with its 70 years of history, is a basic pillar of our Collective

Defence. Our contribution will be implemented in a supportive manner
by providing capabilities and forces to its structures and operations and
encouraging the adaptation of the Alliance to security challenges
coming from any direction. Spain will advocate for a combination of


-----

deterrence and dialogue in the political debate within NATO opting for
solutions that favour dÃ©tente and establish confidence-building
measures and fora. Likewise, consensus and political control will be
sought in allied actions.

9. We will seek to achieve an appropriate balance in the contribution of

our Armed Forces to the missions and operations of major international
organisations (EU, NATO, UN) by focusing our efforts on our
deployments and taking into account the added value of the different
missions, paying special attention to the immediate European
environment, the Mediterranean, the Western Sahel and the Atlantic
Ocean.

10. In their operations abroad, the Armed Forces will pay special attention

to the protection of vulnerable groups, in particular women and
children, supporting the implementation of the United Nations Women,
Peace and Security Agenda and the Safe Schools Initiative. The
promotion of women as effective actors in mediation and conflict
resolution will also be enhanced.

11. Defence diplomacy and the network of bilateral relations will be

strengthened. Special attention will be paid to cooperation with our
neighbours and strategic partners. The relationship in the field of
Defence with Ibero-America and African countries, particularly with
those closest to Spain, is also of particular interest given the
importance of the shared challenges and opportunities that result from
mutual support.

12. Inter-ministerial cooperation mechanisms as well as those with other

public administrations will be consolidated, striving for coherence,
effectiveness and rationality in the use of the public resources that
guarantee the National Security System.

13. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, European Union and Cooperation and

the Ministry of Defence will promote the need for contributing to dÃ©tente
and dialogue at international level through the renewal and effective
strengthening of Arms Control Treaties and confidence and security
building measures.

14. The strengthening of the national defence industry and the

development of a European Defence Technological and Industrial
Base will be a priority and the best way to ensure that the Armed
Forces' equipment remains at the technological forefront. The Ministry
of Defence, in close coordination with other departments responsible
for technology and innovation, will promote opportunities and projects
for collaboration with the European defence industry in competitive


-----

conditions. It will also pay particular attention to the dual-use and
possible enabling role of these technologies for the overall benefit of
society and for the maintenance and creation of high-quality
employment. Spain must participate in key technological projects to
increase the capabilities of the European Union.

15. In order to assume these responsibilities at national and international

level, the Armed Forces must be able to sustain the permanent
deployment of the number of troops established by the Defence Policy
Directive with the Government's approval, and when the situation so
requires, increase their efforts by at least 50% for a maximum period
of one year. In addition to land, naval and air forces, these deployments
should include all appropriate additional capabilities, in particular cyber
defence, intelligence, special operations, military use of outer space
and civil-military cooperation (CIMIC).

16. The development of these guidelines will require the necessary funding

to also address international commitments, the renewal and
sustainment of military capabilities and, in particular, special attention
will be paid to the needs and quality of life of Armed Forces personnel.
