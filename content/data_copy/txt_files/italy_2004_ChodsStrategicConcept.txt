## 1. INTRODUCTION
 General
 The basic mission of the Armed Forces is to defend the Nation and to safeguard free national institutions from every possible threat.The nature of this mission, which has been significantly altered in the past few years, will continue to be of a highly dynamic nature, unknown at the time of the “Cold War”, in relation to the changing international scenario. The global threat of terrorism, the potential use of weapons of mass destruction, regional instability and possible undemining of vital national interests, even outside of national territory, represent the great threats to security in the twenty-first century. Facing such dynamics requires a continued process of adaptation of forces, doctrine and capabilities of the military, coherent with similar processes begun both within the framework of NATO and the European Union, and by those Nations with which Italy maintains strong ties of cooperation, so that Italy will be in a position to respond to future threats without disruption and in a timely and efficient manner. The multilayered and unpredictable nature of future threats, above all those of terrorism and failing states, demands development of a capability to prevent and, when necessary, to intervene quickly and efficiently even at a great distance from the homeland. In other words, unlike in the past, the military contribution to national security can no longer depend exclusively on the capability to guard and provide static defense of the metropolitan areas (“Homeland defense”); it must develop the capability to dynamically face threats whenever and wherever they occurs. Key requisites of this new capability are a solid structure, thoroughly integrated in command and information, and a high capability to intervene in a timely manner at the lowest possible level of intensity, with a heightened precision of engagement in addition to full operational and technological superiority over the possible adversary. In a few words, what is needed are “net-centric” Armed Forces that unites a high capability for surveillance, command and control with a ready availability of forces that are flexible and essentially “expeditionary”, trained and culturally prepared to operate in synergy according to “effect-based” doctrines.

## Preparing for this challenge requires a clear and innovative vision, projected across the coming decade, that will pragmatically and coherently guide the process of transformation of the structure, capability and employment of the armed forces.
 Purpose
 The purpose of this document is to provide a strategic vision of the context of military security, to define the conceptual reference points that will guide the process of continued transformation of the military, and, finally, to indicate the general goals to be accomplished in the short, medium and long terms.
 Goals
 Coherent with the transformation currently underway in NATO and in the European Union, major goals we intend to pursue are: - to define the nature of operations, the concepts governing employment, capabilities and structures of forces the Nation will need to successfully perform assigned missions in the next fifteen years;
 - to provide a solid conceptual base to guide the general planning process and decisions that will provide funding for the modernization and renewal of the Armed Forces;
 - to sustain the process of transformation of the Armed Forces, indicating key priorities for the development of force structures, employment and capabilities, based on foreseeable human, financial and legislative resources that the Nation will set aside for the process;
 - to provide a framework of reference for the development of new concepts and capabilities on which to focus research and experimentation;
 - to sustain the development of a coherent and shared military culture, by means of joint and multinational activity as well as within the Armed Forces through external and internal debate focused on the present and future transformation process.

 2. FRAMEWORK
 Tasks and missions of the Armed Forces
 Tasks that have been established for the Armed Forces by national legislation remain unchanged, as do the missions indicated in the Ministerial Directive. They are listed below in order of strategic

## importance, which does not necessarily reflect the probability of their occurring: - to defend vital interests of the Nation against any possible aggression, with the aim of safeguarding the integrity of national territory – land, territorial waters and air space – as well as the security and integrity of lines of communication and the security of areas of national sovereignity and of Italian citizens residing abroad, from any possible threat;
 - to safeguard the European-Atlantic area, within the framework of the Nation’s strategic and/or vital interests, by contributing to the collective defense of NATO;
 - to contribute to the management of international crises, by participating in crisis prevention and management operations with the goal of guaranteeing international peace, security, stability and legitimacy, as well as affirming fundamental human rights in the spirit of the United Nations Charter, within the framework of international organizations – above all NATO, the EU and the UN – and/or bi- and multi-lateral agreements, with particular regard to Europe’s capability to manage crises autonomously;
 - to contribute in safeguarding of free institutions and in carrying out specific tasks in the event of catastophes and in other cases of extraordinary need and urgency.
 The same Ministerial Directive indicates, for all four of the above- mentioned missions, the overriding necessity of extending military action to the most recent forms of asymmetric conflict, with particular reference to international terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.  At the conceptual level, the four missions must not be considered separately but as an integrated whole, insofar as they contribute together to the process of guaranteeing the defense and the security of the Nation. Furthermore, the planning and readiness of the military must be developed with a unified vision and must be flexible enough to allow for an efficient employment of the Forces as soon as the necessity manifests itself.
 General strategic considerations
 The assessment of the general security context cannot be separated from the fact that the future will continue to be very uncertain insofar as potential military threats are concerned, as well

5


-----

## as in the way such threats and attacks to national security could occur even from nonmilitary sources. The recent episodes of international terrorism that have been perpetrated through a warlike use of non-military means have proven that we must expect rapid and unforeseen changes in the risks we must face. Add to this the fact that new technologies can revolutionize forms of political, economic and military competition, as well as the existence of further potential destabilization factors tied to political/social phenomena such as immigration and illegal traffic, and it becomes evident that the nature of possible conflicts and threats is destined to undergo significant and unpredictable changes. Such changes call for major adjustments to the type of forces and the doctrines of force employment, above all in terms of flexibility and diversified reaction capability, so as to enable them to reach the desired effects. Furthermore, the aspects of national security and defense are more and more closely bound and this close connection constitutes one of the main innovative factors taken into consideration in defining the essence of the Armed Forces. Although it is possible to affirm, with a reasonable level of confidence, that the near future does not present a plausible threat of the traditional type to the territorial integrity of the Nation, the swiftly-evolving international geopolitical context does not allow us to discount the possibility of certain forms of threat to our national territory or to our vital interests both within and across our boundaries. In particular, the tragic events of September 11, 2001 and March 11, 2004 have proven that no Nation may be considered safe from a possible attack on its population, its territory or its infrastructures.  Furthermore, an ever greater number of countries is acquiring, or has the potential to acquire, the capability to carry out missile attacks, either of a conventional nature or with NBCR warheads. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization guarantees an elevated level of stability and security in Europe, but in other nearby areas exist conditions of political and social instability that can potentially put Italian interests in crisis or at risk, as well as threaten the strategic balance of the region. Italy in particular will continue to depend, in the near future, on the energy resources coming from the Persian Gulf and North Africa, areas that are characterized by major

## instability and in which various Nations are developing or attempting to develop weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile capabilities, while at the same time increasing their conventional forces. Some of these Nations, moreover, do not intervene decisively in the deterrence of international terror organizations. The absence of strong democratic structures in various countries within the area of strategic interest can create a fertile ground for the strengthening of international crime or terrorist organizations and for the development of illicit activities such as the traffic of drugs, arms and illegal immigrants. Incapacity of some of these countries to stop or prevent the use of their territory, economic resources and social structures by international terrorist or criminal organizations – or in some cases the harboring, support and protection offered to such organizations through the direct involvement of their military forces, secret services or institutions – presents a severe threat to international stability and to peace in general. Finally, one must consider the great complexity of the factors and of the relations of cause and effect that determine a crisis and that make it difficult to foresee the rise of conflicts in time to forestall them. The complexity of international relations, greatly augmented in recent years by the progressive globalization of the economies and the increased cultural interaction, makes it very difficult to analyze events and consequently to precisely identify the possible crisis situations. It is even more difficult to “geographically isolate”  these situations within clearly circumscribed areas. Equally complex is the identification of the direct or indirect effects of such situations on the interests of Italy itself and of the Alliances in which Italy takes part.
 Areas of national interest
 The areas of “national interest” are those geographic zones in which and toward which the Political Authorities may decide to take initiatives, even of a military nature, for the purpose of safeguarding the interests of the Nation, and potentially also within the framework of the international organizations to which Italy belongs.

7


-----

## These areas represent a factor that conditions the planning of forces and the determination of the structural capabilities of the Armed Forces. They are subdivided into: - areas of “strategic interest” which, at the moment, comprise the national territory and adjacent areas: NATO, the European Union, the Balkans, Eastern Europe, the Caucasus, North Africa and the Horn of Africa, the Near and Middle East and the Persian Gulf. These are areas in which the Political Authorities are more likely to take action for the safeguarding of the Country’s vital and/or strategic interests (Attachment 1);
 - “other areas”, i.e. geographical areas in which the Political Authorities may decide to intervene according to the situation.  Among these the most likely intervention would be for low- or middle-intensity crisis management operations, or for humanitarian assistance in the continent of Africa. 
 The “Strategic Vision” of NATO and the European Union, both characterized by a steady process of enlargement with significant effects on the geostrategic asset of the European continent, no longer define borders or geographic boundaries for a possible intervention. This does not mean that NATO and the European Union are ready to intervene in any part of the globe, but that the radius of action will be determined by the specific strategic situation, the assessment and the political consensus of the moment, on a case-by-case basis.
 Military Implications
 In order to answer challenges of the new strategic context, the Armed Forces must adopt a holistic approach (global, integrated, interdisciplinary), aimed at developing highly synergic operational capabilities suitable for the carrying out of a wide spectrum of missions, from humanitarian operations to crisis prevention and management to high-intensity conflict. These capabilities must be developed within a multidisciplinary, joint and multinational framework. The national Armed Forces will operate mainly in multilateral contexts and in close cooperation and coordination with international, national and non-governmental organizations.  Future military operations will therefore be ever more strongly tied to other initiatives of a political, diplomatic, economic, social, legal and informational nature; such initiatives will have to be carried out in a measured, coordinated and cooperative manner.

8


-----

## Military action must therefore be considered an important element within a greater set of national and international interventions, within an interdisciplinary context in which the military component must be capable of merging in a flexible and uninterrupted way in order to provide, through qualified and diversified operational capabilities, the necessary framework of security and the indispensable credibility and deterrence that will support the other components. Certain crisis management and peacekeeping operations require a spectrum of operational capabilities similar to those required for a high-intensity conflict. It can not be excluded that, in a multilateral or NATO context, partial or prevalent high-intensity operations will be conducted in order to safeguard vital or strategic interests. Similarly, the recurrence, in the longer term, of traditional military threats to Italian or to NATO territory can not be excluded beforehand. For these reasons, even though responding to asymmetric threats, managing crises and conducting post- conflict stabilization activity will represent the most frequent forms of intervention, the Armed Forces must maintain the capability to conduct, within the framework of coalitions, high-intensity operations with forces capable of contrasting - in quantity and quality - significant threats. The management of “information” – understood not only as the traditional gathering, analysis and distribution of “intelligence” but also as the capability to make full use of the data available in order to focus, in an innovative and synergic manner, the action of the military on the desired effect – will constitute a critical element for the prediction, prevention or containment of future threats. In time this will require the improvement of the level of integration of Italian capabilities in order to bring them up to those of NATO;  furthermore, the decision-making process must be rendered more efficient and quick. Future missions will require trained forces that can be rapidly configured to their different typologies, capable of being projected, mobile, sustainable in time, highly interoperable and flexible. In other words, they must be capable of efficiently facing the unpredictable and different strategies and operational capabilities offered by their adversaries.

## 3. FUTURE OPERATIONS, FORCES, CONCEPTS OF EMPLOYMENT AND
 CAPABILITIES Operations
 Future operations will tend to be more complex and multidimensional and will therefore require a strong capability to adapt to changes in operational scenarios, from high-intensity to post-conflict stabilization and peacekeeping. The challenges that the Armed Forces will need to face require first of all an innovative approach to the traditional concepts of employment of forces. The planning and execution of future operations will demand an ever increasing tendency toward “joint” and “combined” forces. This will require not only a greater coordination and integration within the Italian Armed Forces but also an increased interoperability with the Allied Forces. In addition to this distinctive capability toward interaction, the forces will have to be prepared to enter rapidly, efficiently and uninterruptedly into complex scenarios, marked by the coxistence of actors, organizations and civilian and military realities that will be both multinational and diversified. The capability to gather, organize and share acquired data, by means of a robust net-centric C4I system, will make it possible to transform the organizational structures of the units, formations and Commands in order to render them more capable of confronting future operations. One of the key elements of success therefore rests on the exploitation of the opportunities offered by emerging technologies for the multiplication of forces and the rapid reconfiguration of equipment, with the goal of maintaining a clear technological and operational advantage capable of producing the desidered effect at the required moment. In order to carry out the assigned missions, the Armed Forces must be prepared to conduct operations aimed at deterring and combatting unexpected but foreseeably limited military and/or terrorist threats to the national territory. This requires presence and surveillance capabilities combined with the capability to respond quickly and flexibly, even at a distance, as required by the constitutional duty of defending the Country. Within this context are included the activities specifically connected with “Homeland Security”, which require an elevated integrational and

10


-----

## interdisciplinary capability both at the national and at the multinational level (surveillance and protection of sensitive areas and targets, control/prevention of illicit traffic, antiterrorism and counterterrorism, prevention of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, etc.) Additional activities include assistance, as mandated by law, provided when necessary to national agencies/institutions that are responsible for the safekeeping of free institutions in case of catastrophes, or to those agencies/institutions having to do with public welfare [ascribed to the so-called “External Functions”], i.e. military assistance to the civilian community. Outside national territory, the Armed Forces must be capable of sustaining various engagements related to the support of diplomatic action, crisis management, and low- or medium- intensity post-conflict management on a global level in support of  national interests and within the context of coalitions or alliances. A certain amount of highly combat-ready forces for brief and intense engagements must be planned for, from the initial phases of any possible crisis. In the first case, emphasis will be placed less on “combat” capabilities and more on “combat support,” “combat service support” and availability of adequate command structures for the support of long-range operations on the multinational level.  In the second case, instead, emphasis must be placed on the creation of “packages” with complete capabilities, limited in dimension, with a high level of operational readiness, capable of conducting multinational operations projecting high-intensity “early effect”, within a particularly complex and structured C4-ISTAR context.
 Forces and Personnel
 The forces of the future must be agile, “joint” and “expeditionary” in nature, capable of operating in “net-centric” contexts along the entire spectrum of conflicts, rapidly deployable and sustainable at length even at great distances from the mother country. The core of these forces must possess a technological level of excellence within the framework of the generally high qualitative level of the Armed Forces. The structure of these forces will, furthermore, have to be basically flexible (i.e. capable of rapidly adapting to changing conditions),

11


-----

## and must be characterized by the capability to adapt to the peculiar nature of specific presumable scenarios. Manning these forces will require highly motivated Officers, Non- commissioned Officers and troops, of an adequate cultural level, educated and trained in both a national and international context. In addition, the civilian personnel working for the Ministry of Defense will need to be more integrated with the military personnel, acquiring new and more structured capabilities by participating more actively in training cycles. Finally, it will be necessary to find a new system of complementary forces, with particular emphasis for so-called reserve forces, capable of replacing the current National Service-based system, which will be entirely suspended by 2005.
 Concepts of employment
 In developing the new concepts of employment, multiple limitations and constraining factors must be considered; however,  the main focus must be on the capabilities that will generate the “results” or “effects” necessary to attain desired goals. For this reason, in the conduct of operations the Armed Forces will have to prepare themselves doctrinally, procedurally and technologically for the integrated use of all available means that will favor the immediate effects necessary to attain the desired results (EBO:  Effect Based Operations”). The goal of effect-based operations is the attainment of a precise strategic goal through the implementation of diversified activities throughout all the phases of an operation (pre-crisis, combat, post- conflict etc.).  In each phase, the adversary’s key areas of vulnerability must be defined and dealt with using the most suitable means, possibly even non-military, for the attainment of required goals. In a few words, future operations will focus more on the desired results than on the systems and means available to attain them; the “net-centric” doctrine is fundamental to this new concept. The web interconnection of sensors and of factors necessary to determine planning, decision-making and implementation, will allow us to concentrate the effects, more than the forces, in a spacial-temporal “continuum” that will lead to the attainment of the same results with structures that are dispersed therefore less vulnerable and logistically less complex.

12


-----

## As an example, in combat situations the emphasis will no longer be on the quantity but on the quality and suitability of the forces to achieve superiority through the joint and combined application of knowledge, speed, precision and efficacy of engagement. In the case of post-conflict situations, a positive influence on the stabilization process will be achieved through a greater aptitude, on the part of forces, to enter into the social environment and local institutions of the areas as well as to cooperate with international governing organizations.
 Capabilities
 The Armed Forces must be able to express well-defined operational capabilities, qualitatively comparable to those of the major allied nations, at the same time accepting more limited quantitative levels. The most important among these capabilities are those considered fundamental and prioritary in order to carry out the entire spectrum of missions assigned to the military and, at the same time, to guarantee the greatest flexibility of employment. The Fundamental Operational Capabilities are: C4-ISTAR, deployment and mobility (i.e. rapidity of intervention and action), precision and efficacity of engagement, survival and protection of the forces, logistical sustainability and general support. These are the enabling capabilities for the development of the Armed Forces and the attainment of the goals of the current transformation process. Such enabling capabilities are to be coupled to three general requirements applicable to all Forces and necessary for full achievement of the enabling capabilities themselves. These requirements are: timely availability of the forces, joint integration and multinational interoperability, and interdisciplinary nature (see Attachment 2). The conduct of “effect based” operations in adherence to the concepts expressed in the preceding paragraph, requires a more precise explanation of the lines along which we will seek to attain these capabilities in harmony with our allies. The strategic effects that the attainment of these capabilities will guarantee are the following:
 - decisionmaking superiority, that is, the conditions under which decisions are made, on the basis of the best available information, more quickly than the adversary’s reaction time,

13


-----

## allowing for a more aware and efficient management of crisis situations and operations on the part of the joint and/or coalition forces;
 - efficient operational capability, that is, the conditions under which all components are capable of integrating their capabilities, at the national and multinational level, for the coherent achievement of the desired operational results;
 - deployment and sustainment, that is, the conditions under which the Armed Forces are able to deploy, employ and sustain, in the time and manner requested and in a joint and combined context, forces qualified to absolve the assigned mission.

 4. THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE ARMED FORCES
 General
 In recent years the evolutionary process of the Italian Armed Force has already attained a number of important goals, such as the changeover to a fully professional force, the reform of the military chain of command, the centralization of the direction of operations, and the unification of technical-military intelligence.  Nevertheless, the emergence of new risks and threats, as well as the evolution of the security and defense policies of NATO and the European Union, require a further, continued transformation of the Armed Forces and of the concepts of employment in order to prepare ourselves to operate with success in the operational contexts outlined above. The transformation process which I intend to pursue must necessarily be developed in strict conjunction to the major effort that the Armed Forces are called upon to make on a daily basis in order to conduct real operations. In this framework, national military commitments must be constantly evaluated in order to make them consistent with actual requirements and changing situations. The planning and execution of the transformation process must not have a negative influence on the existing operational capabilities; it must instead enhance them through a continuing and progressive integration of newly-acquired capabilities with existing ones (“operating while transforming”). This calls for a continuing process of review of current force structures, to be performed gradually and with set planning goals.

14


-----

## In this area, integration of the Services represents the focal point of the transformation of our Armed Forces. The goal is to substantially augment joint capabilities by synergically integrating specific operational capabilities of the four Services, at the same time increasing their interoperability with the Armed Forces of the other NATO countries and the European Union. This process must be supported by a substantial commitment to the development of the “net-centric” concepts and capabilities which constitute an outstanding force multiplier as well as the prerequisite for multinational interoperability and the identification of new and more efficient concepts of operational employment.
 Permanent goals
 Continuing goals of this permanent transformation process are: - operational readiness of the Armed Forces, which must be always guaranteed;
 - joint integration; - interoperability, i.e. the capability to integrate with multinational systems/equipment;
 - “expeditionary” connotation, i.e. the intrinsic capability to project and operate continuously in external and distant theatres;
 - “net-centric” capabilities as well as the capability to continuously modernize doctrines and concepts of employment of Forces on the basis of the new possibilities offered by technology.
 Within this framework, Commanders at all levels must seek primarily to obtain:
 - continuous and full operational readiness of the Armed Forces, i.e. the cohesiveness and training of personnel combined with the efficacy of available capabilities - factors whose product gives the actual operational result;
 - full achievement and constant control of the process of joint integration and advanced multinational interoperability, through specific training;
 - fulfillment of a permanent modernization process, capable of creating and maintaining force packages of high-quality capabilities in terms of mobility, C4-ISTAR, protection, survival, precision targeting and logistical sustainability. Such force packages must be able to operate in very advanced

15


-----

## multinational contexts, such as the NATO Response Force (NRF), which are strongly oriented toward new doctrines of employment (EBO) and related support technologies (NEC).
 Long-term goals
 The long-term goal is the creation of Armed Forces balanced in their components and financially sustainable, with operational qualities and capabilities that correspond to security requirements.  This objective must be reached by coupling ongoing conceptual efforts with coherent actions, with the goal of anticipating future needs rather than following contingent necessities. In pursuing the medium to long-term transformation process, I intend to act progressively in three dimensions that are characteristic of the Armed Forces: quantity, quality and capabilities. The initial reference point for the quantitative dimension is a professional force of 190,000 that will, in the long term, reach a correct balance of components – Officers, Non-commissioned Officers and Troops.  It is a dimension proportionate to the level of ambition of a nation that wishes to maintain a relevant role in the multinational context. The realization thereof will require a substantial and progressive increase in the costs tied to personnel and to the necessary infrastructural and logistical support operations. Constant attention must be paid to this aspect insofar as, in relation to the available resources, the quantitative level may end up being inconsistent with the other two dimensions I intend to pursue: quality and capability. The Armed Forces, when called upon to operate in the multinational contexts outlined above, can reach their concrete operational capabilities (“usability”) only if they have available means and systems of a quality comparable to those of other Allied Nations. The uncapability to reach this goal would imply that they cannot perform major roles within coalitions and/or alliances, thus relegating the Italian Armed Forces to secondary roles. In order to attain the above-mentioned goal of quality, which I consider fundamental and prioritary, besides carefully evaluating the quantitative aspects of the Armed Forces it will be necessary to achieve, as far as possible, further rationalization and synergy in support areas of operational forces and in territorial structures.

16


-----

## The dimension of capability requires ready availability of a variety of forces, diversified in their operational type and readiness. From these diversified forces we would derive complete and homogenous high-quality “packages”, to be deployed for national requirements or to be made available as a contribution to coalition operations. The capability dimension is not limited to the acquisition of specific means or systems, but also involves doctrine, training, long-term maintenance of capabilities, leadership, etc. If any of these were to fall short, the result would be a reduced effective capability of the Armed Forces despite substantial investments. In this area, I intend to initiate a process of harmonization and rationalization aimed at maximizing the performance of those areas of capability, whether common or pertaining to a single Service, that are most valuable for the Armed Forces as a whole. At the same time, I plan to identify other areas of capability in which Italy excels and make them available to the process of constituting multinational coalitions. Strictly tied to the dimension of capability, and one of the principal aspects to pursue in the process of transformation of the Armed Forces, is the concept of “usability” of the forces, meant as the capability to effectively convey, in the manner and within requested time limits, different pre-arranged packets of forces, complete and without such shortcomings as to compromise their employment. These actions, together with the identification and a coherent balance of the “areas of excellence” and the “level of national ambition”, are the keys to the development of credible Armed Forces, sustainabile in time, with the realistically available resources. The process of transformation of the Armed Forces will require that we act concurrently on all three of the “levels” discussed above, by means of a calibrated redirection of resources. In preparing the long-term integrated planning process, I intend to give priority to the following capabilities:
 - integrated capabilities of Command, Control, Communication, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance, the so-called C4-ISTAR that constitutes the “core” of any net-centric system;
 - joint expeditionary capability, based on the synergic and integrated contribution of the four Services, in pursuit of the

17


-----

## balance between forces with greater readiness and combat capability and forces that are optimal for post-combat or minor- intensity sustainment operations. The projected forces must especially have a high capability for protection and for efficient integration into the net-centric system;
 - capability to protect and defend national territory, in such a way as to adapt to new risks and threats including, above all, terrorism, weapons of mass destruction and the transportation thereof.
 In summary, long-term planning must be oriented toward a measured reduction of the quantitative dimension of force structure, a marked enhancement of the qualitative dimension, and optimization of the capability dimension with an emphasis on the “usability” of the Armed Forces.
 Medium- and short-term goals
 These are goals derived from the recent Ministerial Directive, consistent with the transformation process outlined above and pursued concomitantly with the actions already initiated. Insofar as the command and control sector is concerned, these goals are:
 - the introduction of a Joint Surveillance and Command System (JSCS), “net-centric” and totally interoperable on the multinational level, aimed at achieving a better national capability to prevent and manage crises in the areas of strategic interesta;
 - the achievement of full operational capability by the the Joint Operational HQ as European “Operation Headquarters” and of a more synergic net-centric interaction with the Commands and Operational Centers of each Service. At the same time, we will work toward pursuing projectable “Joint Force Command” capabilities, which will be achieved primarily through the evolution of the capabilities of the existing Single Service Commands.
 In the area of force planning, priority will be given to: - the attainment of improved capabilities in the sector of strategic mobility (air and maritime);
 - the strenghtening of Special Forces, increasing their numbers and achieving full operational capability of the Joint Command for Special Forces Operations (COFS);

18


-----

## - the improvement of the “expeditionary” structure of various Armed Forces components, especially those with the greatest projectability;
 - the availability for the NRF of command and force structures capable of operating in line with NATO’s evolving doctrine, with particular emphasis on Combat Support and Combat Service Support, projectability and sustainability of forces;
 - the implementation of the Italian contribution to the European Rapid Response Forces (“EU Military Rapid Response Concept”);
 - a joint strenghtening of the amphibious projection capability; - an enhancement of MSU potential, of CIMIC units’ capability for civilian-military interaction, and of NRBC and Engineer detection and defense capabilities;
 - an improvement in the efficiency of national territory security, enhancing surveillance capabilities of air and maritime spaces, air defense and support to homeland security, also against non conventional missile threats.
 Preparation of forces demands a thorough training process that increases capabilities of units and components to operate in joint and combined contexts and with a net-centric and effect-based philosophy. In this context, basic single service training must be integrated with more complex training phases conducted in a joint and combined environment and aimed at increasing the capability of different components to operate in an integrated fashion. This phase must be carried out with the direct involvement of the Joint Operational HQ and must precede deployment of the forces in theatres of operation. The transition to an entirely professional military requires the rapid adoption of modern methods of personnel management and development. This holds true for both military and civilian personnel, in all phases of service including the re-entry into civilian society of military personnel upon retirement. Particular emphasis must be given to forming a mindset that will be more “joint” in nature, as well as to enhancing leadership qualities, reinforcing the sense of belonging, motivation, cohesion and esprit de corps. In this framework I intend to draw up and propose specific measures aimed at improving the welfare of the personnel in light of the increased demands of mobility and employment in distant theatres.

19


-----

## As far as the infrastructures are concerned, I intend to proceed with speed and determination toward identifying the requirements connected with the new, entirely professional armed services as well as with operational support, concentrating our resources on improving the best structures and at the same time eliminating or abandoning existing physical structures which do not respond to current needs. Finally, in line with the general goal of promoting an improved national culture as far as defense and security issues are concerned, and in relation to the ever increasing interest in strategic and professional military issues, the transformation of the Armed Forces must also move toward gaining an improved public opinion which should foster improved communication, enhancement of the military image and appreciation of the tasks that the military performs.

## BASIC OPERATIONAL CAPABILITIES

The Basic Operational Capabilities discussed below constitute the elements that are
necessary to fully satisfy the range of missions entrusted to the Armed Forces, while
ensuring at the same time their efficiency and greatest possibility of employment. The
Basic Operational Capabilities are: C4-ISTAR, deployment and mobility (i.e. speed of
intervention and action), precision and efficacity of targeting, survival and protection of
forces, logistical sustainability and general support. These capabilities represent the
benchmark for the development of the Armed Forces and the attainment of the goals
of the transformation process that has begun.

**1. C4-ISTAR (Command, Control, Communication, Computers, “Intelligence”,**
**“Surveillance”, “Target Acquisition”, “Reconnaissance”).**

The overall capability to direct and coordinate the forces and commands engaged
in performing missions or tasks assigned to them, with the goal of enabling
Commanders at different levels, in joint and/or combined operations, to have at
their disposal a Command and Control system that is incisive, projectable,
interoperable and with a high level of survival.

**2. Deployment and Mobility.**

The capability to concentrate forces and engage them whenever and wherever
needed, rapidly, effectively and efficiently.

**3. Precision and efficacity of engagement.**

The capability to selectively engage and hit a chosen target in order to obtain the
desired effects.

**4. Survival and protection of forces.**

The capability to protect personnel and other assets necessary to carry out
assigned tasks. An adequate level of protection is reached by selecting and
adopting active and passive multilayered combined measures, with an acceptable
level of risk.

**5. Logistical sustainability.**

The capability to sustain a military force in an effective and efficient manner, in the
timeframe and locations needed, in order to ensure that the requirements
necessary to reach the various goals are met.

**6. General support.**

The capability to sustain a military force in an effective and efficient manner, in the
time frame and locations needed, ensuring that financial, legal, training and
evaluation, infrastructural and other requirements are met, so that the various goals
are reached.


21

## GENERAL REQUIREMENTS

In addition to basic operational capabilities, three General Requirements should also be
considered. Such requirements are applicable to all Services and are necessary to attain
operational capabilities in full. They are the timely availability of forces, joint integration
and combined interoperability, and interdisciplinary action.

**1. Timely availability of the forces.**

Capability to guarantee, on the basis of operational readiness levels, forces necessary
to face threats resulting from changes in the strategic environment, ensuring the
rotation of troops engaged in operations.

**2. Joint integration and combined interoperability.**

Capability of each Service to operate jointly and to integrate itself effectively into a
multinational force within a coalition or alliance.

**3. Interdisciplinary action.**

Capability to integrate each Service into a broader range of actions under the direction
of different Ministries.
