## Capable and  Sustainable

Long Term Defence Plan
17 June 2016


-----

## 1 Introduction

**Since the end of the Cold War, Norway has transformed its**
Armed Forces into a smaller, deployable and advanced force with
the equipment and training necessary to address evolving security
challenges both at home and abroad. This transition has been essential
in order to adapt the Norwegian Armed Forces to an increasingly
complex security environment.

**�������������������� being both necessary and largely successful,**
they do not fully address what we today recognise as the long-
term challenges facing Norwegian security. Further adjustments are
��������������������������������������������������������������������������
survivability and combat power to strengthen Norway and NATO’s
ability to prevent and deter the use of force.

**Years of underfunding, combined with a high operational tempo have**
also created shortfalls in training, maintenance and upgrades that are
no longer acceptable in the face of emerging challenges. These short-
falls must be addressed in order to improve capability in the near term,
and to prepare the Norwegian Armed Forces for future investments
and challenges.

**Both short-term measures to improve readiness, and long-term**
investments, are vital to ensure that Norway together with our allies
have the means necessary to resist any outside power seeking to
challenge its sovereignty and rights either through the threat, or use of
force, military or otherwise. The Norwegian Armed Forces will therefore
strengthen its ability to contribute to the defence of both Norway and
the Alliance as a whole, in order to ensure that any use of force against
Norway will carry unacceptable cost and risk.

## Norway and the Alliance


**NATO and the transatlantic security com-**
**munity remains the cornerstone of Norwegian**
security and defence policy. Norway needs
close relations with its allies. The defence of
Norway depends on the arrival of allied reinforcements before a crisis situation develops
into an armed confrontation, and on the ability
to escalate defence operations seamlessly, if
required. Facilitating greater allied presence
in Norway is important to Norwegian security.
Interoperability among allied forces and allied
presence in Norway through exercises and
���������������������������������������������
to ensure credible deterrence. Host nation
support related to such activities, along with
preparations to receive allied reinforcements,
remain a priority. These measures contribute
to the ability of Norway and its allies to ensure
a robust defence posture in peacetime, in crisis
�����������������������������������
������������������������������������������
the alliance, Norway must also maintain an
ability to respond to the early phases of a cri������������������������������������������������
tenet of the North Atlantic Treaty, which commits the member states to maintain and develop their individual and collective capacity
to resist armed attack.

with direct and indirect impact on Norwegian
and Allied security. Norwegian security and
defence policy must recognise the potential
of rapid changes in our security environment.
Domestic technological, economic and demographic trends also represent both challenges
and opportunities that must be taken into
account in the development of Norwegian
security and defence policy.

**Increasing complexity**
The international security situation, both
globally and in Norway’s immediate region,
has deteriorated since the previous Long Term
Plan was presented in 2012.
Global and regional power shifts may challenge the position of Western states in international politics. European cohesion is also
under pressure due to a combination of
demanding internal and external developments. These challenges to European and


Transatlantic security must be met with
�����������������������������������������
���������������������������������������gian security environment is Russia’s growing
military capability and its use of force. The
military reform in Russia has resulted in a
modernisation of Russia’s conventional forces as well as a strengthening of its nuclear
capabilities. The Russian annexation of Crimea
in 2014 and the continued destabilisation of
Eastern Ukraine both constitute violations of
international law, which have had a drama�������������������������������������������
repeatedly proven itself willing to use a wide
range of measures, including military force, to
����������������������������������������������
Even though Russia does not constitute a
military threat to Norway, the combination of
military modernisation and the will to exert
���������������������������������������������
as a central factor in Norwegian defence planning. Areas in Norway’s immediate vicinity are
also central to Russian nuclear deterrence,
and Russia’s military presence and activities
in the North have increased in recent years.
The High North continues to be characterised
by stability and cooperation, and Russian


strategies for the Arctic still emphasise international cooperation. At the same time, we
cannot rule out the possibility that Russia
in a given situation will consider the use of
military force to be a relevant tool, also in
the High North. Additionally, while a potential crisis is unlikely to develop in Norway’s
�������������������������������������������
������������������������������
NATO also faces serious challenges related
to developments in the Middle East, North
Africa and the Sahel. Instability caused by
economic turmoil, corruption, terror, violence
and organised crime is ultimately a threat
to international peace and security. Weak
government control may allow instability and
���������������������������������������������
��������������������������������������������
region have caused massive humanitarian suffering, destruction and a global refugee crisis.

**Technological trends and risks**
The proliferation of increasingly advanced
weapons and technologies represents a
dual challenge. On the one hand, they have
an impact on our threat environment. Such
�����������������������������������������


destructive potential, both when wielded by
national governments and non-state actors.
Long-range precision guided weapons can
������������������������������������������
warning. Modern air defence systems can
����������������������������������������������tant sections of air space. New capabilities in
the cyber and space domains likewise
create an evolving threat environment
�����������������������������������
���������������������������������
On the other hand, these technological
advancements have wide reaching economic
consequences. Countering technologically
driven risks requires continuing modernisation by even smaller forces. While new
equipment represents a qualitative improvement from the systems and platforms being
replaced, as a rule it also costs more to acquire and operate. Despite increased use of
��������������������������������������������
cooperation, increasing costs can no longer
be addressed simply by reducing the number
of platforms and units, or by internal
�����������������������������������������
be incorporated as an integral part of our
defence planning.

Addressing
the challenges

**Investing in strategic capabilities**
The Norwegian Armed Forces will continue to
provide capable and modern forces, on land, at
sea and in the air, able to address the full spec�����������������������������������������������
and maintain a number of core capabilities
����������������������������������������������tial aggressors. These strategic capabilities
������������������������������������������������
at a distance, defeat such targets if necessary
even if well defended, and survive in the face
of advanced countermeasures. When utilised
����������������������������������������������
capabilities will make a swift and determined
response possible against any use of force
against Norwegian sovereignty and rights.
One such capability is the F-35 Lightning II with
a weapons suite that includes the Norwegian-developed Joint Strike Missile. The acquisition of
up to 52 aircraft with all the necessary equipment and infrastructure will be an essential
contribution to Norwegian and Allied security.
Submarines represent another such
capability. Subject to parliamentary approval,
the Government currently plans to take delivery
of four new submarines during the latter half of
the next decade to replace the current Ula-class.
Moreover, Norway will seek to replace its
Maritime Patrol Aircraft after the ageing P-3C
Orion is withdrawn from service. A credible
defence posture relies heavily on situational awareness, intelligence and an ability to
conduct crisis management. Maritime patrol
aircraft are essential in this context, and the
Government will introduce a plan for the replacement of the P-3 Orion to the Norwegian
Parliament in due course.
��������������������������������������������
ing of Norway’s ground based air defences.
The current medium range NASAMS II system
will be upgraded, and enhanced through the
addition of extended range missiles. Additionally, new air defence systems with long-range
missiles and sensors will be introduced. Both
NASAMS II and the new long-range systems
will be concentrated around the two air ba

ses at Ørland and Evenes, and the areas that
will serve as potential staging areas for allied
reinforcements.
In addition to these four strategic investments we will also strengthen our intelligence
capabilities and make several smaller, yet equally important investments to ensure the continued modernisation of the overall joint force.

**Substantial funding increase**
Implementing these investments requires
a substantial increase in the funding for the
Norwegian Armed Forces. In total, the Government recommends additional funding over the
course of the coming 20 years of NOK 165 billion.
������������������������������������������
�������������������������������������������
����������������������������������������
future cost growth to ensure the long term
viability of the investments made.
The Government recommends a gradual increase in the defence budget over the course
of the coming four years to a 2020-level NOK
�������������������������������������������������
of this funding will address shortages in spare
parts, ammunition and maintenance that have
accumulated over the course of several years.
Following this initial phase, an additional funding increase is planned for 2021–2026 to ensure
the implementation of new investment programs necessary to meet future challenges.
In addition to the substantial funding increase, the Long Term Plan also requires a greater
����������������������������������������������
to NOK 2.5 billion by the end of 2020. This
will meet the Government’s general require������������������������������������������
in bureaucracy, and will allow funding to be
re-allocated to other high priority areas within
the defence sector.

**Continued development of the**
**Norwegian Armed Forces**
Facing future challenges requires more than
new investments and new capabilities. We
have to adjust the current structure and

**SUBMARINES** **AIR DEFENCE**

**FIGHTER AIRCRAFT** **INTELLIGENCE**


alignment of the Norwegian Armed Forces
����������������������������������������������
resources available.
The primary objective of these adjustments
is to increase the number of personnel available for operational units in order to help
improve readiness and availability. This will be
accomplished despite a net reduction in Armed
Forces personnel, as it will be accompanied by
a reduction in the number of personnel in administrative roles, or by reallocating operational personnel to high priority units.
Such measures will include increasing the
number of crews for the Navy’s frigates from
��������������������������������������������������
operation of four vessels. At the same time, the
number of mine countermeasures vessels will
��������������������������������������������������
crews, which will allow for a higher availability
of the remaining four vessels. Also, the Coastal
Ranger Command will be disbanded, with some
personnel reallocated to other units, both
within the Navy and the Army. This will also
help support the creation of a new unit within
the Army, in the form of a Ranger Company
reinforcing the Army Border Guard.


The Government will commission a Land
Power Study to provide a more in depth review
of the future mission, concept and structure
��������������������������������������������ployments during the past two decades have
proven the relevance and value of modern
land power. The Government will therefore

readiness and availability of current ground
units. Several of the key weapon systems used
by the Norwegian Army are however ageing
and in need of upgrades or replacement. This

�����������������������������������������������
the coming decades. Before proceeding with
these investments, the Government wishes to
���������������������������������������������ments over the past two decades, recent operational experience as well as Norway’s future
priorities are all taken into account. The study
will therefore review future land warfare
concepts, potential force structures, equipment, basing structure and training levels
���������������������������������������������
Norwegian ground forces as part
of the overall Norwegian defence posture.

## Closing comments

**Norwegian Minister of Defence,**
**Ms. Ine Eriksen Søreide**

**This Long Term Plan represents the culminati-**
on of a long and thorough process that has included reviews and recommendations from a
wide range of sources. Our objective has been
to develop a better understanding of where we
are, and where we need to be, and to create a
realistic and holistic plan on how to make this
a reality. We need capable and sustainable
Armed Forces in order to ensure that when we
need them the most, they have the tools, the
skills and the manpower to deliver. Developing this kind of force takes time, and history
has shown us that it is too late to begin when
the threat is already here. This is why the Norwegian Government has decided to make the
Armed Forces a priority.
