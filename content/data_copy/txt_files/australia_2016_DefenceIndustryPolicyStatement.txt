## ` Section 1 – The Defence and ` Industry Partnership

### Australia’s defence industry—our critical partner  in success

Australia’s defence industry is essential to the operations of the Australian
Defence Force (ADF) and to the capability we need to protect Australia and our
national interests.

Australia has a number of remarkable world-leading success stories in the
development of innovative Defence capability. From development of the high-end,
leading-edge phased array radar in Canberra to next-generation protected Hawkei
vehicles in Bendigo, Australian industry’s contribution is essential to building
Defence capability and ensuring Australia’s national security. Australian industry is
already making an important contribution to the development of the F-35A Lightning
II Joint Strike Fighter, and many more opportunities are on the horizon for us in that
world-leading program.

Based on the direction provided in the 2016 Defence White Paper, Defence must
deliver a significant capability modernisation program to build our future ADF. This
program will offer exciting new challenges for Australian defence industry to support
the delivery of the capability programs the ADF will need to fight and win.

In the next two decades, Australia will embark on one of the most extensive and
ambitious shipbuilding programs anywhere in the world to modernise the Royal
Australian Navy. On 4 August 2015, the Government announced continuous
shipbuilding programs for major surface combatants and minor war vessels.

Defence is also conducting a Competitive Evaluation Process for the Future
Submarine Program.

its engagement with industry and academia, simplifying access to Defence
research funding, and creating a seamless link between capability needs, smart
ideas and innovation in Australian industry.

3. **Driving competitiveness and export potential. The Government will**
maximise opportunities for competitive Australian businesses, building export
potential, depth of skills and diversification for the Australian defence industry.

4. **Cutting red tape. The Government will streamline tendering and contracting**
procedures, and rationalise the industry programs to cut red tape and make it
simpler and less costly for Australian industry to support Defence, aligned with
implementation of the First Principles Review: Creating One Defence.

This Defence Industry Policy Statement sets out the specific measures the
Government will take to implement the Defence industry policy, including:

` streamlining the numerous Defence industry and innovation programs under two `
broad initiatives funded at around $1.6 billion[1] over the decade
to FY 2025–26:

**››** establishing a new Centre for Defence Industry Capability, led by an
advisory board comprised of private sector and Defence representatives to
drive the strategic partnership with Defence, involve industry in governance
of the industry programs and provide a range of business and skilling
services. The Centre for Defence Industry Capability, and the associated
collaborative activities with Defence, will be funded at around $230 million
over the decade to FY 2025–26; and

**››** fostering a new approach to innovation through closer collaboration
between Defence, industry and research organisations to jointly develop
game-changing innovation and commercialisation opportunities. There
will be two streams of funding (described in detail in Section 3 – A New
_Approach to Defence Innovation):_

    - around $730 million (over the decade to FY 2025–26) in a Next
Generation Technologies Fund to invest in strategic technologies that
have the potential to deliver game-changing capabilities

1 All figures are calculated on an out-turned price basis.


-----

SECTION 1 – THE DEFENCE AND INDUSTRY PARTNERSHIP
## 12

            - around $640 million (over the decade to FY 2025–26) for a new Defence
Innovation Hub to undertake collaborative innovation activities from initial
concept, through prototyping and testing to introduction into service

` providing industry an earlier and stronger voice across the capability life cycle, `
including formally recognising industry as a Fundamental Input to Capability

` developing a more agile capability development and procurement process `
through implementation of the First Principles Review recommendations

` providing certainty of Government’s investment plans through publication of the `
_2016 Integrated Investment Program_

` evolving the existing Priority and Strategic Industry Capability policy into a `
Sovereign Industrial Capability Assessment Framework to ensure strategically
critical capabilities remain within Australia’s exclusive control, with an improved
system for identifying and managing these capabilities.

The initiatives in this Defence Industry Policy Statement, together with the Integrated
Investment Program, are designed to provide industry with confidence to invest in the
required skills, infrastructure and technologies to support the ADF into the future.

Our international and local industry partners will play a critical role in building the new
relationship with Defence, delivering world-class capabilities, enhancing Australian
industry skills and capabilities and investing in new innovation opportunities.

The large defence companies (the primes) will be vital in providing critical
linkages to small to medium enterprises, including potential global supply chain
opportunities. Defence and the Centre for Defence Industry Capability will also
work with the prime companies to help ensure appropriate levels of skilling and
technology transfer, and to develop effective processes for exchanging information
between Defence and local and international defence industries.

## ` Section 2 – Delivering Defence ` Capability

Through the Defence White Paper, the Government is aligning strategy, capability and
resources to build a more capable, agile and potent future force. The Government’s
capability plans for the future force, set out in the Integrated Investment Program, will
provide Defence with the ability to develop a broad range of options to respond to the
emerging challenges Australia will face in coming decades.

The Government’s commitment to Defence funding will reach two per cent of
Australia’s gross domestic product by FY 2020–21. This funding is a significant
long-term investment in Defence’s warfighting equipment and systems, research
and development, infrastructure, and the skills and training of our Defence people.

This section of the Defence Industry Policy Statement outlines the major initiatives
central to realising the Defence and industry partnership and delivering enhanced
Defence capability.

Together, these initiatives are designed to provide industry a stronger voice, improve
the transparency of Defence’s investment plans, enhance Defence’s identification
and management of sovereign industrial capabilities, and ultimately improve the
delivery of capability to Defence.

### The Centre for Defence Industry Capability

The cornerstone of the Government’s strategy for resetting the Defence-industry
partnership is the Centre for Defence Industry Capability (CDIC), which will be
co-led by private sector industry and Defence through an advisory board. The
purpose of the CDIC is to provide strategic leadership for the sector, and to help
build the capability and capacity of Australian industry to support the ADF.


-----

SECTION 2 – DELIVERING DEFENCE CAPABILITY
## 16

The CDIC will be funded at approximately $23 million per year, which will be
redirected from existing Defence industry programs funding. The CDIC is designed
to help transform the Defence and industry relationship, and to fund new industry
development, critical skilling and export programs, as well as facilitate access to
Defence's new innovation programs for small to medium enterprises.

In consultation with Government, the CDIC will drive the strategic vision for the
defence industry sector, building on the capability needs identified in the Integrated
Investment Program.

The CDIC will focus on delivering initiatives within three core activities—industry
development, facilitating innovation, and business competitiveness and exports.

#### Industry development

The CDIC will provide business advice and funding for sector-wide initiatives
that are focused on developing defence skills and solving defence issues. For
example, establishing a Defence business readiness framework to prepare small to
medium enterprises seeking to enter the complex Defence business environment.
For large-scale Defence projects, the CDIC will work with Defence to prepare and
implement industry engagement strategies that recognise the Australian industry
capabilities required for Defence.

#### Facilitating innovation

A new Defence Innovation Portal (the Portal) will be the primary conduit to introduce
Australian defence industry to Defence innovation activities. Small to medium
enterprises with innovative ideas will be able to present them to Defence through
the Portal and will be able to work with the CDIC to realise investment opportunities.
Companies will enter the Portal through business.gov.au, and then access
specialist CDIC business and innovation advisers. The Portal’s advisers will provide
information about Defence innovation requirements, prepare companies to enter the
innovation process, and ensure that company innovation proposals are suitable for
funding consideration. More information on Defence innovation is in Section 3 – A
_New Approach to Defence Innovation._


-----

Leadership and management of the CDIC
## 17

#### Business competitiveness and exports

The CDIC will have expert business advisers able to provide defence-specific
business advice to help grow prosperous Australian businesses supporting the
ADF. The CDIC will provide development support and funding to assist small to
medium enterprises improve their productivity and global competitiveness in areas
of specific interest to Defence. Building on the success of the global supply chain
program, small to medium enterprises will be able to access a range of export
programs and courses through the CDIC. More information on competitiveness and
exports is in Section 4 – Driving Competitiveness and Export Potential.

### Leadership and management of the CDIC

The CDIC will be a close collaboration between the private sector, Defence and
AusIndustry (within the Department of Industry, Innovation and Science) designed
to best meet the needs of both industry and Defence.

The CDIC will be led by an advisory board, which will be co-chaired by a senior
private sector representative and a senior executive from Defence. Board members
will comprise defence industry, Defence and other industry representative
organisations. This approach will bring together the skills and experience of
Australian defence industry leaders with senior public sector representatives to
provide clear insight into Defence’s capability requirements.

The CDIC services will be delivered through AusIndustry, allowing Defence and
industry to draw on the valuable expertise of AusIndustry’s existing service and
program delivery infrastructure. The CDIC model will build on the success of the
existing Defence Industry Innovation Centre, which will be subsumed into the
new centre.

The CDIC will employ highly qualified staff, recruited from the private and public
sectors, who possess significant industry experience and skills to provide advice
and services to industry across the country. Representatives of the CDIC will be

located in major state and territory locations, providing the flexibility to engage with
industry across Australia.

The CDIC will commence operations in the second half of 2016. This will see
the initial advisory board meetings, provision of business advisory services and
commencement of the Defence Innovation Portal.

Recognising industry as a Fundamental Input to Capability
## 19

### Recognising industry as a Fundamental Input  to Capability

Australia’s defence capability edge is based on Defence’s ability to deploy,
operate and sustain technologically superior capabilities. Defence achieves this
by acquiring advanced technology from international partners, as well as through
innovation and indigenous capability development.

For the first time, the Government will formally recognise the vital role of Australian
defence industry as a discrete Fundamental Input to Capability. The Fundamental
Inputs to Capability are those essential inputs that are combined to achieve
capability—reflecting that this requires more than simply purchasing equipment.
The current Fundamental Inputs to Capability are: personnel; organisation; collective
training; major systems; supplies; facilities and training areas; support; and
command and management.

The recognition of industry as a Fundamental Input to Capability will ensure
Defence fully considers the industrial capabilities and the capacity of Australian
businesses—micro, small, medium and large—to deliver Defence capability,
including operational capabilities and the full spectrum of support functions.

The intent behind making industry a Fundamental Input to Capability is to drive more
formal consideration of industry impacts through the early stages of the capability
development life cycle. In this way, Defence will better match the development of new
capabilities with industry’s ability to deliver them. Through this approach, Defence
can make more informed recommendations to Government on the role of industry
in the acquisition and sustainment of capability, providing more opportunities for
Australian industry and ensuring the best capability is delivered to Defence.

Defence capability managers will be required to consider and manage industry
inputs as they would other Fundamental Inputs to Capability. This means
considering the resilience and capacity of industry as capability plans are
developed—such as the reliability and health of supply chains. The CDIC will
assist capability managers to achieve this new requirement.

SECTION 2 – DELIVERING DEFENCE CAPABILITY
## 20

#### Shipbuilding—an example of industry as a Fundamental  Input to Capability

**The Government’s decision on 4 August 2015 to establish a continuous build of naval surface**
**ships is an unprecedented vote of confidence in Australia’s shipbuilding workforce and skills**
**base. It provides industry with the long-term certainty it has needed to secure investment**
**and critical skills and will foster the establishment of a new Defence and industry partnership**
**necessary to deliver this vital Australian industrial capability.**

**Constructing warships in Australia as part of a continuous building program will consolidate**
**and capitalise upon our long history of shipbuilding success. Ships acquired this way can**
**take advantage of development and experience and perform at the cutting-edge. This strategy**
**will foster a similarly advanced national ship refit and sustainment industry.**

**This new partnership will be based on a set of robust principles and reforms to allow the**
**future naval shipbuilding industry to be set up on a sustainable, long-term path.**

**_‘This (continuous shipbuilding plan) provides certainty for not just the naval shipbuilding_**
**_side of things but it also provides certainty for planning, not just within Navy, but within_**
**_the Australian Defence Force.'_**

**Vice Admiral Tim Barrett, AO, CSC, RAN, Chief of Navy, August 2015**

### The new capability development process

The Government’s First Principles Review: Creating One Defence—in particular the
reform to the capability development, acquisition and sustainment process—is
essential to implementing the Government’s plans set out in the Defence White
Paper and the Integrated Investment Program.

The Government is implementing an extensive force modernisation program that will
bring organisational and cultural opportunities and challenges. This modernisation
will introduce new capabilities that require innovative ways of working, particularly
as we integrate complex and globally networked systems into the joint force. This


-----

The new capability development process
## 21

includes establishing a single end-to-end capability development function and a
strong strategic centre with a robust contestability function.

As part of the First Principles Review, the Defence Materiel Organisation has been
dis-established and its core responsibilities for capability delivery have been
transferred to the new Capability Acquisition and Sustainment Group with clearer
responsibilities and direct lines of accountability. The new Group will work in
partnership with defence industry and, together with the CDIC, will ensure the ADF
has the necessary capabilities to fulfil its missions and operations.

The Government will revise the current process for approving new capital investment
projects to ensure tailored decision-making based on the cost, schedule, technical
complexity and overall risk of projects. Through these changes, Defence will be
able to adapt the acquisition process to the capability being sought. This will give
Defence more agility to work with industry to acquire rapidly evolving technology or
take advantage of efficiencies in less complex acquisitions.

#### Value for money in the capability development process

The Government understands the importance of the value for money concept
being clear in the context of Defence capability procurement. The Commonwealth
Procurement Rules and Defence procurement policy require procurement officers
to take into account a range of issues in considering value for money, including
financial and non-financial costs and the quality of goods and services.

Defence capability decisions will continue to seek to achieve the best value for
money, based on the Commonwealth Procurement Rules, and include explicit
consideration of:

` the sovereign requirements for Australian industry involvement, which would `
help guarantee the ADF’s independence of action

` the identification of opportunities to maximise internationally competitive `
Australian industry involvement.


-----

In considering Defence capability proposals, the Government will
ensure Defence provides comprehensive information in relation to
Australian industry issues to ensure informed decisions are made
based on the evidence presented.

### The Integrated Investment Program

The Government recognises that developing world-leading
capabilities is a long-term proposition and is confident Australian
industry will invest to meet Defence requirements where there is
additional certainty of the Government’s plans.

For the first time, the Government has released an integrated
investment program as part of the Defence White Paper package.
The Integrated Investment Program brings together all major
elements of future investment in Defence capability—from
specialist military equipment, through to Defence estate and
infrastructure, information and communications technology, and
the workforce—to create a comprehensive investment program
for Defence. It provides Australian industry with greater certainty
on the timing and sequencing of planned approvals to better
inform industry planning and guide industry investment.

An integrated approach to investment planning will ensure that key
enablers of Defence capability such as wharves, airfields, bases,
training ranges, information and communications technology, and a
trained uniformed and civilian workforce, are accorded appropriate
priority in investment decisions to maximise the effectiveness and
sustainability of the force within available resources.

the capabilities.

A Defence Industrial Capability Plan will be created that identifies
the sovereign industrial capabilities that are required to be
maintained and supported in Australia. Existing contracts and
programs that support priority and strategic industry capabilities
will continue until a transition takes place to the new sovereign
industrial capabilities, scheduled for the second quarter of 2017.

#### Plan Jericho—setting standards in industry planning and engagement

**In early 2015, the Royal Australian Air Force launched Plan Jericho—a plan to transform the**
**Air Force into a more balanced, potent and fully integrated force capable of fighting and winning**
**in the information age.**

**Together with the complementary initiatives in Army (Plan Beersheba) and Navy (Plan**
**Pelorus), Plan Jericho aims to provide a transformational shift in how Defence as a whole**
**organisation manages strategic planning, creating a culture that values innovative thought**
**and a framework that allows for the flexibility to adapt plans as required.**

**Industry is fundamental to meet the challenges within Plan Jericho, with Air Marshal Davies,**
**the Chief of Air Force including Defence’s relationship with industry as a key pillar fundamental**
**to ensuring the success of Plan Jericho:**

**_‘Plan Jericho is more than just a vision; it is about transforming our entire force …_**
**_transforming the way we think; transforming the way we operate; and transforming our_**
**_relationships with industry.’_**

**Air Marshal Leo Davies, AO, CSC, Chief of Air Force, August 2015**

The following criteria, applied collectively, will form the basis of the Sovereign
Industrial Capability Assessment Framework:

` protection of intent`

` independence of action`

` assurance of supply`

` essential skills retention`

` interoperability limits and benefits`

` leveraging competitive advantage.`

The concept of a sovereign industrial capability does not mean that all industrial
elements must be wholly maintained within government or Defence. Defence
envisages that the number of sovereign industrial capabilities will be small, properly

targeted and managed. Key examples could include the industrial capabilities
underpinning the Nulka active missile decoy system and the CEA phased array radar.

This new framework will be designed to operate at two levels in Defence:

` at the strategic level, Defence will provide an improved identification and `
management plan for sovereign industrial capabilities

` at the individual project investment level, Defence will provide recommendations `
to Government on sovereign industrial capabilities as part of the Government’s
consideration of discrete capital investment proposals.

### Key enablers that support Defence capability

Defence recognises the importance of a balanced and integrated approach to
investment in new capability and the key enablers—such as wharves, airfields,
bases, training ranges, information and communications technology, and a trained
uniformed and civilian workforce. The 2016 Defence Industry Policy Statement is
aimed at addressing all capabilities of industry, including the key enablers that
support Defence.

The Integrated Investment Program outlines an investment of around $195 billion
in Defence capability, approximately 25 per cent of which will be spent on key
enablers. The large majority of the key enablers investment will be spent in
Australia. Defence procurement of these capabilities and services, which includes
non-materiel procurement, is extensive in diversity, value, geographical spread and
the number of suppliers involved directly or indirectly through the supply chain.

The Integrated Investment Program, in accordance with the plans set out in the
Defence White Paper, places a high priority on investment in the following specific
key enablers:

` developing and maintaining critical infrastructure—including airfields, wharves, `
port facilities, key ADF bases and logistics systems such as fuel and explosive
ordnance facilities

` upgrading training and weapons ranges to support advanced weapons and `
systems


-----

SECTION 2 – DELIVERING DEFENCE CAPABILITY
## 26

` providing testing facilities and modern health services that enable ADF training `
and exercises—including jointly with the United States and others

` investing in information and communications technology that supports Defence `
business, from peacetime activities through to combat operations.

Future Defence procurement in these areas will focus on the development of
strategic partnerships with industry to ensure agile delivery, improved data,
management of risks and innovation through longer-term commitments creating
stronger, sustained local skill and expertise.

##### Future options for Defence

Building new Defence owned fuel infrastructure to replace or expand existing
facilities may not always be the preferred or value for money solution for
Defence. Likewise, preserving the current operating and maintenance model
for fuel infrastructure may not always be the best solution. A new approach is
needed. First and foremost, Defence will continue to need access to a secure
and resilient fuel supply chain that provides the right fuels to a flexible number
of locations in scalable volumes to meet capability needs, in a safe, efficient
and cost effective manner. Solutions to meet this requirement are potentially
very different from the traditional Defence design, build and operate approach.
Defence needs to be a smart buyer.

##### An improved fuels network for Defence capability

Defence is already engaging with industry to identify how to deliver improved
fuel network resilience, safety and cost. A consolidated picture of demand
covering supply for regular training and operations, as well as increased
demand for contingency scenarios, has been developed and shared with
industry to enable collaboration and co-design of new fuel supply options.
Defence has commenced the use of industry facilities rather than building and
operating parallel infrastructure. Recently, in Darwin, rather than investing tens
of millions of dollars to replace aged infrastructure, Defence has partnered
with industry to provide a more flexible and cost effective solution to supply
fuel to Navy. This includes using commercial rather than military specific fuel
to take full advantage of the industry supply chain. Similar considerations are
occurring in other parts of the Defence fuel supply chain wherever feasible,
however one size may not fit all.

Defence stands to gain significant benefits through collaborating with industry
to enhance the fuel supply chain—increasing resilience and reducing cost
and risk.

## ` Section 3 – A New Approach to ` Defence Innovation

Driving Australian innovation is a critical element of the Government’s vision for
the nation. The Government’s National Innovation and Science Agenda released
on 7 December 2015 will incentivise and reward innovation, entrepreneurship and
risk taking.

Defence’s new approach to innovation, described in this section, complements
the Government’s broader strategy. The increasing pace of geopolitical, economic
and technological change means it is critical that Defence ensure it has continued
access to the best innovation Australia has to offer.

Investment in innovation helps to ensure Defence remains resilient to emerging
threats, including the possible use of disruptive technologies by adversaries. It also
enables us to take advantage of new or developing areas of technology that have the
potential to provide a capability edge for Australia’s relatively small force.

Australia benefits from an industrial base consisting of a large number of agile small
to medium enterprises strengthened by a vital collection of global companies—with
access to global knowledge networks, supply chains networks and export markets.

Together our small, medium and large enterprises (along with Australian research
institutions and academics) have a track record of producing some of the world’s
most innovative defence technologies. However, these enterprises have often
found it difficult to engage with Defence due to the fragmented nature of innovation
programs and complex entry processes.

The Government is committed to implementing a new approach to Defence
innovation that will address these barriers and more effectively access the potential
of Australian defence industry to innovate. This new approach will provide greater
transparency of Defence needs, seed and nurture innovative technologies and the
companies developing them, and develop regulatory and cultural processes to
facilitate innovation.

### Next Generation Technologies Fund—Defence’s strategic research

Effective leveraging of science and technology is a significant priority for Defence,
given the relatively small size of the Defence and the wide range of operations it
must be able to conduct.

History has shown that the most game-changing military capabilities arise from the
pursuit of next generation research and technology programs. In Australia, Defence
and Australian industry have developed the internationally acclaimed Jindalee
operational radar network, the Nulka anti-ship-missile decoy and world-class
counter-improvised explosive device systems.

The Government recognises the importance that Defence’s strategic research has
for Australia’s future prosperity, both as a nation and in the global market. Through
the Integrated Investment Program, the Government will invest around $730 million
(over the decade) in new funding to better position Defence to respond to strategic

## 32

challenges and develop the next generation game-changing capabilities of the
future. The Defence Science and Technology Group (DST Group) will take the lead
role in conducting and integrating research in next generation technologies.

The investment priorities for the Next Generation Technologies Fund will be
generated via a rigorous but agile process that is regularly reviewed and agreed by
Defence's Investment Committee. DST Group will work with Defence stakeholders,
industry, academia and allied defence research agencies on technology studies to
identify opportunities and potential game-changing technology areas.

Examples of priority areas of work for the Next Generation Technologies Fund, as
identified in the Integrated Investment Program, include:

` integrated intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance`

` space capabilities`

` enhanced human performance`

` medical countermeasure products`

` multidisciplinary material sciences`

` quantum technologies`

` trusted autonomous systems`

` cyber`

` advanced sensors, hypersonics, and directed energy capabilities.`

DST Group will participate in the Defence Innovation Forums (discussed below)
to communicate the Next Generation Technologies Fund priorities, explain how
industry and academia can partner with Defence on the programs, and present
progress on existing activities.

Defence will build collaborative programs with academia, publicly funded research
agencies, industry (particularly small to medium enterprises), and our allies to
create a vibrant and interlocking research and innovation capability that is focused
on driving Defence outcomes.


-----

Next Generation Technologies Fund—Defence’s strategic research
## 33

Defence will work closely with Government and industry bodies across Australia
which are participating in innovation activities. This will provide greater
opportunities for collaboration and leverage the substantial national investment in
research and development.

For example, Defence will co-invest in Cooperative Research Centres and Australian
Research Council Industry Linkage Programs and continue its support for the
national science, technology, engineering and mathematics initiatives.

Defence's Investment Committee will have oversight of the Next Generation
Technologies Fund. When promising science and technologies have reached a
suitable level of maturity, the Investment Committee may approve the project’s
transition to the Defence Innovation Hub for the provision of further funding to allow
these technologies to develop into operational capabilities.

The Panorama software is the result of a development process in which
experimental versions were deployed on Royal Australian Navy surface
combatants and operator feedback was used to iteratively evolve the design.
The Panorama software has been licensed to Thales Australia which has
equipped the Adelaide Class frigates with Panorama to supplement the existing
underwater warfare system. With the assistance of existing Defence industry
innovation support funding, including the Capability Technology Demonstrator
program and the Defence Innovation Realisation Fund, Thales Australia has also
integrated the Panorama software into an upgrade of its Spherion sonar system,
providing a substantial improvement in capability for Navy’s Anzac Class ships.


### The Defence Innovation Hub—turning research  into capability

The new Defence Innovation Hub will be established as a virtual organisation in the
second half of 2016 and will manage a portfolio of Defence innovation investments.
The Hub will be coordinated from the Defence Strategic Policy and Intelligence
Group, and will rationalise and simplify the existing Defence innovation programs
into a streamlined program which nurtures and matures proposals through a single
innovation pipeline. Funding of around $640 million (over the decade to FY 2025–26)
will be redirected from the existing innovation programs to more effectively deliver
innovation to Defence.

The portfolio of investments will range from small ‘concept’ exploration projects
through to large-scale prototypes, and will introduce innovation solutions across
the Defence enterprise—including information and communications technology
and intelligence capabilities. The Hub will have a strong virtual presence across the
nation, working closely with industry, academic and research institutions, using the
networks established by Defence and the CDIC. The Hub will be responsible for:

` clearly articulating Defence capability needs and challenges`

` requesting proposals from industry and academia for innovative capabilities`


-----

The Defence Innovation Hub—turning research into capability
## 35

` providing the Investment Committee with recommendations on funding priorities `
for innovation activities

` building collaborative programs with Defence stakeholders and contract `
management for innovation activities, including supporting the testing and
assessment of innovation projects

` championing innovation across Defence.`

The virtual Hub will assist Australian companies, and academic and research
organisations to assess whether innovations have a Defence application and will
provide access to funding to collaboratively mature those ideas. It will be informed
by Defence capability priorities identified in the force design process.

The investment of around $640 million over the decade to FY 2025–26, will
be directed to Defence’s highest priority capability needs, including urgent
operationally driven requirements. Decisions on investment will be based on
evidence from operational and technical experts. Defence will consider, prioritise
and resource innovation proposals based on alignment with Defence strategy and:

` suitability—to fulfil a priority Defence capability, enterprise or `
technology challenge

` feasibility—from a technology perspective`

` timeliness—ability to deliver capability when it is needed.`

Critical to the success of the Hub will be the development of the supporting policies
and culture to remove the current barriers in Defence to innovation. New contracting
and intellectual property regimes will be established to maximise incentives to
innovation and attract investment from a range of local and international sources.
Importantly, Defence will develop new approaches to risk, to encourage Defence
and industry to embrace risk where necessary to allow innovation to flourish across
the Defence enterprise.

Prior to the establishment of the Hub in the second half of 2016, Defence will
release more information to industry on the detailed operation of the Hub, including
business processes and performance metrics such as expected timeframes for
responses to proposals.


-----

The Defence Innovation Portal—stakeholder engagement and facilitation
## 37

### The Defence Innovation Portal—stakeholder engagement and facilitation

To help drive the new approach to Defence innovation, the Government will establish
a Defence Innovation Portal within the CDIC to ensure we achieve expansive and
effective communications into the Australian academic and industrial base.

The Portal will provide a key communication bridge between Defence, industry and
academia and will be the entry point for ‘new starters’ to engage with Defence’s
virtual Innovation Hub. In particular, small to medium enterprises that do not
have established Defence relationships will be able to use the Portal to gain
an understanding of Defence’s capability needs and to support their ability to
contribute to Defence’s requirements.

The Portal will:

` broadcast Defence’s capability and technology challenges, including the Next `
Generation Technologies Fund, through the business.gov.au online service, as
well as through networking and engagement processes

` refer and connect companies via the Portal’s expert innovation advisers to key `
Defence research and innovation priorities

` convene regular Defence Innovation Forums where Defence will engage with `
industry, academic and research organisations

` help to facilitate early engagement with the Defence Export Controls Branch in `
Defence via the strong connections between Defence and the Portal’s business
advisers

` assist in developing viable innovation proposals for consideration by the Hub `
through expert innovation advice

` introduce industry to broader Government innovation initiatives through `
AusIndustry’s connections in the Department of Industry, Innovation
and Science.

##### Industry engagement

Australian defence industry was engaged early in the project, through Defence’s
Australian Military Sales Office (AMSO), in order to facilitate a rapid transition
of the prototypes into full manufacturing and subsequent production of
the GREENGUM and GREYGUM systems. Five Australian small to medium
enterprises were selected and subsequently contracted to participate in the
program to meet the demanding schedule. Thanks to the exceptional efforts
of these industry partners, Australia was able to begin delivery to Afghanistan
of the first of over 100,000 systems within four months of contract signatures.
Based on the demonstrated effectiveness of these fielded solutions, AMSO staff
in December 2015 successfully negotiated the sale of a further 55,000 systems
to Afghanistan.

##### A new approach to innovation

The counter IED systems delivered under the Redwing Program are a clear
illustration of the successful collaboration between Defence and industry to
rapidly develop, manufacture and deliver cutting-edge technologies in response
to an urgent operational requirement.

This is an exemplar of how the new approach to innovation will function. In
particular, it will:

` leverage forward-looking research in key areas offering high impact `
to Defence

` involve close interactions with operational users`

` provide a strong link from the capability need to potential solutions`

` include early involvement of Australian defence industry to rapidly transition `
innovations into fielded capabilities.

The business initially requested assistance through business.gov.au where the
company’s potential and the significance of its technology for both commercial
and Defence applications was recognised and it was agreed to pursue parallel
and complementary paths of assistance for the company. The following worked
together to assist the company; AusIndustry, the Defence Industry Innovation
Centre, the Defence Global Supply Chain Program and Business Access Office,
and AusTrade.

The iWebGate story and journey is far from over and the company continues to
receive strong and ongoing support from Government as it enters into a new
and perhaps even more challenging stage of business growth and international
commercialisation challenges.

Importantly, the iWebGate success story is now in turn building further
opportunities for Australian companies as it collaborates with other innovative
Australian businesses to provide further innovation and development of
business and government critical information security solutions.


### The importance of industry skilling and STEM— Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics

The Government is committed to a long-term national strategy which harnesses
innovation to improve productivity and competitiveness. A key component of
this strategy is building the nation’s science, technology, engineering and
mathematics skills.

For Australia to develop and maintain a technologically advanced and agile defence
industry sector it must be populated by personnel with advanced education, training
and experience. Having the right levels of training and skills in Australia’s defence
industry is essential for the efficient delivery and sustainment of increasingly
complex Defence capability.


-----

The importance of industry skilling and STEM—Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics
## 47

The Government recognises that managing a business within the defence
environment has some unique challenges that require enhanced commercial,
managerial and technical skills. In partnership with other government services,
Defence and the CDIC will assist Australian defence industry to access the most
suitable training programs from a whole-of-government perspective.

The CDIC will identify the most appropriate source of support, and depending on the
circumstances, the CDIC will:

` direct businesses that need to develop general business skills to the Industry `
Skills Fund

` develop and fund tailored individual training through the CDIC`

` develop and fund joint industry and defence training activities, particularly where `
specialist defence business skills are identified.

An important task for the CDIC, in consultation with Defence and industry, will be
to conduct a skills gap analysis by sector to help ensure Australia has the skills
needed to meet the requirements of existing and future capabilities.

#### Science, technology, engineering and mathematics skills

Improving Australia’s already world-class education system is part of the
Government’s long-term strategy to secure the high-tech industrial investment
necessary to position Australia as an advanced economy of the twenty-first century.
Central to this pursuit is the Government’s strong commitment to increasing the
focus on science, technology, engineering and mathematics in schools to train the
scientists, engineers and innovative thinkers of tomorrow.

As part of the National Innovation and Science Agenda, the Government is
providing additional support to foster school students’ interest and competency in
science, technology, engineering and mathematics to better equip students with
job-relevant skills. Specifically, the Agenda promotes support for all Australian
students to embrace the digital age by promoting coding and computing in schools
to ensure our students have the problem-solving and critical reasoning skills for


-----

SECTION 4 – DRIVING COMPETITIVENESS AND EXPORT POTENTIAL
## 48

high wage jobs. Changes are also being made to the visa system to attract more
entrepreneurial and research talent from overseas.

In recognition of the critical importance of science, technology, engineering and
mathematics skills to Defence capability, Defence is:

` supporting ADF recruitment by reintroducing the Defence Technical `
Scholarships program for year 11 and 12 students

` providing a career pathway in Defence for science and technology professionals `
by establishing Australian Public Service cadetships.

Defence also has a number of existing science, technology, engineering and
mathematics programs designed to boost these skills within the Australian defence
industry, including the Defence Engineering Internship Program and the School
Pathways Programs.

These programs will continue to be funded in FY 2016–17. The CDIC’s advisory
board will review those programs and make recommendations to the Government
about the best way to progress essential science, technology, engineering and
mathematics initiatives starting in FY 2017–18.

Future initiatives will target and directly contribute to the development of Defence
capability, which will also enhance the science, technology, engineering and
mathematics skills available to the broader Australian economy. Details of these
programs are in Attachment A – Program Information for Key Initiatives.

### A stronger Australian Industry Capability Program

The Australian Industry Capability Program requires companies looking to supply
and support capability to Defence, in projects valued at over $20 million, to submit
an Australian Industry Capability Plan. The Plan details:

` how the company has engaged with Australian industry to identify Australian `
companies capable of being part of the supply chain


-----

A stronger Australian Industry Capability Program
## 49

` how the competitive source selection decisions were made in relation to the `
proposed subcontractors

` how the company intends to support the transfer of technology and foster `
innovation within Australian industry.

Defence evaluates the Australian Industry Capability Plans based on the quality
of the proposals and benefit to Australian industry. Once in contract, Defence will
enforce the contracted Australian Industry Capability Plan to ensure the benefits
are realised.

The Government is committed to building a stronger Australian Industry Capability
Program as an important part of developing a strengthened Australian industry
development process. The $20 million threshold will be maintained and Defence
will work with the CDIC to build on this program, looking for synergies with the
Global Supply Chain Program (discussed below). These two programs are seen as
complementary, working with the same supplier base in Australia.

To realise the full potential of the Australian Industry Capability Program, Defence
will ensure that:

` Defence and industry continue to build their knowledge and understanding of `
relevant Defence and Government policy and legislative responsibilities

` Defence provides effective management and assurance of Australian Industry `
Capability Plans to appropriately support sovereign industrial capabilities, obtain
contracted capability and the realisation of other industry benefits

` prime companies continue to receive assistance in the construction and `
implementation of their Australian Industry Capability Plans.

Defence industry, particularly prime companies, will have a critical part to play
in enabling capable and competitive Australian companies gain access to supply

### Building on the success of the Global Supply  Chain Program

The Global Supply Chain Program involves working with multinational defence
companies to identify opportunities for Australian companies within their
international supply chains.

Six prime companies are involved in the program and are identifying bid
opportunities for Australian industry across both civilian and military aspects of
the business. The prime companies involved are: BAE Systems; Boeing; Lockheed
Martin; Northrop Grumman; Raytheon; and Thales. To date, over 1,000 commercial
opportunities have been provided to Australian industry under the Global Supply
Chain Program and in excess of 115 Australian companies have won over 700
contracts together worth over $755 million.

To build on the effectiveness of this program, the CDIC will support the Global
Supply Chain Program so that all elements of defence industry support are aligned
under a common strategy and leadership arrangement, maximising supply chain
opportunities.

Defence has recently developed a new performance framework to provide greater
assurance of the program’s achievements to increase competitiveness, innovation
and productivity of Australian industry. Defence and the CDIC will continue to
build on these improvements, working with industry to maximise opportunities
for local businesses.

Defence and the CDIC may seek additional funding from specific Defence projects
where a global supply chain arrangement with the winning tenderer has the potential
to provide capable Australian companies with significant export opportunities.

In September 2015, Ocius was awarded a $3 million contract through one
of Defence’s industry innovation support programs – the CTD program. The
contract was to develop and demonstrate an Unmanned Surface Vessel,
coupled with a thin-line towed array system uniquely suited for anti-submarine
warfare surveillance.

In addition to being awarded CTD funding, Ocius recently won the award of
‘Best Advanced Manufacturing Company’ at the 2015 Australian Technology
Competition.

This award recognises the company’s innovative and commercial approach to
business which has included taking advantage of Government programs to help
drive efficiencies and pursue exports.

The DIIC is continuing to work with Ocius to improve its export readiness to
pursue overseas defence opportunities in conjunction with Australian defence
opportunities.

Maximising opportunities for Australian defence industry in the global
sustainment system for the Joint Strike Fighter will require an even closer
relationship between industry and Defence in the future.

The global supply chain opportunities, provided to Australian defence industry
through the Joint Strike Fighter Program, are a good example of how largescale capability projects can provide real benefit and growth to Australian
small to medium enterprises. Defence will, in collaboration with CDIC, seek to
develop similar models for Australian industry involvement in future major ADF
capability projects. Figure 4 shows Australian industry involvement in the Joint
Strike Fighter Program as at December 2015.

### Direct support from Team Defence Australia for Australian industry exports

There can be no higher praise for Australian-developed defence equipment than that
given by the men and women of the ADF who have used the capabilities in both peace
and wartime. Potential international customers place significant weight in procuring
capability that has been tested in operational service.

SECTION 4 – DRIVING COMPETITIVENESS AND EXPORT POTENTIAL
## 56

To ensure this message is heard by potential international customers, the
Government will continue to promote Australian defence industry exports by using
former two and three-star ADF officers as Team Defence Australia representatives at
international trade shows.

The Team Defence Australia initiative will be improved by integrating it within
the CDIC. This will enable targeted, focused promotion of products prioritised to
Defence’s capability needs, which will maximise the potential for export growth.

### Working with the Defence Export Controls Branch

Within Australia’s system of export controls, the Defence Export Controls Branch is
responsible for regulating the export of defence and strategic goods, services and
technologies.

Export controls ensure that goods and technologies that can be used for military
purposes, or to develop weapons of mass destruction, do not get into the wrong
hands. It is important that this can be achieved without disrupting legitimate trade,
innovation and international scientific collaboration.

The implementation of strengthened export controls under the Defence Trade
_Controls Act 2012 requires close engagement with industry and academic_
stakeholders to ensure that these new controls are understood and practicable.
In consultation with stakeholders, the Defence Export Controls Branch, within the
Department of Defence, has introduced reforms for a more streamlined, risk-based
approach to export controls that provides a leaner and more responsive export
control system.

The reforms include the introduction of:

` an online permit system that has streamlined the application process and `
reduced processing times for export permits


-----

Working with the Defence Export Controls Branch
## 57

` risk-based approaches, such as:`

– broader export licences for lower-risk items going to lower-risk destinations

– longer licences for lower-risk exports enabling greater self-assessment
by exporters of the control status of their goods through an online
assessment tool.

The Government recognises that Australian companies producing sensitive
technologies in service with the ADF have at times raised concerns about
restrictions on the export of their products. To help companies in this situation,
Defence has established a Sensitive Technologies Advisory Group to:

` identify sensitive Australian-produced technologies that are in service with the `
ADF and therefore need to be protected

` work with the producers of these technologies on the exportability of their `
products, so that they can make reasoned commercial decisions or develop
variants early in the capability development life cycle

` harness opportunities to use exports and the disposal of equipment being retired `
from service with the ADF to pursue international engagement objectives.

_The Australia–United States Defence Trade Cooperation Treaty is in place to_
enable opportunities for Australian companies to export their products. It provides
Australian defence industry with opportunities to import, export, transfer or
re-export eligible defence articles that support Australian or United States
government defence projects, military exercises, cooperative programs and
equipment sustainment, without the need for individual licences or authorisations.

The Treaty framework may also benefit Australian defence industry by opening new
avenues for industrial cooperation and allowing partnering and technology sharing
with their United States counterparts, and by reducing lead times in brokering
business opportunities and responding to requests for tender.

A. W. Bell has received continued support, stemming from the business review
conducted by the DIIC, and also been given the opportunity to partner with
other government agencies. This work has ensured that it has been able to
create a transformational business vision and implement dramatic process and
product improvement—giving them an edge over their global competitors.

This type of 'strategic supplier development' is a key part of establishing
industry as a Fundamental Input to Capability and is expected to become
normal practice for Defence and the CDIC.

## ` Section 5 – Doing Business with ` Defence: Cutting Red Tape

The initiatives outlined in this Statement reflect Government’s commitment to
removing inefficient and ineffective regulation. Through the new Centre for Defence
Industry Capability (CDIC) and the Defence Innovation Hub, Defence will adopt
more efficient processes for engaging with industry, including streamlined and
tailored administrative processes for investing in innovation, greater collaboration
with the states and territories on industry programs and a shift towards a more
forward-leaning and productivity-focused culture.

The Government has also accepted the recommendations of the First Principles
Review to transform the business environment for individuals and companies
working with Defence to lower tendering and contracting costs, and reduce red tape.

This section details the specific initiatives Defence will undertake to meet the
Government objective of improving the way Defence does business, including by
removing any unnecessary regulation, and improving procurement practices across
the Defence enterprise.

### Implementing the First Principles Review:  Creating One Defence—Defence as a smart buyer

The First Principles Review established a strong case for organisational change
and to Defence’s approach to interacting with industry. The First Principles Review
was critical of the current ‘one size fits all’ approach to procurement strategy as it
inhibits strategic engagement with industry.

The establishment of a single end-to-end capability development function will
improve Defence’s interactions with industry, removing complex and unnecessary
procurement processes, and Defence will:


-----

SECTION 5 – DOING BUSINESS WITH DEFENCE: CUTTING RED TAPE
## 62

` move to a leaner ‘smart buyer’ model that better manages risk, leverages `
industry, is simpler, more commercially oriented and delivers value for money.
This will involve significant streamlining to remove unnecessarily complex
components of the Government's approach, tendering and contracting processes
in Defence; and

` strengthen the initial stages of the capability development life cycle by revising `
the two pass process, establishing an entry gate and creating a clear pathway to
tailor and fast track projects. The strategy will also include a robust and armslength contestability process. These reforms will provide industry with increased
confidence in project schedules and reduce the potential for schedule delays.

### Defence’s commitment to the regulatory  reform agenda

Defence is strongly committed to the Government’s regulatory reform agenda.
Establishing more effective and efficient methods of working with industry is critical
to Defence’s ability to harness innovation and to ensure an agile and collaborative
approach with industry.

Defence is taking action to identify, assess and ensure we are playing our part in
lowering costs for business. Since Defence began implementing the regulatory
reform agenda, we have already identified Defence and industry savings of over
$40 million. Key initiatives that have been identified include:

` improving selection of templates for the Australian Standard for Defence `
Contracting

` simplifying the Australian Standard for Defence Support template for major `
platform sustainment

` standardising the approach to performance based contracting in the sustainment `
of Defence materiel

` introducing e-tendering`


-----

Defence’s commitment to the regulatory reform agenda
## 63

` amending the` _Defence Trade Controls Act 2012 to reduce export regulation for_
industry, university and research stakeholders

` streamlining intellectual property management`

` introducing open days for small to medium sized business enterprise `
engagement.

Defence will continue to implement these initiatives and identify new opportunities
to reduce the cost and impost on businesses of regulatory measures. For Australian
companies, this means it will be easier for them to compete for and win Defence
business.

Through this Defence Industry Policy Statement, the Government is also making
significant reductions in red tape associated with industry and innovation programs,
fundamentally reshaping the way industry engages with Defence. The streamlining
of Defence industry and innovation programs into the Defence Innovation Hub and
the CDIC will make it simpler and cheaper for business to engage with Defence.

Streamlining the Defence industry programs will allow Defence and industry to:

` ensure industry development and skilling needs are accurately identified `
and targeted

` align industry development activities with the Integrated Investment Program`

` reduce red tape and administrative burden through simplifying entry into `
industry development and innovation programs

` develop a program of regular reviews to ensure the effectiveness and return on `
investment of industry development activities and outcomes.

Defence is committed to driving innovation and making it easier for individuals and
businesses to access Australian Government services through the Government’s
_Digital Transformation Agenda. The CDIC will draw on AusIndustry’s whole-_
of-government service delivery solutions, which have been established to be
consistent with the Digital Transformation Agenda. By using these services Defence
will ensure the CDIC consistently provides high quality services and helps to satisfy
industry needs.

#### Case Study Key Enablers—Indigenous Procurement

Defence is leading the way in innovative procurement strategies to help provide
opportunities for Indigenous Australians to participate in the economy. In 2014
there were milestone procurement decisions of significant contracts awarded
to Pacific Services Group Holdings, including a managing contract for the
planning phase of the Garden Island Stage 1 Cruiser Wharf Upgrade. Defence
is actively engaged with a number of other indigenous contractors and will
be working with them towards the targets of the Commonwealth Indigenous
Procurement Policies.

### Working with the states, territories and other stakeholders on defence industry matters

Delivering Defence capability involves many stakeholders at the Australian
Government and state and territory levels. There is much that can be done to
establish a more coordinated approach between these jurisdictions to help grow
Australian defence industry and present a united position to overseas markets.

Defence will take a lead role, supported by the CDIC, to deliver the required level of
coordination. Particular areas of focus for this coordination effort will be:

` recommending opportunities for improvement for better coordination through `
the CDIC

` recommending strategies to rationalise funded programs between federal, `
state and territory governments to deliver integrated enterprise development,
workforce skilling, and innovation support for new and established defence
companies. Defence will work closely with state industry development and
education departments in this context


-----

SECTION 5 – DOING BUSINESS WITH DEFENCE: CUTTING RED TAPE
## 66

` coordinating efforts to increase Australian supply chain capability and `
competitiveness. This should also involve coordinating Defence and state and
territory activities in trade shows, related industry events and communication
strategies

` coordinating efforts in relation to export opportunities with AusTrade and the `
Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, as well as the states and territories

` coordinating Australian defence technology development opportunities, `
particularly leveraging the Innovation Portal in the CDIC

` coordinating the collection of timely industry data and statistics across the `
nation to standardise methodologies and comparisons of defence industry
performance. This will involve leveraging the proximity and visibility afforded
by state and territory based defence industry development agencies to assist
Defence in maintaining an up-to-date view of current and emerging capabilities.

A key objective will be to ensure that Defence coordinates a national approach
adopted by all stakeholders in a united effort to deliver Defence capability and grow
our Australian industrial base.

Industry has increased opportunities to improve its value proposition to Defence
by using the greater economies of scale available through this strategic
contracting framework and by developing solutions armed with a greater
understanding of Defence requirements and a reduced administrative burden
delivered through simplified contracts.

Further reform within the Estate Works element of the Base Services model is
delivering real benefits to Defence and industry through:

` grouping like projects, and delivering and managing them nationally to `
reduce the management costs; and

` rolling out a model for the delivery of general estate works where the `
contractor has a fixed budget responsibility, rather than tendering for
each job.

##### The future for Defence contracting

Defence will continue to review and build on reform, including its relationship
with industry. The Base Services model will be adapted across a broader range
of services and procurement to provide greater value for money to Defence and
reduce the cost to industry of competing for service delivery.

Further consolidation of service delivery will occur; for example, individual
regional base service contracts will be rolled into the national base services
contracts where appropriate.
