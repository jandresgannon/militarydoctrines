REQUIREMENTS


In 2013 the 95 regulatory legal acts were endorsed, including 9 Laws of Ukraine, 19
Decrees of the President of Ukraine, 34 decrees and 33 regulations of the Cabinet of
Ministers of Ukraine (Annex 1). These documents allowed to:

  - improve basis of the state policy in the defence area and technical refurbishment

of the Armed Forces;

  - expand the boundaries of the Armed Forces participation in international

operations on maintaining peace and security and to set cooperation with
individual countries, continue constructive partnership within the framework of
international cooperation;

  - increase the credibility and competitive ability of the military service at the

labour market through the gradual increase of allowance for military personnel
within two years and regulate the payment of compensation allowance for
housing renting from January 1, 2014.


The State Budget of Ukraine for 2013 allocated UAH
**15,281.2 million for the Ministry of Defence, which**
accounted for 0.97% of GDP. The General Fund
amounted to UAH 14,300.1 million (93.6% of the
budget) while the Special Fund accounted for UAH
981.1 million (6.4% of the budget).
Only **UAH 15,160.2 million (0.96% of GDP) was**
actually allocated which accounted for 99.2% of the
annual budget. The General Fund allocation totalled
UAH 14,300.1 million (100% of the budget) and the
Special Fund – UAH 860.1 million (87.7% of the budget)
(Diagram 1.1).

According to the planned indexes the underfunding amounted for

UAH 121.0 million (Annex 2).
At the same time UAH 8 million were allocated from the Reserve

Fund for the troops (forces) needs[1].
The preliminary monitoring of financial transactions and contracts

audit was introduced, and anti-corruption analysis of the risk areas of
the Armed Forces functioning was conducted in order to exclude the
corruption component in the Ministry of Defence. As a result of the
measures taken and the introduction of additional control mechanisms to
prevent inefficient administrative decisions in 2013, significant resources
for the Armed Forces reform were retained. In general the loss of UAH
106 million was averted, unreasonable use of UAH 24 million was
prevented and more than UAH 58 million were reimbursed.

in 2013, which guaranteed the receipt of funds and provided for the reality of works
performance plans.

Under these conditions over 73% of funds allocated for research and development

works were directed towards works that are at the stage of state testing, exploratory
prototype production and preliminary testing.

Management and collaboration chains at all stages of materiel life cycle was
improved in order to ensure the reality of works implementation plans:

              - • the procedure was set for the development and production of new items

(samples) of defence products to execute state defence order and discontinuation
of items, characteristics of which do not meet modern requirements or the need
to supply which is satisfied in full and their further production is not planned[5];

              - the mechanism for the development, coordination and approval of common endto-end plan for the development of item (system, complex) of materiel, military
and special equipment and its components was defined[6];

                - the procedure was specified for the transfer and return of materiel to enterprises,

institutions and organizations regardless of the form of ownership for the repair,
conversion, refurbishment, research of technical condition, special inspections
and storage[7].
In general 13 new items of materiel were put into service of the Armed Forces

during the year, namely:

               - “Stugna-P” portable antitank guided missile launcher with thermal imager;

              - “Polozhenie-2” sound ranging system of artillery guns and mortars firing

FORCES’ TRAINING
SUPPORT


The implementation of the Training Improvement Concept of the Armed Forces of
Ukraine (2012) was continued during the year. The final transition to the 2-year cycle
of forces’ training was accomplished. Commanders of military units have acquired
the authority to plan training activities and choose the most efficient and appropriate
forms and methods of military training in accordance with the allocated resources.
UAH 444.7 million was planned for the funding of forces’ training (46% of the

need). UAH 427.4 million was actually allocated, that is 96,1% of the planned amount
(Table 3.1, 3.2).
That is why the tendency to use low-cost forms of combat training, especially one

based on barracks training material resources continued. The scale of interoperability
operations with tactical level units was reduced; in particular, units below the level
“crew-squad-platoon” were mainly used.

IMPLEMENTATION
OF THE PERSONNEL
POLICY IN THE
ARMED FORCES:
SUMMARY


During 2013, the main efforts of the Ministry of Defence and the General Staff of the
Armed Forces were directed at training of motivated personnel in military service
(personnel) able to perform the assigned missions.

Improvement of personnel policy in the Armed Forces

Improvement of personnel management by means of raising the effectiveness of
personnel work was of a significant importance in order to provide the authorities
with forces (troops) and the principal direction of military C2 agencies’ activity in
2013[1].
During the year the following measures were taken:

                    - contract service accession procedure has been

simplified and regulated by the Instruction on organization
of implementation of the Regulation on the performance
of military service in the Armed Forces of Ukraine by
citizens of Ukraine[2]. At the present moment commanders
of military units have the right to enlist candidates on a
contract service and conclude contracts with them;

                    - special revision of records on those people who

apply to fill the positions of service personnel has been
implemented[3];

                    - the evaluation procedure of service personnel of the

Armed Forces has been improved and the implementation
of a new system of independent evaluation of service
personnel was launched;

                    - training of civilian personnel for the further

enlistment on contract service as enlisted and NCO personnel has been initiated
in military units. Nearly 2,000 people were prepared in this way;

  - NCO’s authorities were enlarged and responsibility was increased at the

current command and control hierarchy of the Armed Forces, in particular their
distribution among officers and sergeants (NCOs), regulated by the new Concept

on the development of professional non-commissioned officers of the Armed
Forces[4];

               - procedure of filling of particular military positions of the Armed Forces by

civilian personnel in peace times was improved (upon conditions of fixed term
employment contract)[5].
Measures taken[6] have provided the development and effective use of human

resources, and increased the quality of staffing the Armed Forces with highly qualified
officers and contract service personnel. Herewith preferences were given to those people
who have high level of professional training and practical experience of participation in
international operations on peace and security support.

Service Personnel Comprehensive Evaluation System

Objectivity of the service personnel official activities’ evaluation, avoidance of
subjectivity and decrease of the external impact on this process are the main factors
to increase the staffing level. New Service Personnel Comprehensive Evaluation
System has been implemented with this view, which provides for annual independent
evaluation and mandatory to consider its results at the stage of training and HR
decision-making.
The procedure for the establishment and implementation of service personnel

evaluation results is given in Figure 4.1.

SUMMARY ON THE
ARMED FORCES
MANNING


The transition to manning the Armed Forces of Ukraine
exclusively with service personnel on a contract basis
continued in 2013.
5,000 conscripts were called out and recruited to the

Armed Forces in October-November 2013 by military
commissariats (Figure 4.3).

Manning with contract
service personnel

Due to the measures taken during the year over 12,000
people were enlisted on the contract basis. This allowed
to increase staffing of the Armed Forces with contract
service personnel to 69,6%. (Figure 4.4).

Service in military reserve

Manning of Constant Readiness Forces and combat units of Reserve Forces with
reservists continued during the year. The training of reservists of High Mobility
Airborne Troops and Special Operation Forces during battalion tactical exercises
was the main peculiarity of the year.
Manning of military territorial defence units with reservists started in view of

the need to create a powerful territorial reserve for natural and man-made disasters
response.
The following motivational factors for military service in reserve facilitated carrying

out of these measures:

                - the allowance for reservists who passed training was increased by 1,6 times[7]
(Figure 4.10);

Measures of military education and science system improvement were integrated
into the state educational system in the Joint Program for Military Education Reform
for the period to 2017 of the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Education and
Science[8].

Optimisation of the Network of Higher Military Educational Institutions

The improvement of the network of higher military educational institutions according
to the needs of the Armed Forces continued in 2013, namely:

  - Zhytomyr Military Institute named after Sergii Korolov and Military Institute of

Telecommunications and Information were included to the State University of
Telecommunications[9];

  - Scientific Research Institute for Problems of Military Medicine and Irpin Military

Hospital became a structural unit of the Ukrainian Military Medical Academy;

  - 4 departments of military training were established (at National Aviation

University, Odesa National Polytechnic University, Vinnytsya National Agrarian
University and Kharkiv National University of Internal Affairs);

  - organizational structures of the higher military educational institutions were

improved due to the reduce of the number of management structures and support
units.

S UM M A R Y ON T H E A R M E D F OR C E S M A N N ING

As a result of the measures taken the number of personnel of the higher military

educational institutions was optimized by 1,900 people.
In order to improve military experts training the following measures were taken:

  - the number of students admitted to correspondence training was decreased. 18

people were admitted to this training in 2013 (in 2012 – 173 people);

  - the training of specialists in finance, law, translation and other specialties similar

to civil specialists stopped;

  - the list of specialties according to “student-cadet” system was enlarged

(engineer-armour crewman, NBC protection experts);

  - training of cadets on Mig-29 combat aircraft including practical flights started.
The training of military experts was carried out as at the end of 2013 in the following

manner (Figure 4.11):

Disposal of surplus rockets, ammunition and rocket fuel components, unsuitable for
further use and storage is still the main challenge of the Armed Forces’ reformation
and development.

Rocket and ammunition disposal

In 2013, for the period of 2008–2017, to implement the State Target Defence
Programme of disposal of conventional ammunition, which are unsuitable for further
use, 91,2 million hryvnias were allocated (19,1% of the funds provided by the State
Disposal Programme) according to the State Disposal Programme.

Actually, 59,8 million hryvnias (65,6 % of funds provided by the State Budget of

Ukraine) were allocated for the rockets and ammunition disposal and 49,0 thousand
tons of ammunition were recycled (Figure 6.2 ).

Forces of Ukraine.

Disposal of Surplus Military Property of the Armed Forces of Ukraine

In 2013 the main efforts of MoD were aimed at standardization of the regulatory base
of military assets release and disposal including the lands.
The sale procedure of military property and lands where military assets are situated

were defined and came into effect in August 1, 2013[11].
429 military communities (7430 facilities) on 35,9 thousand hectares of land were
released at the end of 2013. 96 of them were included into land list which can be
released with objects of military real estate[12].
Transition of housing to the communal property of appropriate communities

due to limitation of funds on the transfer from the National Budget of Ukraine for
implementation of these actions by the local budgets is still the main issue.

property are registered in the Center of Surplus Military Property of the Armed Forces
of Ukraine. 8 thousand items of surplus property and 30 thousand items of military
property (30 % of the total number of surplus military property) are kept in military
