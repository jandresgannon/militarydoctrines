**NATIONAL DEFENSE DIRECTIVE 01/2008**

**1. INTRODUCTION**

The sphere of security and defence has experienced important changes in recent

years. The rise of new risks and threats, the implications of globalization and the

growing complexity of conflicts require the design and implementation of a Spanish

security and defence system that can effectively respond to these challenges,

safeguarding our national interests. Therefore, it is imperative to integrate and

harmonize all national instruments and resources to ensure the unity of State action.

The first steps in this direction took place through National Defence Directive 1/2004,

which contained the general concepts of the 2003 Strategic Defence Review and

introduced important novelties in the formulation of our defence policy. The

subsequent Organic Law on National Defence 5/2005 highlighted the growing

international projection of Spain and our defence policy within the context of foreign

action by the State, attributing to the President of the Government the authority to

direct the defence policy, determine its objectives and formulate the National Defence

Directive.

Leadership by the President of the Government is in line with the general tendency of

partner and allied countries to integrate the objectives related to security from each of

the sectoral policies into a single national strategy; thus ensuring its coherence and

coordination and replacing the current inter-ministerial contributions to security and

defence with a broader comprehensive focus.

The National Defence Directive will therefore be framed in a National Security

Strategy, the need for which is evident. This should incorporate the fundamental

values and interests, should analyse risks, threats and vulnerabilities as well as their

causes, should establish frames of action and contain the bases for providing a

comprehensive response that guarantees the protection of the national interests

while ensuring respect for the constitutional values and international treaties that

Spain has entered into.

The National Security Strategy will be coherent with the strategies adopted by the

international organizations of which Spain is a member. A correct alignment with the

evolution of the strategic situation should be ensured by means of regular reviews.

**2. STRATEGIC ISSUES**

**a. The strategic scenario**

The current strategic scenario is characterised by complexity, uncertainty and

potential danger. Current and foreseeable conflicts are multi-dimensional in their

configuration, which makes resolution by strictly political, diplomatic, economic or

military means unfeasible.

This multi-dimensional configuration of conflicts derives from the growing number of

actors involved, public and private, governmental and non-governmental; the

conjunction of political, economic, cultural, ethnic or religious components that

intervene in various degrees of intensity; and the breadth of extension over space

and time. Breadth of space due to globalization can turn the effects of even a local

conflict into one with much broader repercussions, so that borders do not necessarily

constitute any longer the frame of reference for guaranteeing national security.

Conflicts extend over time because crises that remained latent, with no definitive

CONSEJO DE DEFENSA NACIONAL

resolution, have frequently been re-activated in a very violent and unexpected

manner.

The traditional risks and threats to security, which formerly implied almost exclusively

military responses, are now accompanied by others that, although they may not have

the destructive capacity of a conventional war, complicate and degrade the social

and economic development of countries and regions, producing negative

consequences at both national and international levels.

In this regard, **terrorism, organized crime and the proliferation of weapons of**

**mass destruction constitute the most important set of transnational threats to our**

society. A hypothetical combination of them holds the greatest potential for danger

and would produce devastating consequences. The attacks of September 11, 2001

in the United States, of March 11, 2004 in Spain, and of July 7, 2005 in the United

Kingdom, among others, indicate an escalation in the capacity and will to cause harm

through terrorist actions, an option within reach of many actors.

**Failed, weak or fragile States, as well as** **regional conflicts give rise to serious**

crises in the form of famines, extreme poverty, epidemics, avalanches of refugees

and displaced people, migratory movements and indiscriminate violence that have

repercussions on other States and maritime space. They may also threaten energy

security by limiting access to certain energy sources and placing global distribution

networks at risk.

The **fight for access to basic resources is expected to become one of the main**

sources of conflict in coming years. The economic drive and the demographic

dimension of certain emerging countries are generating competition for resources,

sources of energy and, in some areas, water, resulting in economic crises with great

social repercussions. In addition, economic development is taking place in an


-----

CONSEJO DE DEFENSA NACIONAL

unbalanced and irregular manner in some areas, giving rise to deep social

inequalities, massive migration and even negative environmental effects.

The effects of humanity on the environment also appear to be generating the birth of

a new phenomenon, **climate change, the instability of which may lead to the**

appearance or increase of recurring natural phenomena that give rise to **disasters.**

Even today, their occurrence and consequences are difficult to predict, especially

when they generate, among other things, health or sanitary risks and the interruption

of critical networks and infrastructures.

Finally, the technological revolution of the “Information Era” has introduced a new

dimension in the area of security and defence, **cyberspace, which generates**

vulnerabilities that can interrupt or condition the normal functioning of society.

**b. Frames of action and decision**

Spain, in solidarity as a member of the United Nations, is deeply committed to the

values of international peace and security and contributes to upholding them by a

firm dedication to effective multilateralism and active participation in operations of

peace, crisis management and conflict resolution, endorsed by the Security Council.

National security is intrinsically and inextricably linked to the security of Europe. For

this reason, Spain promotes and encourages a solid European Security and Defence

Policy, with the military and civil capabilities necessary to face the contingencies or

crises that arise and to effectively contribute to world peace in accordance with the

Charter of the United Nations. European security is also reinforced through measures

to foster trust and security under the auspices of the Organization for Security and

Co-operation in Europe (OSCE).

The **Atlantic Alliance is still the basis of the collective defence of its members.**

Therefore, the final objective of a European defence developed by the European

Union itself should be designed as a reinforcement of transatlantic relations. In this

context, Spain supports a NATO endowed with adequate military capabilities for

action in order to effectively face new global challenges in the area of security and

defence.

The security of Spain is also linked to the security of the Mediterranean area, and for

this reason it is crucial to have the Mediterranean become an area of peace, stability

and shared prosperity.

Our country maintains a special relationship with **Latin-America, constituting the**

natural bridge for union and exchange between the two shores of the Atlantic. From

this position, Spain will continue fostering intensified relations of bilateral, regional

and multilateral cooperation in matters of defence policy.

In addition, globalization is causing geographical areas that formerly had limited

influence to now appear prominently on the international scene. This affects Spain in

regard to both the area of Sub-Saharan Africa and the **Asia-Pacific region, as**

geographical areas in which an important effort in pacification and stabilization by the

international community has become necessary.

In the **national sphere, the Armed Forces must maintain a deterrent and reaction**

capability that is sufficient to defend Spain. Furthermore, there is an increasing

demand by Spanish society for the public administrations to respond effectively in

serious situations of emergency, risk, catastrophe and other security needs. The

Armed Forces can greatly contribute to alleviating their effects, providing the rapid

reaction capability, availability and preparation to face these types of situations.

**c. Principles of Spanish security and defence**

Spain considers its sovereignty, territorial integrity and constitutional order as

essential **interests,** to be defended along with ensuring the freedom, life and

prosperity of its citizens. In the current international context, the defence of these

interests requires not limiting the actions of the State to the national territory since the

interests of Spain and the Spanish people extend beyond our borders. For this

reason, another essential objective for Spain is the achievement of a stable

international order of peace, security and respect for human rights.

The protection of these interests lies within the framework of the **values that are**

defined in our legal system. Among the most prominent are the utmost respect for

human rights and the compulsory legal norms and legitimacy provided by the

competent national organisms and the international organizations to which Spain

belongs, particularly the United Nations.

Security and defence are competencies that the State guarantees through the

integration of diverse instruments and policies. They are not therefore responsibilities

assumed only by the Ministry of Defence, but instead require a **multi-disciplinary**

**focus and comprehensive action by the entire set of competent public**

administrations, along with the confluence of civil and military as well as public and

private instruments. In this regard, security and defence require the maintenance of

**our own means and resources with a high degree of preparation, coordination and**

availability; capable of acting as an element of dissuasion and providing an effective,

integrated and, if necessary, autonomous action response to safeguard our national

interests. The collective defence and shared security of our partners and allies also

contributes to this end and to the preservation of international peace and security.
