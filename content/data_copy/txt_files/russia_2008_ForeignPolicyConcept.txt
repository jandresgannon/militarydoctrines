# THE FOREIGN POLICY CONCEPT OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION

January 12, 2008

## I. General provisions

 The Foreign Policy Concept of the Russian Federation (hereinafter referred

 to as ”the Concept“) is a system of views on the content, principles and main areas

 of the foreign policy activities of Russia.

 This Concept shall supplement and develop the provisions of the Foreign Policy Concept

 of the Russian Federation, approved by the President of the Russian Federation

 on 28June 2000.

 This Concept shall be based on the Constitution of the Russian Federation, Federal Laws,

 generally recognized principles and norms of international law, international treaties

 of the Russian Federation, instruments of the Russian Federation governing the activities

 of the state authorities of the Russian Federation in the area of foreign policy, as well

 as the Concept of National Security of the Russian Federation, Military Doctrine

 of the Russian Federation and other relevant documents.

 International developments in the field of international relations in the beginning

 of the 21stcentury and strengthening of Russia have required reassessment of the overall

 situation around Russia, rethinking of the priorities of the Russian foreign policy with due

 account for the increased role of the country in international affairs, its greater

 responsibility for global developments and related possibilities to participate

 in the implementation of the international agenda, as well as in its development.

 As regards the international situation, along with a positive trend, i.e. the strengthening


-----

## of the positions of the Russian Federation in international affairs, negative trends

 emerged that are to be considered in conducting foreign policy of Russia in specific areas.

 In accordance with the uppermost priority of the national security policy, i.e. protection

 of interests of the individual, society and the state, main foreign policy efforts should focus

 on achieving the following chief objectives:

 to ensure national security, to preserve and strengthen its sovereignty and territorial

 integrity, to achieve strong positions of authority in the world community that best meet

 the interests of the Russian Federation as one of influential centers in the modern world,

 and which are necessary for the growth of its political, economic, intellectual and spiritual

 potential;

 to create favorable external conditions for the modernization of Russia, transformation

 of its economy along innovation lines, enhancement of the living standards, consolidation

 of society, strengthening of the foundations of the constitutional system, rule of law

 and democratic institutions, realization of human rights and freedoms and,

 as a consequence, ensuring competitiveness of the country in a globalizing world;

 to influence global processes to ensure formation of a just and democratic world order,

 based on collectiveness in finding solutions to international problems and supremacy

 of international law, first of all provisions of the UN Charter, as well as relations of equal

 partnership among States with a central and coordinating role of the UN as the key

 organization governing international relations and possessing a unique legitimacy;

 to promote good neighborly relations with bordering States, to assist in eliminating

 the existing hotbeds of tension and conflicts in the regions adjacent to the Russian

 Federation and other areas of the world and to prevent emergence of the new ones;

 to search for agreement and coinciding interests with other States and international

 associations in the process of finding solutions to the tasks according to Russia's national

 priorities, to establish, on that basis, a system of bilateral and multilateral partnerships

 aimed to ensure stability of the international position of the country in the face

 of international foreign policy volatility;


-----

## to provide comprehensive protection of rights and legitimate interests of Russian citizens

 and compatriots abroad;

 to promote an objective image of the Russian Federation globally as a democratic state

 committed to a socially oriented market economy and an independent foreign policy;

 to promote and propagate, in foreign States, the Russian language and Russian peoples'

 culture constituting a unique contribution to cultural and civilizational diversity

 of the contemporary world and to the development of an intercivilizational partnership.

 II. The modern world and the foreign policy of the Russian Federation

 The modern world is going through fundamental and dynamic changes that profoundly

 affect the interests of the Russian Federation and its citizens. Anew Russia, basing

 on a solid foundation of its national interests, has now acquired a full-fledged role

 in global affairs.

 Differences between domestic and external means of ensuring national interests

 and security are gradually disappearing.

 In this context, our foreign policy becomes one of major instruments of the steady national

 development and of ensuring its competitiveness in a globalizing world.

 Russia, being a permanent member of the UN Security Council, participant in the G8

 and other authoritative international and regional organizations, intergovernmental

 dialogue and cooperation mechanisms, and as a country possessing a major potential

 and significant resources in all spheres of human activities, vigorously developing

 relations with leading States and associations throughout the world and integrating

 consistently into the world economy and politics, exerts a substantial influence upon

 the development of a new architecture of international relations.

 Drastic transformation of international relations, the end of ideological confrontation

 and steady overcoming of the Cold War legacy and its prejudices and stereotypes,

 the strengthening of Russia and its international position have all contributed


-----

## to significant enhancement of global cooperation. The threat of a fullscale war, including

 a nuclear one, has been diminished.

 Today, traditional cumbersome military and political alliances can no longer provide

 for counteracting the whole range of modern challenges and threats which are

 transnational in their nature. Bloc approaches to international problems are being

 replaced by a network diplomacy based on flexible forms of participation in international

 structures for the search of joint solutions to common tasks.

 Together with the military power of States, economic, scientific and technological,

 environmental, demographic and informational factors are coming to the fore as major

 factors of influence of a state on international affairs. Ofincreasing influence are: the level

 of protection of interests of the individual, as well as those of society and the state;

 spiritual and intellectual development of citizens; improved wellbeing of people; balance

 of educational, scientific and production resources; general level of investments in human

 capital; efficient use of mechanisms governing global markets of goods and services,

 diversified economic relations; comparative advantages of States in integration

 processes. Economic interdependence of States is becoming one of key factors

 of international stability. Prerequisites are being created for building a more stable

 and crisisresistant world order.

 At the same time, new challenges and threats (first of all, international terrorism,

 narcotraffic, organized crime, spread of weapons of mass destruction and means of their

 delivery, regional conflicts, demographic problems, global poverty, including energy

 poverty, as well as illegal migration and climate change) are global problems that require

 adequate response of the entire international community and solidarity efforts

 to overcome them. The ecological factor is playing an increasingly important role,

 the problem of prevention of and counteracting infectious diseases is becoming evermore

 urgent. The complex nature of challenges facing the international community requires

 development of a balanced strategy of their solution, based on the interrelationship

 of issues of security, social and economic development and human rights protection.

 The contradictory trends determining the current state of international relations are

 a result of the transitional period in their development. Those trends are reflecting

 differences in understanding of a genuine meaning and consequences of the end


-----

## of the Cold War. It is for the first time in the contemporary history that global competition is

 acquiring a civilizational dimension which suggests competition between different value

 systems and development models within the framework of universal democratic

 and market economy principles.

 As the constraints of the bipolar confrontation are being overcome, the cultural

 and civilizational diversity of the modern world is increasingly in evidence. Areligious factor

 in shaping the system of contemporary international relations is growing, inter alia,

 as regards its moral foundation. This problem cannot be resolved without a common

 denominator that has always existed in major world religions.

 The reaction to the prospect of loss by the historic West of its monopoly in global

 processes finds its expression, in particular, in the continued political and psychological

 policy of ”containing“ Russia, including the use of a selective approach to history, for those

 purposes, first of all as regards the World War Two and the postwar period.

 The need for the international community to develop a common vision of our era is

 becoming evermore urgent, which could only be achieved through open and honest

 substantive discussions of the problems confronting the mankind. What is needed is

 to provide favorable conditions for scientists to carry out their professional work with

 a view to establishing the historical truth and preventing historical issues from becoming

 an instrument of practical policy.

 The unilateral action strategy leads to destabilization of international situation, provokes

 tensions and arms race, exacerbates interstate differences, stirs up ethnic and religious

 strife, endangers security of other States and fuels tensions in intercivilizational relations.

 Coercive measures with the use of military force in circumvention of the UN Charter

 and Security Council cannot overcome deep social, economic, ethnic and other

 differences underlying conflicts, undermines the basic principles of international law

 and leads to enlargement of conflict space, including in the geopolitical area around

 Russia.

 The UN is to play a fundamental role in developing full-fledged intercivilizational dialogue

 aimed at reaching agreement between representatives of various religions, confessions

 and cultures.


-----

## Russia will continue to seek the strengthening of principles of multilateralism

 in international affairs, development of an architecture of international relations that

 would be based on the recognition by the international community of the principles

 of security indivisibility in the modern world and would reflect its diversity.

 The interests of Russia are directly connected to other global tendencies, inter alia:

 globalization of the world economy. This trend along with complementary opportunities

 for social and economic progress and development of human contacts, is fraught with

 new dangers, especially for weak economies. The threat of largescale financial

 and economic crises is growing, as well as development imbalances in various regions

 of the world which are a result of unequal starting positions and domestic potentials

 to respond to the modernization challenges. The globalization process confronts

 the increasing desire of individual States to protect their economic sovereignty, and such

 kind of protectionism often acquires the forms of economic nationalism when pragmatic

 interests are substituted with political considerations. The cultural identity

 of the overwhelming majority of countries and peoples suffers the increasing onslaught

 of globalization;

 growing role, due to objective factors, of multilateral diplomacy, international institutions

 and mechanisms in global policy and economy, as a result of growing interdependence

 of States and the need to make global development more manageable;

 enhanced economic potential of the emerging global growth centers, inter alia, as a result

 of a more equal distribution of development resources due to liberalization of global

 markets. The economic growth in those countries and regions converts into their political

 influence, the trend to a polycentric world order growing further;

 development of regional and subregional integration in the area of the Community

 of Independent States (CIS), in the Euro-Atlantic and Asia-Pacific regions, in Africa

 and Latin America. Integration associations are acquiring an evergrowing importance

 in the global economy and emerge as a major factor of regional and subregional security,

 including peacemaking activities;


-----

## military and political rivalry of regional powers; growing separatism, ethno national

 and religious extremism. Integration processes, including in the Euro-Atlantic region, are

 often of selective and restrictive nature. Attempts to lower the role of a sovereign state

 as a fundamental element of international relations and to divide States into categories

 with different rights and responsibilities, are fraught with undermining the international

 rule of law and arbitrary interference in internal affairs of sovereign States;

 ignoring by individual States and their groups of major principles of international law.

 Russia advocates full universality of the generally recognized norms of international law

 both in their understanding and application.

 Strengthening of international position of Russia and solution of the tasks related

 to the establishment of equal mutually beneficial partnerships with all countries,

 successful promotion of our foreign economic interests and provision of political,

 economic, information and cultural influence abroad require the use of all available

 financial and economic tools of the state and provision of adequate resources

 for the Russian Federation's foreign policy.

 The Russian Federation possesses real capacity to play a welldeserved role globally.

 In this respect, of fundamental importance are the following factors: strengthened

 Russian statehood, stable economic growth, further political and economic reforms,

 resolution of social problems, overcoming of the resource-based economy and its

 transition to innovations, as well as improved demographic situation. Other important

 factors include the strengthened civil society institutes and governmental support

 to national nongovernmental organizations interested in promoting Russia's foreign policy

 interests.

 Russia pursues an open, predictable and pragmatic foreign policy determined by its

 national interests. Russia develops international cooperation on the basis of equality,

 mutual respect for interests and mutual benefit.

 Balanced and multivector character of Russia's foreign policy is its distinguishing feature.

 This is due to a geopolitical position of Russia as the largest EuroAsian power, its status

 as one of the leading States of the world and a permanent member of the UN Security


-----

## Council. Our national interests today make it imperative to actively promote positive

 agenda covering the whole spectrum of international problems.

 Russia fully recognizes its responsibility for maintenance of security both globally

 and regionally and is prepared to take joint actions with all other States concerned aimed

 at finding solutions to common problems. Should our partners be unprepared for joint

 efforts, Russia, in order to protect its national interests, will have to act unilaterally but

 always on the basis of international law.

 Russia is not going to get involved in a costly confrontation, including renewed arms race,

 destructive for its economy and disastrous for its internal development.

 III. Priorities of the Russian Federation for addressing global problems

 Diversity and complexity of international problems and crisis situations call for a timely

 assessment of each of them when implementing the Russian Federation's foreign policy.

 The use of political and diplomatic, legal, military, economic, financial and other

 instruments in handling foreign policy tasks should be commensurate with their real value

 in terms of safeguarding Russia's foreign policy interests; moreover, these instruments

 should be applied on the basis of adequate coordination among all branches of power

 as well as appropriate agencies.

 1. The emergence of a new world order

 Russia looks forward to emergence of a stable system of international relations based

 on the principles of equality, mutual respect and mutually beneficial cooperation as well

 as the norms of international law. Such a system aims at ensuring reliable and equal

 security for every member of the international community in the political, military,

 economic, information, humanitarian and other areas and employs multilateral diplomacy

 as its main tool.

 The United Nations, an organization for which there is no real alternative and which has

 a unique legitimacy, should continue to serve as a clearing-house for the coordination

 of international relations and world politics in the 21stcentury. Russia supports the efforts

 aimed at strengthening its central and coordinating role. This implies:


-----

## strict observance of the ends and principles enshrined in the UN Charter;

 rational reform of the UN so that it could gradually adapt itself to changing global political

 and economic realities;

 further improving the effectiveness of the work of the UN Security Council, which has

 the primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security,

 and making this body more representative in the course of the reform while keeping its

 work as expeditious as possible. Any decisions on the enlargement of the Security Council

 should enjoy the widest agreement of the States Members of the United Nations. The five

 permanent members of the Security Council shall retain their status.

 Russia attaches great importance to improving the manageability of the world

 development and establishing a self-regulating international system, an effort that

 requires collective leadership by the leading States, which should be representative

 in geographical and civilizational terms and fully respect the central and coordinating role

 of the UN. For these ends, Russia will make itself more fully engaged in such formats

 as the Group of Eight and its dialogue with its traditional partners, the Troika (Russia, India

 and China) and the BRIC Four (Brazil, Russia, India and China), as well as by more actively

 using other informal structures and venues for dialogue.

 2. The primacy of law in international relations

 Russia consistently supports the strengthening of the legal basis of international relations

 and complies with its international legal obligations in good faith. The maintenance

 and strengthening of international rule of law is among its priorities in the international

 arena. The rule of law is intended to ensure a peaceful and fruitful cooperation among

 States while maintaining the balance of their often conflicting interests as well

 as safeguarding the interests of the world community as a whole. Adherence

 to international law is important for safeguarding the interests of our country, its nationals

 and legal entities. Russia intends to:

 ensure compliance by the international stakeholders with their international obligations

 both to Russia and to the world community as a whole; combat violations of international

 law by States, international organizations, non-governmental organizations


-----

## and individuals. The globalization of challenges and threats to security and sustainable

 development increases the importance of the UN Security Council as a universal

 instrument for safeguarding international rule of law;

 counter the attempts by individual countries or groups of countries to revise

 the universally accepted norms of international law enshrined in universal documents

 such as the UN Charter, the 1970 Declaration on Principles of International Law

 concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States in accordance with the UN

 Charter, as well as in the CSCE FinalAct of 1975. Arbitrary and politically motivated

 interpretation by certain countries of fundamental international legal norms and principles

 such as non-use of force or threat of force, peaceful settlement of international disputes,

 respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity of States, right of peoples to self
 determination, as well as the attempts to portray violations of international law as its

 ”creative“ application, are especially detrimental to international peace, law and order.

 Such actions erode the basis of international law and inflict a lasting damage to its

 authority;

 promote the codification and progressive development of international law, especially

 under the UN aegis, universal acceptance of the UN treaties and their uniform

 interpretation and application and, in general, a careful treatment of these unique legal

 instruments and the regimes established by them;

 strive to strengthen the international legal basis of cooperation within the CIS and in other

 regional and subregional forums, put our strategic relations with the European Union

 on a solid and modern legal basis and establish a legal space under the auspices

 of the Council of Europe that would span across the entire Europe;

 make efforts to complete the process of legal regulation of the State border of the Russian

 Federation as well as of boundaries of maritime areas over which it exercises its sovereign

 rights and jurisdiction.

 3. Strengthening international security

 Russia consistently calls for diminished role of the force factor in international relations

 with simultaneous enhancement of strategic and regional stability. Towards these ends,


-----

## the Russian Federation:

 unswervingly fulfils its international obligations under international treaties in the sphere

 of nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction, arms control and disarmament,

 as well as takes confidence-building measures in military sphere; participates

 in negotiations to work out and conclude new accords in these fields consistent with its

 national interests and on the basis of the principles of equality and indivisibility of security;

 reaffirms its unfailing policy of developing multilateral foundations of nonproliferation

 of nuclear weapons, other weapons of mass destruction and means of their delivery;

 stands for compliance with the NonProliferation Treaty, the Convention on the Prohibition

 of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin

 Weapons and on Their Destruction, as well as the Convention on the Prohibition

 of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their

 Destruction; is actively engaged in international endeavors to control traffic of dualuse

 materials and technologies; promotes the early entry into force of the Comprehensive

 Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty; supports a global missile nonproliferation regime on the basis

 of a legally binding agreement;

 (intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched ballistic missiles as well as heavy

 bombers and warheads they carry) up to a minimum level sufficient to maintain strategic

 stability;

 promotes the prevention of deployment of weapons in outer space and the establishment

 of a system of collective response to potential missile threats on an equal basis,

 and opposes unilateral actions in the field of strategic antimissile defense that are

 destabilizing international situation;

 considers that the present fundamental development trends, including the emerging

 multipolarity, and diversification of risks and threats lead to the conclusion that

 the strategic stability issue cannot anymore be addressed exclusively within

 the framework of Russia- US relations. Objectively, the time is coming to involve major

 States in these endeavors, first of all nuclear ones, interested in joint actions to ensure

 common security. This is the essence of the strategic openness underlying Russian


-----

## initiatives, in particular those related to collective counteraction to potential missile

 threats for Europe and to lending of globalized character to the regime of the Treaty

 Between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United States of America

 on the Elimination of Their Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles of 1987;

 consistently speaks for the prevention of the arms race, opposes attempts to develop

 and deploy destabilizing, including new types, weapons, such as lowyield nuclear

 warheads, nonnuclear intercontinental ballistic missiles, and strategic antimissile

 systems;

 attaches special attention to such an important aspect of consolidating strategic stability

 as ensuring international information security;

 supports international efforts against illegal traffic of light and small arms;

 intends to further promote enhanced regional stability in Europe through participation

 in the processes of conventional armed forces limitation and reduction as well as through

 confidence-building measures in military sphere on the basis of the principle of equal

 security for all parties;

 regards international peacemaking as an effective instrument for settling armed conflicts

 and resolving post-crisis nation building tasks and intends to increase its participation

 in international peacemaking activities under the auspices of the United Nations

 and within the framework of collaboration with regional and international organizations;

 and will actively contribute to improving the United Nations preventive anti-crisis potential;

 firmly proceeds from the premise that only the UN Security Council has the authority

 to sanction the use of force for the purpose of coercion to peace;

 regards Article51 of the UN Charter as an adequate and not subject to revision legal basis

 for the use of force in self-defense, including in the face of existing threats to peace

 and security such as international terrorism and proliferation of weapons of mass

 destruction;


-----

## views fighting international terrorism as its most important domestic and foreign policy

 task taking into account the necessity of systemic and comprehensive use of politico
 legal, advocacy, socio-economic and special measures focusing on the preventive aspect

 of such counteraction; calls for elaboration of further measures aimed at consolidation

 of the global anti-terrorism coalition under the UN aegis with the participation of regional

 organizations without resorting to double standards and on the basis of universal anti
 terrorism conventions and decisions of the UN Security Council; will promote the right

 of every individual regardless of his/her nationality, race, sex or religion for the protection

 against terrorism and terrorist acts. Russia, in accordance with international law and its

 legislation, will take all necessary measures to repel and prevent terrorist attacks against

 itself and its citizens, to protect them against terrorist acts, prohibit activities within its

 territory aimed at organizing such acts against citizens or interests of other countries,

 and not give refuge or floor to terrorists and instigators of terrorism;

 will seek political and diplomatic settlement of regional conflicts on the basis of collective

 actions of the international community proceeding from the premise that modern conflicts

 cannot be solved by the use of force, their settlement should be sought through

 engagement in dialogue and negotiations of all parties rather than through isolation

 of one of them;

 targeted efforts to counter drug trafficking and organized crime in cooperation with other

 States both multilaterally, especially within the framework of specialized international

 bodies, and bilaterally;

 supports establishment of effective institutions under the auspices of the United Nations

 and other international and regional organizations to ensure cooperation in the response

 to calamities and large-scale man-made disasters, as well as to other emergencies,

 including mitigation capacity building and enhancement of early warning and forecast

 systems;

 participates in international cooperation aimed at regulating migration processes

 and ensuring rights of migrant workers;

 as a multinational and multiconfessional state facilitates dialogue and partnership

 between cultures, religions and civilizations, consistently pursues this policy in the United


-----

## Nations, UNESCO, OSCE and the Council of Europe, as well as other international

 and regional organizations, including in the context of cooperation with the Organization

 of the Islamic Conference; supports relevant initiatives of the civil society and actively

 interacts with the Russian Orthodox Church and other main confessions of the country.

 4. International economic and environmental cooperation

 Russia has been making a considerable contribution to the stability of the global economy

 and finance by its steadily high economic growth, which to a great extent is based

 on the increasing domestic demand, and by its natural and accumulated financial

 resources. Consequently, Russia proposes to contribute, including through joining

 the World Trade Organization and the Organization of Economic Cooperation

 and Development, to shaping a just and democratic architecture of global trade,

 economic, monetary and financial relations with a view to becoming a fullfledged

 and efficient member of it.

 The main priority of the Russian Federation's policy in the area of international economic

 relations is to contribute to the development of its national economy in the environment

 of globalization by ensuring equal positions of the country and Russian business

 in the system of world economic links. To achieve this goal, the Russian Federation:

 seeks maximum benefit and minimizes risks in the process of further integration of Russia

 in the world economy taking into account the need to ensure economic, energy and food

 security of the country;

 creates favorable political conditions for diversifying Russia's presence in the world

 markets through expanding the export range and geography of foreign economic

 and investment links of Russia;

 takes trade policy measures to protect interests of the Russian Federation in accordance

 with international rules and counteracts trade and political measures of foreign States

 encroaching upon the rights of the Russian Federation and Russian enterprises;

 provides state support to Russian enterprises and companies in getting access to new

 markets and in developing traditional markets, counteracts discrimination of national


-----

## investors and exporters, especially in the markets of hightech products and goods of high

 level of procession;

 assists in drawing foreign investments in science-intensive and other priority areas

 of the Russian economy;

 continues to build up and modernize the capacity of the fuel and energy industry

 to support its reputation of a responsible partner in the energy markets, while ensuring

 sustainable development of its economy and contributing to the maintenance of balanced

 world energy markets;

 strengthens strategic partnership with the leading producers of energy resources,

 develops active dialogue with consuming countries and transit countries on the basis

 of the principles of energy security enshrined in the final documents of the Saint

 Petersburg G8 Summit in 2006, assuming that measures being taken to guarantee

 reliability of energy supplies should be consistently supported by forthcoming activities

 aimed at ensuring stability of demand and secure transit;

 actively employs possibilities of regional economic and financial organizations to protect

 interests of the Russian Federation in the corresponding regions, paying special attention

 to the activities of organizations and institutions that contribute to strengthening

 of integration processes in the CIS space;

 in accordance with the norms of international law, uses all available economic leverage,

 resources and competitive advantages to protect its national interests.

 The Russian Federation stands for expanding international cooperation in order to ensure

 environmental security and to counter climate changes on the planet, including through

 the use of brandnew energy-saving and resource-saving technologies, in the interest

 of the entire world community. Among priorities in this sphere are further development

 of science-based approaches to the preservation of the healthy natural environment

 and increased interaction with all the States of the world in the area of environmental

 protection with a view to ensuring sustainable development of the present and future

 generations. The Russian Federation:


-----

## regards sustainable socio economic development of all countries as an indispensable

 component of the modern collective security system and believes that international

 development assistance should be aimed at searching for effective ways to support efforts

 to eliminate the disbalances in the development of various regions. For these ends,

 Russia, using its donor capacity, pursues an active and targeted policy in the area

 of international development assistance both multilaterally and bilaterally;

 supports international cooperation in healthcare with the leading role of the World Health

 Organization as one of the priorities in the global agenda and as an integral component

 of ensuring sustainable development.

 Given the growing importance of sea areas, both from the economic point of view

 and in terms of strengthening security, their effective use has become a pressing task.

 For these purposes, the Russian Federation will try to ensure safe navigation regimes that

 would meet its national interests, as well as responsible fishing and research activities

 in the World Ocean combined with the measures to protect sea environment, fight

 terrorism and counter spread weapons of mass destruction. In accordance with

 the international law, Russia intends to establish the boundaries of its continental shelf,

 thus expanding opportunities for exploration and exploitation of its mineral resources.

 5. International humanitarian cooperation and human rights

 Russia, being committed to universal democratic values, including protection of human

 rights and freedoms, sees its goals in the following:

 to seek respect for human rights and freedoms in the entire world through a constructive

 international dialogue on the basis of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, taking

 advantage of other opportunities, including at the regional level, in the area of human

 rights, and preventing double standards, respecting national and historic peculiarities

 of each State in the process of democratic transformations without imposing borrowed

 value systems on anyone;

 to protect rights and legitimate interests of the Russian citizens and compatriots living

 abroad on the basis of international law and effective bilateral agreements, regarding


-----

## the multimillion Russian diaspora the Russian world as a partner, including

 for expanding and strengthening the space of the Russian language and culture;

 to contribute to the consolidation of the organizations of compatriots so as to ensure

 a more efficient protection by them of their rights in their countries of residence

 and to preserve the ethnic and cultural identity of the Russian diaspora and its links with

 its historic motherland, to consistently create conditions to assist in the voluntary

 resettlement to the Russian Federation of those compatriots who would make such

 choice;

 to contribute to learning and spread of the Russian language as an integral part

 of the world culture and an instrument of inter-ethnic communication;

 to firmly counter manifestations of neofascism, any forms of racial discrimination,

 aggressive nationalism, anti-Semitism and xenophobia, attempts to rewrite the history,

 use it for instigating confrontation and revanchism in the world politics, and revise

 the outcome of the World War Two;

 to develop, including through the use of the resources, potential and initiatives

 of the institutions of civil society in public diplomacy, international cultural

 and humanitarian cooperation as a means of building intercivilizational dialogue,

 achieving concord and ensuring mutual understanding between peoples, paying special

 attention to the interreligious dialogue;

 to build up interaction with international and non-governmental human rights

 organizations to strengthen universal norms in the area of human rights without double

 standards, to link them with the responsibility of persons for their actions, first of all

 in terms of preventing contempt for the feelings of believers and promoting tolerance,

 and to strengthen moral foundations in the human rights dialogue;

 on the basis of the above-mentioned to expand participation in international human rights

 conventions and agreements, and to amend the legislation of the Russian Federation

 accordingly.

 6. Information support for foreign policy activities


-----

## An important part of the foreign policy activities of the Russian Federation is

 communicating to the broad world public full and accurate information about its stand

 on the main international problems, foreign policy initiatives and actions by the Russian

 Federation, its domestic social and economic development processes and plans, as well

 as on the accomplishments of Russian culture and science.

 In public diplomacy, Russia will seek its objective perception in the world, develop its own

 effective means of information influence on public opinion abroad, strengthen the role

 of the Russian mass media in the international information environment providing them

 with essential state support, as well as actively participate in international information

 cooperation, and take necessary measures to repel information threats to its sovereignty

 and security.

 IV. Regional priorities

 Development of bilateral and multilateral cooperation with the CIS Member States

 constitutes a priority area of Russia's foreign policy.

 Russia forges friendly relations with all the CIS Member States on the basis of equality,

 mutual benefit, respect and regard for the interests of each other. Strategic partnerships

 and alliances are developed with States that demonstrate their readiness to engage

 in them.

 Russia approaches trade and economic relations with the CIS Member States taking into

 consideration the level of cooperation achieved and consistently follow market principles

 which is an important condition for promoting truly equal relationship and strengthening

 objective prerequisites for advancing modern forms of integration.

 Russia actively develops interaction between the CIS Member States in the humanitarian

 sphere by preserving and increasing common cultural and civilizational heritage that

 provides an important resource for the whole of the CIS and for each of its Member States

 in the era of globalization. Particular attention is paid to supporting compatriots who live

 in the CIS Member States, as well as to negotiating mutual agreements intended

 to protect their educational, linguistic, social, labor, humanitarian and other rights

 and freedoms.


-----

## Russia will increase cooperation with the CIS Member States in ensuring mutual security,

 including joint efforts to combat common challenges and threats, primarily international

 terrorism, extremism, drug trafficking, transnational crime, and illegal migration.

 The priorities here include elimination of terrorist and drug trafficking threats emanating

 from the territory of Afghanistan and prevention of risks of destabilization of the situations

 in Central Asia and Transcaucasia.

 To achieve these goals Russia will:

 take steps to ensure further realization of the potential of the CIS as a regional

 organization, a forum for multilateral political dialogue and mechanism

 of multidimensional cooperation with priorities set in the areas of economy, humanitarian

 interaction and combating existing and emerging challenges and threats;

 continue agreed efforts to create favorable conditions for effective establishment

 of theUnion State by gradually transforming relations between Russia and Belarus

 on the basis of market principles within the framework of developing a common economic

 space;

 actively interact with Belarus and Kazakhstan within the Eurasian Economic Community

 (EurAsEC) in order to establish a customs union and common economic space

 and encourage other EurAsEC Member States to participate in this work;

 further strengthen EurAsEC as a core element of economic integration, amechanism

 to support implementation of major water-energy, infrastructure, industry and other joint

 projects;

 promote in every possible way the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) as a key

 instrument to maintain stability and ensure security in the CIS area focusing on adapting

 the CSTO as a multifunctional integration body to the changing environment, as well

 as on ensuring capability of the CSTO Member States to take prompt and effective joint

 actions, and on transforming the CSTO into a central institution ensuring security in its

 area of responsibility.


-----

## Russia will continue to actively support peaceful resolution of conflicts in the CIS area

 based on international law, respect for earlier agreements and search for agreement

 between the parties involved, by fulfilling responsibly its mission of a mediator

 in the negotiations and peacekeeping.

 Russia's attitude towards subregional entities and other bodies to which Russia is not

 party in the CIS area is determined by their assessed real contribution into ensuring good

 neighborly relations and stability, their eagerness to take into account Russia's legitimate

 interests in practice and to duly respect existing cooperation mechanisms, such

 as the CIS, CSTO, EurAsEC, and Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO).

 In the same way Russia will define its approaches to developing comprehensive practical

 interaction in the Black Sea and Caspian Sea regions by preserving the identity

 of the Organization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation and strengthening

 the mechanism of cooperation between the Caspian States.

 The main objective of the Russian foreign policy on the European track is to create a truly

 open, democratic system of regional collective security and cooperation ensuring the unity

 of the Euro-Atlantic region, from Vancouver to Vladivostok, in such a way as not to allow its

 new fragmentation and reproduction of bloc-based approaches which still persist

 in the European architecture that took shape during the Cold War period. This is precisely

 the essence of the initiative aimed at concluding a European security treaty,

 the elaboration of which could be launched at a pan-European summit.

 Russia calls for building a truly unified Europe without divisive lines through equal

 interaction between Russia, the European Union and the United States. This would

 strengthen the positions of the Euro-Atlantic States in global competition. Being

 the biggest European State with multinational and multiconfessional society

 and centuries-old history, Russia stands ready to play a constructive role in ensuring

 a civilizational compatibility of Europe, and harmonious integration of religious minorities,

 including in view of various existing migration trends.

 Russia advocates a strengthened role of the Council of Europe as an independent

 and universal European organization that determines the level of legal standards in all its

## Member States without applying discriminatory practices against or extending privileges

 to anyone, as an important instrument of eliminating dividing lines on the continent.

 It is in Russia's interests that the OSCE fulfill in good faith its function of being a forum

 for an equitable dialogue between the OSCE participating States and for collective

 consensus decision-making on the basis of a comprehensive approach to military

 and political, economic and humanitarian aspects of security based on the balance

 of interests. In order to fully implement this function the whole process of OSCE

 functioning should be underpinned by a solid regulatory framework ensuring

 the supremacy of collective intergovernmental bodies' prerogatives.

 In the military and political sphere Russia will seek to fix the imbalances present

 in the sphere of conventional arms and armed forces reduction and to adopt new

 confidence-building measures.

 The Russian Federation will develop its relations with the European Union, which is

 a major trade, economic and foreign-policy partner, will promote strengthening in every

 possible way the interaction mechanisms, including through establishment of common

 spaces in economy, external and internal security, education, science and culture. From

 the long-term perspective, it is in the interests of Russia to agree with the European Union

 on a strategic partnership treaty setting special, most advanced forms of equitable

 and mutually beneficial cooperation with the European Union in all spheres with a view

 to establishing a visafree regime.

 The Russian Federation is interested in the strengthening of the European Union,

 development of its capacity to present agreed positions in trade, economic, humanitarian,

 foreign policy and security areas.

 The development of mutually advantageous bilateral relationships with Germany, France,

 Italy, Spain, Finland, Greece, the Netherlands, Norway and some other West-European

 States is an important resource for promoting Russia's national interests in the European

 and world affairs, as well as contributing to putting the Russian economy on an innovative

 track of development. Russia would like the potential for interaction with Great Britain

 to be used along the same lines.

## Russia has been developing onward practical interaction with Nordic countries including

 the implementation within the framework of multi-lateral mechanisms of joint cooperation

 projects in the Barents/Euro-Arctic region and the Arctic as a whole with account

 of the interests of indigenous peoples.

 Russia is open for further expansion of pragmatic and mutually respecting cooperation

 with the States of Central, Eastern and South-Eastern Europe taking into account genuine

 readiness to do so on the part of each of them.

 The Russian Federation is willing to interact with Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia in the spirit

 of good-neighborliness and on the basis of reciprocal consideration of interests.

 Of fundamental importance for Russia are the matters relating to the rights

 of the Russian-language population in accordance with the principles and norms

 of European and international law, as well as questions of ensuring sustenance

 of the Kaliningrad Region.

 Proceeding from a realistic assessment of the role of NATO, Russia deems it important

 to ensure progressive development of interaction within the format of the Russia-NATO

 Council in the interests of ensuring predictability and stability in the Euro-Atlantic Region,

 the utmost utilization of the existing potential for apolitical dialogue and practical

 cooperation in resolving issues relating to responses to common threats, such

 as terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, regional crises, drug

 trafficking, natural and man-made disasters.

 Russia will build its relationship with NATO taking into consideration the degree

 of the alliance's readiness for equal partnership, unswerving compliance with

 the principles and standards of international law, the implementation by all its members

 of the obligations, assumed within the framework of the Russia-NATO Council, not

 to ensure one's security at the expense of security of the Russian Federation, as well

 as the obligation to display military restraint. Russia maintains its negative attitude

 towards the expansion of NATO, notably to the plans of admitting Ukraine and Georgia

 to the membership in the alliance, as well as to bringing the NATO military infrastructure

 closer to the Russian borders on the whole, which violates the principle of equal security,

 leads to new dividing lines in Europe and runs counter to the tasks of increasing

 the effectiveness of joint work in search for responses to real challenges of our time.

## Russia builds its relations with the USA taking into account not only the vast potential

 of that country for mutually advantageous bilateral trade, economic, scientific,

 technological and other cooperation, but also its key influence on the state of global

 strategic stability and international situation as a whole. Russia is interested in making

 effective use of the existing broad infrastructure for interaction, including a continued

 dialogue on foreign policy, security and strategical stability issues, which permits to find

 of international law, first of all the UN Charter.

 The long-term priorities of the American track in the Russian policy consist in putting

 the relationship with the USA on a solid economic foundation, ensuring joint development

 of aculture for resolving differences on the basis of pragmatism and respect

 for the balance of interests, which will permit to ensure greater stability and predictability

 in the Russian-US relations.

 The relations with Canada, which are traditionally stable and almost immune to the effects

 of political environment, are an important element of the North American dimension

 of Russia's balanced policy. Russia is interested in boosting further the dynamics

 of bilateral trade, economic links and investment cooperation as well as interaction

 in the Arctic.

## In the context of the Russian Federation s multi vector foreign policy, the Asia Pacific

 Region has important and ever-increasing significance, which is due to Russia's belonging

 to this dynamically developing region of the world, its interest in tapping its potential

 for the realization of programs aimed at economic development of Siberia and the Far

 East, the need for strengthening regional cooperation in the field of countering terrorism,

 ensuring security and maintaining adialogue between civilizations. Russia will continue

 to actively participate in major integration mechanisms of the Asia–Pacific Region, notably

 the Asia–Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum, the mechanisms of partnership with

 the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), including the ASEAN Regional Forum.

 Further strengthening of the SCO, promoting its initiative for setting up a network

 of partner ties among all the integration associations in the Asia–Pacific Region occupy

 of Russia's foreign policy in Asia. Russia will build up the Russian–Chinese strategic

 partnership in all fields on the basis of common fundamental approaches to key issues

 of world politics as a basic constituent part of regional and global stability. Bringing

 the scope and quality of economic interaction in line with the high-level of political

 relations constitutes a major task in the field of bilateral ties.

 While deepening strategic partnership with India, Russia keeps by its line of principle

 aimed at strengthening interaction on topical international issues and comprehensive

 strengthening of the mutually advantageous bilateral ties on all fronts, particularly

 in ensuring a substantial growth in the trade and economic sphere.

 Russia shares the interest displayed by China and India in building effective foreign policy

 and economic interaction in a trilateral format– Russia-India-China.

 The Russian Federation is in favor of good-neighborly relations and creative partnership

 with Japan in the interest of the peoples of both countries. The problems inherited from

 the past should not pose an obstacle in this way. The work for finding a mutually

 acceptable solution to those issues will be continued.

 climate for Asia where there are still sources of tension and conflicts and a growing risk

 of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Our efforts will be focused on ensuring

 Russia's active participation in the search for a political solution to the nuclear problem

 of the Korean Peninsula, maintaining constructive relations with the Democratic People's

 Republic of Korea (DPRK) and the Republic of Korea, promoting dialogue between Seoul

 and Pyongyang and strengthening security in the North-East Asia.

 regarding the nuclear programme of the Islamic Republic of Iran based on the recognition

 of the right of all States Parties to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT)

 to the peaceful use of nuclear energy as well as upon strict compliance with

 the requirements of nuclear non-proliferation regime.

 The deepening crisis in Afghanistan poses a threat to the security of the southern CIS

 boundaries. Russia, in collaboration with other countries concerned, the United Nations,

 the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), the Shanghai Cooperation Organization

 (SCO) and other multilateral institutions, will make consistent efforts to prevent the export

 of terrorism and drugs from Afghanistan, find a just and lasting political solution

 to the problems of this country while respecting the rights and interests of all country's

 ethnic groups and achieve post-conflict rehabilitation of Afghanistan as a sovereign

 and peace-loving State.

 Russia will be making a substantial contribution to the stabilization of the situation

 in the Middle East by using its status as a permanent member of the United Nations

 Security Council and a member of the Quartet of international mediators. The main goal is


-----

## to channel collective efforts into achieving, on an internationally acceptable basis,

 a comprehensive and long-term settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict in all its aspects,

 including the establishment of an independent Palestinian State living in security

 and peace side by side with Israel. Such a settlement should be reached with

 the participation of all States and nations that are key actors in bringing stability

 to the region and taking into consideration their legitimate interests. The Russian

 Federation is in favor of increasing collective efforts, on the basis of mutual respect,

 to contribute to ending violence and to reach political settlement in Iraq through national

 reconciliation and full restoration of country's statehood and economy.

 To enhance its interaction with the States of the Islamic world, Russia will take advantage

 of its participation as an observer in the work of the Organization of the Islamic

 Conference and the League of Arab States, and play an active role in implementing the G8

 Partnership with the Broader Middle East and North Africa Region. Priority attention will be

 paid to developing mutually beneficial economic cooperation, in particular in the energy

 sector, with countries of this region, which is of strategic importance to Russia's national

 interests.

 Russia will enhance its multi–pronged interaction with African States at the multilateral

 and bilateral levels, including through the dialogue and cooperation within the G8,

 V. Shaping and implementing the foreign policy of the Russian Federation


-----

## The President of the Russian Federation, in conformity with his constitutional powers,

 directs its national foreign policy and, in his capacity of the Head of State, acts on behalf

 of the Russian Federation on the international stage.

 The Federation Council and the State Duma of the Federal Assembly of the Russian

 Federation, within the framework of their constitutional powers, provide legislative support

 for the country's foreign policy, take measures to fulfill its international obligations as well

 as enhance the efficiency of parliamentary diplomacy.

 The Government of the Russian Federation acts to implement the country's foreign policy.

 The Security Council of the Russian Federation assesses the challenges and threats

 to the national interests and security of Russia in the international sphere, submits

 proposals to the President of the Russian Federation for his decision as the Head of State

 on issues of foreign policy of the Russian Federation in the field of national security,

 as well as on coordination of activities of federal executive bodies and executive bodies

 of the Subjects of the Russian Federation in the process of the implementation

 of the decisions taken in the area of ensuring national security, and evaluates

 the efficiency of those decisions.

 The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation develops a general foreign policy

 strategy for the Russian Federation, submits relevant proposals to the President

 of the Russian Federation and implements the foreign policy of the Russian Federation

 in accordance with this Concept, as well as coordinates foreign policy activities

 of the federal executive bodies.

-----

## relations of the Subjects of the Russian Federation, which operate under the Foreign

 Ministry of the Russian Federation. The development of cooperation in regions and border

 areas is an important reserve for bilateral relations with relevant countries and regions

 in the trade, economic, humanitarian and other fields.

 In working out foreign policy decisions, the federal executive bodies cooperate,

 on a permanent basis, with the Chambers of the Federal Assembly of the Russian

 Federation, political parties, non-governmental organizations, the academic community

 and business associations of Russia encouraging their participation in international

 cooperation. A broader involvement of civil society in the foreign policy process is

 consistent with the trends of Russia's domestic development, meets the goal

 of maintaining agreement in the country on foreign policy issues and contributes to its

 efficient execution.

 In financing foreign policy activities, the resources of the Federal Budget should be used

 more extensively, with non-budget funds being attracted through the mechanism

 of the State-private partnership on a voluntary basis.

 The consistent execution of Russia's foreign policy is called upon to create favorable

 conditions for the realization of the historic choice of the peoples of the Russian

 Federation in favor of rule of law, a democratic society and socially-oriented market

 economy.
