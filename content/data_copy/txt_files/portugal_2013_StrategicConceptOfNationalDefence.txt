# I. Introduction

The previous national defence strategic concept was approved in 2003. There is no doubt that in the last decade the strategic situation and the international environment have changed significantly, due to the emergence of new, unexpected and important conditioning factors. On the one hand, Europe's economic and financial crisis, particularly in the Euro zone, initiated a new phase of concern and uncertainty about our collective future. 

On the other hand, i) The unprecedented pressure of the financial markets unveiled the fragilities that resulted from an incomplete construction of the economic and monetary union; ii) The emergence of new great powers - both in Eurasia and Latin America - together with the strategic reorientation of the United States of America (USA) had security implicationsÂ«, potentially changing the current regional balances of power; iii) The new strategic concept of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), approved in 2010, and the new European Union (EU) treaty - the Treaty of Lisbon - created new requirements for the Portuguese contribution to international security. Furthermore, Portugal had to request international financial aid and has been subjected to severe budgetary limitations for some years to come, which has had an impact, namely, on security and national defence.

I. **INTRODUCTION** 
9 
In this context, it has become imperative to review the national defence strategic concept as a key national response instrument to the new security environment. 

The national defence strategic concept requires a national strategy that is credible and that mobilises the Portuguese people. It is based upon the principle that all institutions, state and civil society, contribute to the achievement of the national security and defence goals. 

Therefore, the **national defence strategic concept defines the fundamental aspects of a comprehensive state strategy in the pursuit of the national security and defence policy goals.** 
This emphasizes the need for a comprehensive vision of the national strategy, including a conceptual approach concerning the fundations that make it coherent: the power and the will; the mobilisation of material and non-material resources.

## Ii. Fundamentals Of The National Security And Defence Strategy

In a globalised world, the quality of the national strategy is crucial for the survival of a modern state and an open society. A good strategy requires clearly defined values and interests, a solid will to defend them, so that those clear goals can be legitimised and effectively pursued. National values and interests are defined by the National Constitution and by the National Defence Law. They produce international commitments for the state, namely the United Nations Charter, the North Atlantic Treaty and the EU treaties. 

These **fundamental values are:** national independence, the primacy of the national interest, the defence of the principles of Portuguese democracy and of human rights and international law, the commitment to defend European, Atlantic and international stability and security. 

Portugal's interests are: to assert its presence in the world, to consolidate its participation in a solid network of alliances, to defend the state's external stand and credibility, to value the Portuguese communities abroad, and to contribute to the promotion of peace and international security. 

The national interests derived from Portugal's status as a European and Atlantic democracy - with a universal vocation but limited resources - requires Portugal's participation in a stable and coherent network of alliances. The EU and NATO are therefore vital for national security and defence and for Portugal's modernisation and prosperity. The national interests call for greater cohesion and solidarity within the EU and NATO, an enhanced strategic partnership between these two organisations and also between Europe and the USA. Portugal's interest is also inseparable from the strengthening of the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries (CPLP). 

Additionally, it is important to deepen or establish bilateral strategic partnerships with other members of the European and Western community, with the Lusophone space and also with the Maghreb and with emerging powers. 

![12_image_0.png](12_image_0.png)

In the pursuit of these national values and interests, the following are **essential elements of the national strategy:** 
- **The Portuguese diplomacy, to implementhis strategy in its international dimension.** 
Diplomacy is indispensable for the external action of the state and for Portugal's international standing. It also contributes to national economic recovery by promoting trade and securing foreign investment. 

Portugal's international standing, credibility and the reinforcement of its external negotiating ability further require that three key elements be valued: the Portuguese language and culture; the diaspora and emigrants; and the definition and consolidation of policies and strategies of national image and branding. - **The Portuguese armed forces, to consolidate Portugal's status as a co-provider of international** security. The security forces and services also contribute to this aim, as well as the diplomatic service and the judiciary. 

The military assets are a fundamental part of state security and a tool for projecting Portugal's international prestige. 

The national strategy must clearly define the priority missions of the armed forces, the geopolitical priorities of their employment and the capabilities required. At the same time, it should also set the criteria for rationalisation, guaranteeing greater efficiency in the use of resources. 

The new security environment, the new financial conditions and the demands of foreign alliances require a distinct responsiveness of the armed forces. Investments in its modernisation should focus on armament and equipment of irrefutable tactical and strategic usefulness. They must also be selective and judiciously discriminate the armament and equipment to be acquired in view of the capabilities needed to accomplish priority missions. At the same time, it is very important to define a comprehensive civil-military strategy, which is essential to face current threats and risks.

- **Promotion of Portuguese prosperity through the development of the country's material and** 
non-material capabilities and the reduction of vulnerabilities and dependencies. 

Regarding vulnerabilities, the strategic focus should pay particular attention to the financial, energy, food, demographic, scientific, and technological dimensions. Concerning capabilities, the maximization of resources, and national opportunities requires taking advantage of Portugal's geostrategic position and logistical and economic potential. Furthermore, it requires the continuity of policies and the allocation of resources indispensable to improve scientific and technological innovation capabilities. It is therefore essential to develop scientific and technological capabilities to support relevant research centres and strengthen the country's national educational project through the maximization of knowledge and human capital. Greater proximity between universities, laboratories, centres of excellence, and enterprises is also vital to ensure that knowledge is applied in support of economic and social development. 

- **Restoring sustainable financial stability, economic growth, and employment-are essential to reinforce national security.** In the current context, the economic and financial dimensions have additional importance. Economic risks may jeopardise vital interests of the state, including sovereignty, national independence, and social cohesion. 

So, the following are particularly relevant: i) commitment to sectors linked to the production of tradable goods, namely those associated with exports; ii) a more efficient energy and food production and consumption; iii) better exploitation of mineral and marine resources - the vast maritime zone under national responsibility is one of the most important national assets, which is paramount to enhance, and iv) the development of new industrial and agricultural policies. 

- **Strategic Intelligence, which is decisive for the effective achievement of the country's strategic** 
potential. Enhancing this dimension means prioritising the quality of strategic intelligence, a prospective vision, and the decision-making processes. Accordingly, it is also essential to reinforce the state's capability of strategic action.

# Ill. International Context

## 1. Major Trends

The international system has entered a **transition period,** characterised both by multiplying crises and an increased probability of conflict and turbulence, which allows us to anticipate substantial transformations in the international balance of power and in the security environment of states. This international transition implies growing instability and unpredictability, justifying a careful identification of the scenarios, where national interests can be threatened, and a permanent evaluation of the response mechanisms required to defend them. 

The globalisation process and the technological revolution have enabled the existence of an **unprecedented dynamic of global political, social, economic, and cultural integration.** It created a framework of increased interdependence, a strong trend for homogenisation and new conditions of progress. But it also facilitated an equally easy diffusion of threats and risks in all dimensions, including the transnational projection of terrorist networks and organised crime, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, the weakening of states, and the destructive potential of cyber-attacks. The international financial and economic crisis, which was the largest of the last decades, has made these threats and risks even more complex and difficult to address. 

The strategic dimensions of the international changes create new challenges to the preponderance of the USA, expressed in a review of its priorities, namely towards the Pacific region. The evolution in the international economic and financial balance, and the institutionalisation of the "Group of 20" 
(G20) represents the recognition of the emergence of new powers such as China, India and Brazil. 

Asia's growing strategic importance may anticipate a change in the balance between the main regions of the international system. The succession of situations of political rupture and transition, while bringing in the medium term the prospects for democratic legitimisation and stability, could in the short term generate fault lines in the strategic balances, and geopolitical tensions, which 

![16_image_0.png](16_image_0.png)

Ill. **INTERNATIONAL CONTEXT** 
17 
At the same time the **diffusion of power,** the proliferation of programmes of weapons of mass destruction, the development of new military technologies and the dissemination of asymmetrical conflicts - guerrilla warfare and terrorism - have changed the framework of regional and global security, and have allowed states, groups or organisations with few resources easier access to lethal technologies. These power levellers make the use of violence more unpredictable and the guarantee of international peace and security more complex. The multiplication of fragile states often leads to the collapse of state authority in large territories, leads to ethnic and religious conflicts, civil wars and secession ism, as well as to prolonged and violent conflicts, whose resolution continues to partly escape the traditional mechanisms of international intervention. 

## 2. Contexts Of Regional Security 2.1. Europe And The European Union

As a whole, the European Union remains the world's richest region, with a social model that has provided unique standards of living to its population. However, an ageing population, weak economic growth and internal tensions, aggravated by the economic and financial crises, could endanger regional stability. The fragmentation of the financial markets is testing both European solidarity, implicit in a single market and a single currency, and its integration process. The evolution of the crisis will affect the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP). Reversing the European crisis requires not only unity and internal cohesion of the EU, the institutional reforms necessary to restore economic and financial stability, and a realistic international strategy to ensure its capability to guarantee regional stability and contribute to international security. 

Ill. INTERNATIONAL CONTEXT **~C,** ~ 

![17_image_0.png](17_image_0.png)

## 2.2. The United States Of America And Transatlantic Relations

The USA and Europe are key strategic partners, notably within the framework of NATO. Their alliance is essential not only to the transatlantic security, but also for the stability of the international order. 

In the USA, the financial crisis and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan contributed to high budget deficits, making it a priority to strengthen the US economy in order to preserve America's international preponderance. The review of US external priorities includes strengthening its traditional alliances and the transatlantic community. This also demands that the European allies assume additional responsibilities, both for their own security and defence, and for their contribution to international security. Together with their north-american ally, Portugal and Europe should safeguard the crucial dimension of the transatlantic axis, in order to guarantee complementarity of actions and efforts worldwide. 

## 2.3. North Africa And Middle East

North Africa and Middle East are essential regions for the EU external projection. It is essential to underline the importance of Europe's southern border and neighbourhood in the context of global security and development, both because of their proximity and their energy reserves, and as a region characterised by enormous economic and social challenges. The recent political changes, which could have long-term positive consequences, have aggravated the risks of violence, created new problems of political instability and may degenerate in new political and territorial divisions. The risks of nuclear proliferation persist, as well as some tendencies towards extremism. The conflicts in this region tend to contaminate contiguous spaces, including the Sahel, where an unstable political and social context facilitates the presence of terrorist groups, and the development of links between all sorts of illegal trafficking. Attaining an effective cooperation and development policy in bilateral and multilateral frameworks may be decisive for the evolution of the situation in the region. In this regard, particular attention should be given to the conclusion of new-generation trade and political agreements between the EU and countries more interested and open to reforms following the "Arab Spring".

## 2.4. Sub-Saharan Africa

Sub-Saharan Africa has both the poorest populations and the least developed economies in the world, as well as vast human and natural resources, which indicate strong potential for growth. However, Africa has many recent states with historically weak borders where separatist trends have emerged. Consequently, the presence of fragile or failed states has security implications, with particular relevance to the phenomena of terrorism and piracy, but also to organised crime, associated to all kinds of transnational traffic and to pandemics. 

Nevertheless, there are also positive trends in terms of security, which must be highlighted and supported. These include the existence of pluralist democracies, the consolidation of multilateral structures, and the development of the African Union and its regional security dimension. Both bilaterally and within the international and the European Union framework, Portugal should help promote regional processes of economic and political integration. 

## 2.5. The Atlantic

The Atlantic is an area of stability and security in international politics. In the North Atlantic, western democracies form a unique security community, which constitutes a centre of stability that is essential to the international order. The western alliance is a guarantor of international strategic stability. 

Western democracies are a reference of freedom, rule of law and respect for human rights and other guarantees, including the protection of minorities and religious tolerance. Western economies are important drivers for modernisation, innovation, and globalisation, and it will be increasingly so as long as the transatlantic partnership develops through negotiations for a free trade area between the EU and the USA. 

In the South Atlantic, democratisation and modernisation processes point to a new reality of peace and progress, together with a capacity to structure multilateral frameworks of regulation and cooperation, paving the way for the consolidation of new security communities. In South America, Brazil is the best symbol of this change. 

The two rims of the South Atlantic have experienced an intense demand for energy, minerals, and food, underlining their geo-economic relevance. The reserves in the Gulf of Guinea and in Angola 

Ill. INTERNATIONAL CONTEXT **~C,** ~ 

![19_image_0.png](19_image_0.png)

and the oil and gas offshore deposits of Brazil represent a counterweight to the traditional centres of power in the international energy system. Besides being a vital area for the flow of raw materials and energy, the Atlantic will be further valorised for being an open ocean. The growing importance of the energy and trade routes emphasises the need for a converging effort between North and South Atlantic coastal countries to guarantee their common security. 

## 2.6. Asia

Asia is a region undergoing accelerated economic growth. The accomplishment of China and India's economic potential transformed their societies and changed the international economic balance. 

The parallel rise of the two major Asian continental powers has led to its recognition as one of the three main international regions. Strategic competition between Asian powers is heightened by the persistence of territorial issues, secessionist movements, and border problems, as well as by fragile states linking this region with the Middle East. 

Two core issues for the future evolution of this region remain unknown. The first is whether or not the trend of strong economic growth will continue, and for how long in view of the impact of the crisis on its exports. The stability and predictability of foreign exchange markets and international trade, as well as sustainable and socially balanced economic growth models, will be key aspects to be taken into account. The second lies in assessing the likelihood of finding peaceful solutions for the critical hotspots in the region. The issue that most matters to the security of NATO member states is the pacification of Afghanistan and Pakistan. The dynamics of this region will continue to have an important impact on global security and prosperity. In short, Portugal is facing a process of international transition in multiple dimensions, involving all strategically relevant regions. The continuity of the Atlantic Alliance and of the EU are essential to ensure minimum conditions of stability for Portugal in a scenario of transformation, given that factors of instability and conflict remain within the international security environment, with consequences that are difficult to foresee and which may unleash situations of risk that may directly or indirectly threaten national interests.

## 3. Threats And Risks

3.1. THREATS AND RISKS IN THE GLOBAL SECURITY ENVIRONMENT 
Ill. **INTERNATIONAL CONTEXT** 
The global security environment confronts, inter alia, the following risks and threats: 
- **Transnational terrorism** and other forms of violent extremism with highly destabilising impact; - **Piracy,** mainly based in fragile states or those with weak control of their territories and affecting key international trade routes; 
- **Organised transnational crime,** including the traffic of persons, weapons, and narcotics, which constitutes a threat to the security of people and goods, with the potential to produce fragile states; - **The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction** (nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological), 
with the added danger that they may be acquired by terrorist groups; 
- **The multiplication of fragile states and civil wars** in key strategic areas, fostering mass atrocities, terrorism, and growing waves of refugees; - **Regional conflicts,** inter alia, as a result of the hegemonic claims of powers in strategic areas with a high degree of conflict or separatism, and with a potential impact on regional and global balances; 
- **Cyberterrorism and cybercrime,** which targets networks that are essential to the economy and the globalised information society; - **The dispute over scarce natural resources,** such as hydrocarbons, minerals, and water may lead to violent struggles over their use and control; 
- **Natural disasters and climate change,** affecting states, societies, and populations without distinction, but with more damaging effects on the most fragile. 

![21_image_0.png](21_image_0.png)

## 3.2. Main Risks And Threats To National Security 3.2.1 Global Threats

Portugal is facing global threats that may directly endanger its security. These include: 
- **Terrorism,** given that the relative ease of access to the territory and the identity of Portugal as a western democracy might make the country a target of international terrorism; 
- **The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction,** which represents a more immediate and worrying threat, in the extent that it could lead to its possession by terrorist groups or could result in serious crises in the regional security of key areas; 
- **Organised transnational crime,** as Portugal's geographical position as an external border of the EU 
and its vast airspace and maritime zone under its jurisdiction impose particular responsibilities; 
- **Cybercrime,** since cyber-attacks are a growing threat to critical infrastructures wherein the potential aggressors (terrorists, organised criminals, states or isolated individuals) can cause the collapse of the technological infrastructure of modern social organisations; 
- **Piracy,** not only because of food and energy dependence and the importance of maritime transportation for the national economy, but also because of increased national responsibilities in the cooperative security of the global commons. 

## Ill. International Context

## 3.2.2 Environmental Risks

The degradation and scarcity of drinking water, the loss of arable land, the decline in the production of food, and the increasing frequency of environmental catastrophes may lead to mass migrations and enormous economic losses. The competition for scarce natural resources, namely water and energy, has a high destabilising potential, which could lead to situations of violence and armed conflict. 

In the last decade, natural catastrophes have raised awareness of the fact that states could be confronted with sudden and massive destruction of wealth and with the occurrence of large-scale humanitarian disasters, requiring the solidarity of the international community. 

Portugal is subject to the same environmental risks and must improve its ability to prevent, adaptat and respond rapidly to the following challenges: - **Climate change,** environmental and seismic risks, which, given their destructive effects and their potentially prolonged impact, could seriously affect the capability of states, societies and economies to function normally and safely; 
- **The occurrence of heat and cold waves** with potential effects on morbidity and mortality rates; - **Risks to land and marine ecosystems,** such as pollution, the abusive use of marine resources, and forest fires; 
- **Pandemics and other sanitary risks,** which could create not only a substantial number of victims but also cause added security problems as a result of the panic they could engender.

# Iv. Portugal In The World

## 1. Strategic Positioning And Areas Of Strategic National Interest

The stable and coherent definition of Portugal's international position as a European and Western democracy made it possible to develop a consistent strategy of integration in the EU and of consolidation of the Portuguese position in NATO, as well to strengthen relations with the Portuguese-speaking countries notably with the creation of CPLP. 

Portugal's international position and the definition of its areas of strategic interest result from a combination of values, interests, geography, and history. The essential values for Portugal's international identity are the constitutional values of democracy, which place the country as an integrant part of the EU and NATO. State interests in the key domains of defence and security, as well as the imperatives of modernisation of the economy and society, confirms its European and western stand. The geography of the national space, defined by the **"strategic triangle"** formed by Portugal's mainland and the archipelagos of Madeira and Azores, enhances our links to Europe and the Atlantic. History has shown Portugal's universalist vocation. Europe is the most important area of strategic national interest. Portugal is Europe's western border on the Atlantic. Democratisation and Europeanization guarantee a vital coherence between the values of Portuguese democracy, the imperatives of national defence, and strategies of modernisation. 

The **North Atlantic** security community is a space of unity between Europe, the USA and Canada. 

Portugal's national unity and territorial integrity, as well as the bilateral alliance with the USA and the cohesion of the Atlantic Alliance, make the Euro-Atlantic space the second most relevant area of permanent strategic interest, whose stability is reinforced by western democracies' community of polit-

![26_image_0.png](26_image_0.png)

IV. PORTUGAL IN THE WORLD 
The **Atlantic** as a whole is a vast area of significant strategic interest. Most of the Portuguese-speaking countries, with which we share a common past and a network of relations through culture, migrations, and economic exchanges, are located in this area. They are important in symbolic terms and also as partners in progress. It is therefore in Portugal's interest to underline the strategic unity of the Atlantic, contribute to its security and strive for the international relevance of this area. 

The Atlantic has been transformed with the democratisation of Latin America and the emergence of new powers in the region. In this new framework, conditions are now in place for democratic convergence in the Atlantic area and for the development of a new identity for the Atlantic, with unique homogeneity and stability. This foreshadows the need for a new transatlantic community to guarantee security, not only of maritime lines of communication, but also of the reserves of energy and raw materials, the importance of which will grow with the future development of the new ocean economy The distribution of the **Portuguese communities** and migratory flows, concentrated in European and Western countries, as well as in Brazil, South Africa, Angola, and Venezuela, confirm the status of Europe, of the Euro-Atlantic space, and of the Atlantic as priority areas of national strategic belonging. 

The **Maghreb** deserves attention because of territorial proximity and economic and cultural relations. Energy dependence and the potential risks of increased demographic pressure in a possible scenario of conflict in the region justify its reconnaissance as an area of relevant strategic interest. 

Lastly, Portugal cannot ignore the transformations in **Asia** and should look for strategic partnerships that best meet the external projection of its interests. 

In short, at the start of the twenty-first century, a member of the EU, NATO, and CPLP, Portugal is at the centre of the transatlantic community and is a natural link in the relations between Western Europe, North America, South America, and Southern Africa regions, with whom a deepening relationship is to be sought. 

This reality enhances Portugal's strategic relevance, but it also means that we must be ready to actively contribute to the stability and progress of all the areas where the promotion of our strategic interests is at stake. 

IV. PORTUGAL IN THE WORLD ~ ~

## 2. Cooperative Security

Portuguese national interests determine its strategy of defence of a multilateral system, in the international order, and its status as a member of the United Nations, the EU, and NATO. That is the best way to guarantee a relevant presence in international politics and a maximum of security for Portugal. 

Portuguese democracy has been an effective actor within a framework of cooperative security. It is engaged in the evolution and reform of those organisations and with the new commitments resulting from their processes of doctrinal revision, in which it took a relevant part. 

The **United Nations** continues to be the ultimate legitimising institution for the use of force. Portugal's participation in the Security Council created new opportunities and obligations as a security provider that strengthen national political credibility. At the Lisbon Summit in 2010, **NATO** approved a new strategic concept. The document advocates the idea of a Comprehensive Approach, with the articulation of civilian and military means in response to security challenges, a field in which Portugal has its own doctrine and past experience that should be highlighted. The new strategic concept expresses NATO's determination to deepen relations with its strategic partners, including the EU and Russia. In that regard, the unique and primary importance of the strategic partnership between NATO and the EU was once again underlined, as was the fundamental importance of the bilateral partnership between NATO and Russia for European stability. Following the Lisbon Summit, the concept of Smart Defence was also introduced, with the aim of sustaining technological transformation through smart investments, in order to enhance the Alliance's capabilities to project robust forces in crisis prevention and resolution. 

Within the framework of the Atlantic Alliance command structure reform, it was decided to transfer the command of a naval force - Strike Force NATO - to Portugal, as well as the NATO communications school. The advantages and obligations resulting from this must be taken into account concerning Portugal's participation in this important cooperative security system. 

![28_image_0.png](28_image_0.png)

IV. PORTUGAL IN THE WORLD 
29 
With the Treaty of Lisbon, the EU assumed new responsibilities as a security actor. The CSDP defines a framework of common security and defence interests of the Member States, including mutual defence and solidarity clauses, foreseeing collective actions of mutual assistance, as well as mechanisms of Enhanced Cooperation and Permanent Structured Cooperation. The EU security and defence doctrine is defined in the European Security Strategy of 2003, updated and reinforced in 2008, which underlines the need to improve the coordination of instruments and the EU's capability to act with multiple civilian and military capabilities. The EU's economic and financial crisis has given the European Defence Agency a more relevant role and has also highlighted the need for pooling and sharing capabilities, in order to respond simultaneously to national and European requirements. It is important to move forward with bilateral and multilateral agreements in this area, with clear rules, to guarantee the efficient use of this tool, without affecting the autonomy of the Portuguese armed forces. 

The **United Nations, NATO and the EU** share a fundamental commitment to the principle of ensuring human security, guaranteeing not only the security of the states but also the security of people. 

Similarly, the three organizations share a common determination to improve crisis prevention and management, as well as to ensure better rapid response and better deployment of civilian and military capabilities. 

Portugal acknowledges the transformations resulting from the new security agenda so as to continue to be a responsible partner within the framâ‚¬work of cooperative security and to assure the permanent defence of our fundamental values and interests. 

IV. PORTUGAL IN THE WORLD ~ ~

## 3. Alliances And Partnerships

The main aim of our strategy of alliances is to defend national interests and guarantee Portugal's security and defence, reduce vulnerabilities, fulfil! the state's international responsibilities, and contribute to the achievement of Portugal's vision of the constitutive values of the international order. 

The vital alliance for Portugal's security and defence is the **Atlantic Alliance.** Defending our territorial integrity and national cohesion are inseparable from our participation in NATO. The acknowledgement of Portugal as an international security provider, its participation in overseas military missions and contribution to the security of the global commons takes place mainly within the framework of NATO. The internationalisation and modernisation of the Portuguese armed forces resulted from Portugal's integration in the Atlantic Alliance. The credibility of the military institution and its capability to perform essential national defence missions are inseparable from Portugal's stand as a NATO 
member. The Atlantic Alliance is the institutional core framework for the Euro-Atlantic security community. 

Strengthening bilateral relations with the **USA** is crucial to consolidate Portugal's position in the main geographical areas, where it has priority interests. Relations with the USA are decisive in terms of the military, political, economic, and scientific dimensions and also for the development of the ocean economy. 

Europe is the most important region from the point of view of national strategic interests. Portugal's commitment to full and active participation in the EU is vital for the security and welfare of the Portuguese. The values of Portuguese democracy are accomplished through the constitution of the EU as a rule of law community in the international system. To ensure the imperatives of national security and defence, Portugal must guarantee its position as a party to the Permanent Structured Cooperation, within the framework of the CSDP, by being committed to ensuring the quality of its participation in EU missions and in the programmes of the European Defence Agency. 

Portugal shall be committed to enhancing military cooperation and security programmes within the framework of the **CPLP** and establishing strategic security partnerships to create relevant frameworks of cooperation aimed at defending common interests, namely in the field of security of maritime lines of communication and crisis management. 

![30_image_0.png](30_image_0.png)

IV. PORTUGAL IN THE WORLD 
31 
These partnerships are important to consolidate national autonomy and protect the country's interests and values in areas of strategic interest for Portugal. These initiatives are a way for Portugal to express its commitment to defending the unity of the Atlantic, the consolidation of which is vital, namely to strengthen the ties between the members of the CPLP. Inter-regional relations between Western Europe, North America, South America, and Southern Africa justify the creation of security dialogues, namely between the EU, NATO, the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), and the Southern African Development Community (SADC). 

In the **Maghreb and Middle East,** Portugal must permanently monitor local conditions by strengthening bilateral relations. It is fundamental to give priority to bilateral partnerships with close neighbours sharing common interests, and also to participation in multilateral frameworks, namely the Mediterranean Dialogue, the Istanbul Cooperation Initiative, and the 5+5 Initiative. 

In **Timor Leste,** Portugal's continued commitment to statebuilding and cooperation is not only relevant for bilateral relations, but also for Portugal's prestige in the region. For Portugal, it is important to be able to consolidate and develop partnerships not only with China - in particular through the Special Administrative Region of Macao-, with Japan, and with India, but also with South Korea, Malaysia, Thailand, Sri Lanka and Indonesia, where history laid the foundations for specific relations between Portugal and those Asian nations. This does not exclude other countries in the region, whose relations with Portugal have great potential, namely in the economic dimension. Portugal can and shall seek to combine the recognition by Asiani countries of the specificity of these historic ties with the development of more intense bilateral relations. 

The Portuguese crisis coincides with an European crisis, marked by growing uncertainty about the future of the EU and the fate of the transatlantic community, the twin pillars of the international order, which ensure Portugal's defence as an independent state. In this context, a clear and rigorous definition of Portugal's international position, its national priorities, and its alliances is decisive to contain risks of isolation, marginalisation, and loss of autonomy, unprecedented since the institutionalisation of Portuguese democracy.

## V. National Context 1. National Vulnerabilities And Assets

Portugal is a democracy, is a part of the Western community, and has a geographical position that determines the definition of its permanent interests. 

National capabilities will be improved by the articulation between the strategic instruments available to the state and the use of available resources. in developing actions that allow the state to reach its desired goals. 

Within the framework of the strategic planning process, and aiming at maximising national capabilities, it is important to explore the following **elements of national assets,** due to its multiplying effect over the national strategic potential: history, national identity, and cohesion; culture and linguistic areas; a consolidated democratic regime; membership to the EU, NATO, and CPLP; the sea and its centrality in the Atlantic; the archipelagic nature of the territory; climate, and migrant communities. 

In defining how to use our resources, we should consider first our **main vulnerabilities:** economic and financial imbalances and the level of competitiveness of the economy; an ageing population; energy and food dependence; weaknesses in the justice system and constrains associated to town and country planning. 

The national strategic potential will always depend on the availability of the country's resources. 

However, its real value is derived mostly from the rational and intelligent way these resources are used and the **collective will** that encourages us, as Portuguese, to continue to build a common future, developing an effective national capability for action.

## 2. Principles Of National Security And Defence

National security and defence policies include principles and goals defined in the Constitution and by law, as well as guidelines and priorities defined by the strategic concept, which are specified inter alia in each government's programme. 

National security and defence policies are guided by the promotion of **national interests:** through the reinforcement of its presence in the world and the consolidation of its participation in international alliances; through the safeguard of Portugal's external reputation and credibility; by enhancing the role of the Portuguese communities abroad; and through the contribution to the promotion of peace and human security, based upon the primacy of international law. 

The **fundamental principles** of national security and defence policies are as follows: national independence; equality among states; protection of human rights; respect for internationalaw; peaceful resolution of international conflicts; and contribution to international security, stability and peace. 

The state defends its national interests through all legitimate means, at home and abroad, in the maritime zones under national sovereignty or jurisdiction and in the airspace for which it is responsible. The state ensures the protection of the life and interests of the Portuguese in an autonomous or multinational framework. When exercising the right of legitimate defence, Portugal reserves the prerogative to resort to war in cases of attack or imminent aggression. 

The effective implementation of the national strategy is guided by three rules: 
- **Strategic unity:** essential to integrate all the dimensions of security and defence, bound by common goals; - **Coordination:** indispensable to assure cooperation and colaboration between all the entities and bodies involved, at the national or multilateral level, in order to maximise the available strategic potential; 
- **Rational and effective use of resources:** is imperative when deciding how best to use available tools, bearing in mind the aim to which they are to contribute to and the nature of the threats and risks to be mitigated.

## 3. National Permanent Goals

Portugal is a pluralist democracy, ruled by law, and an integral part of the Western community. The Portuguese are an old European nation with a strong identity and deep confidence in their national destiny. Within the framework of national security and defence policies, these are the **permanent goals** to be guaranteed: - The sovereignty of the state, national independence, territorial integrity, and the fundamental values of the constitutional order; - Freedom and security of the populations and their assets, and the protection of national heritage; 
- Freedom of action of the entities composing the sovereign state, the normal functioning of democratic institutions, and the state's ability to fulfil all its essential functions and tasks; 
- Peace maintenance or re-establishment, according to national interests; 
- Strengthening the cohesion enhancing capabilities of the national community, enabling it to prevent or react to any external aggression or threat by .adequate means.

## 4. Conjunctural National Goals

The definition of permanent goals is nevertheless not detailed enough to define strategic action. As a result of the analysis of the security environment and the role Portugal aspires to have in the world, it is important to identify concrete and up-to-date political goals to enable a consistent strategic planning formulation. Within the framework of national security and defence policies, the **conjunctural goals** are defined as: 
- To correc the economic and financial imbalances in order to restore external credibility and preserve social cohesion, at the same time reinforcing the country's autonomy and external action capability; 
- To reduce unemployment, contributing to social cohesion and better quality of life for citizens and their families; 
- To correct vulnerabilities and external dependence that are damaging to national cohesion and sovereignty; - To promote Portugal's Atlantic vocation; 
- To consolidate Portugal's inclusion in a stable and coherent network of strategic alliances and partnerships; 
- To commit to the consolidation of the CPLP; - To develop the capacity to confront the most likely threats and risks, and to fulfil our international commitments, including the relevant role of the armed forces in international peace missions; 
- To ensure the rational and profitable use of resources by developing integrated civilian-military capabilities;

![39_image_0.png](39_image_0.png)

## Vi. National Strategic Action Concept

The national strategy is developed according to three axes of action: exercising national sovereignty, neutralising threats and risks to national security; overcoming the main national constraints and vulnerabilities; enhancing national resources and exploring existing opportunities. The **strategic action** 
combines various lines of action comprehending the articulation or independent implementation by the various agents, involved directly or indirectly, that contribute to the pursuit of the state's permanent and medium term national goals. 

## 1. Axes And Strategic Lines Of Action (I) - Exercising Sovereignty, Neutralising Threats And Risks To National Security

1.1. Defending Portugal's international stand Portugal has a stable international status as a Western democracy, full member of the EU and NATO, 
and a founding state of CPLP. The permanent interests of Portuguese foreign policy are well defined and based on a national consensus. 

Diplomacy and foreign policy are essential to pursue national strategic goals in international relations. The prioritary lines of action to **defend Portugal's international** stand include: 
- Contributing to the stabilisation and the accomplishment of the Economic and Monetary Union and strengthening the EU common policies, such as the CSDP, in which Portugal must continue to be an active and committed partner; 
- Reaffirming the strategic importance of Portugal's NATO membership and also of bilateral relations with the USA; 

![40_image_0.png](40_image_0.png)

VI. NATIONAL STRATEGIC ACTION CONCEPT 
- Contributing to the security of the Maghreb, notably through the 5+5 Initiative and other multilateral forums; - Actively participating in missions contributing to international peace and security within the context of the international organisations to which is bound; 
- Intensifying relations with countries hosting Portuguese communities, countries with a strong cultural Portuguese presence, and all countries with immigrant communities in Portugal; 
- Effectively engage Portuguese diplomacy, notably to project the country in the global economy, through economic diplomacy, to contribute decisively to promote Portugal's external credibility, attract foreign investment, and defend Portuguese companies abroad; 
- Reinforcing the presence of Portuguese nationals in international organisations; 
- Developing strategies of national branding, involving inter alia, a strategic plan outline, professional management of public diplomacy policy, and by associating private entrepreneurship and the Portuguese diaspora to those initiatives.

## 1.2. Consolidating External Defence Relations

Strengthening national security and defence depends on the **consolidation of external defence relations,** notably with NATO and the EU, and also on furthering security cooperation within the community of Portuguese-speaking countries, which will imply the following lines of action: 
- Participate in international military peace missions, in the framework of United Nations, NATO, and EU; - Foster relations with NATO, taking part in its transformation process and defending the strategic partnership between NATO and the EU; 
- Reinforce external defence relations and cooperation with the USA; - Promote the development of the EU's CSDP; - Expande bilateral and multilateral security and defence relations with CPLP member states, inter alia, in technical and military cooperation and Security Sector Reform domains; - Contribute to the strategic stability of the Mediterranean and Maghreb, actively participating in the 5+5 Initiative; - Enhance opportunities in defence economics. 

## 1.3. Enhance Strategic Intelligence

The unpredictable, multifaceted, and transnational nature of new threats confirms the relevance of intelligence. In this context, intelligence agencies are indispensable instruments in identifying and assessing threats and opportunities in volatile and complex scenarios. Intelligence is a strategic asset of the state, essential to the decision-making process, especially concerning security and defence issues. Given the current context, the necessary protection of national interests in various regions will, in the coming years, be one of the main and most demandling state attributions, requiring the mandatory reinforcement of its intelligence services capabilities. 

Consequently, the **valorisation of strategic intelligence** involves the following steps; 

![42_image_0.png](42_image_0.png)

VI. NATIONAL STRATEGIC ACTION CONCEPT 
- Consolidating intelligence as a tool to assess and identify opportunities, threats, vulnerabilities, and risks; 
- Strengthening intelligence as an instrument to identify opportunities for the promotion of Portuguese presence, which contributes to national security, taking advantage of non-material capabilities and values, such as language, culture, democracy, and human rights. 

## 1.4. Adapting National Security And Defence Policies To The Strategic Environment

1.4.1 DEFEND TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY AND THE SECURITY OF CITIZENS, NEUTRALISE TRANSNATIONAL THREATS AND RISKS 
The defence of constitutional values, sovereignty assurance, national independence, and territorial integrity, the security of citizens and individual and political freedoms are permanent functions and duties of a democratic state. 

To ensure these permanent goals, national security and defence policies must: 
- Ensure a deterrent capability required to discourage aggressions or to restore peace in accordance to national interest, and strengthened by the framework of alliances; 
- Consolidate the military structure as an essential tool to demonstrate the state's defensive capability and collective determination to exercise national sovereignty; 
- Ensure the capability to fulfil military missions indispensable to guarantee the state' sovereignty, national independence, and territorial integrity; - Efficiently articulate civilian and military assets to guarantee an integrated response capability to aggressions or threats to national security; 
- Guarantee the national territory and inter-territorial space surveillance and control capability, including the surveillance of the airspace and sea; 

VI. NATIONAL STRATEGIC ACTION CONCEPT **~C,** ~ 

![43_image_0.png](43_image_0.png)

- Guarantee autonomous capability to execute missions to protect the lives and the interests of Portuguese citizens; - Ensure the indispensable strategic reserves to the country's security, such as energy, communications, transport, supplies, food, and health domains; 
- Guarantee the capacity to organise national resistance in case of aggression. 

## 1.4.2. Respond To Threats And Risks

The transnational threats typology such as terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, organised crime, cybercrime, catastrophes and calamities, environmental risks and pandemics requires integrated multi-dimensional strategic responses. In this regard the state must: 
- Maximise existing civilian and military capabilities and encourage an integrated approach in response to threats and risks, setting an effective **national crisis management system;** 
- Clarify, streamline and simplify preventive and operational response structures, adapting them to the nature of the threats, in order to maximise existing capabilities and improve the efficient use of means; 
- Contribute, at the international level, to strengthing the policies of arms control and non-proliferation and their mass destruction technologies, to preventing and fighting terrorism, drug trafficking, and other forms of organised crime, to protecting the environment, and contributing to air and maritime security, and humanitarian aid; 
- Reinforce the **cooperation between the armed forces and the security forces and services** in missions to fight transnational aggressions and threats through an Operational Cooperation Plan, including not only coordination measures, but also systems and equipment interoperability; 

![44_image_0.png](44_image_0.png)

VI. NATIONAL STRATEGIC ACTION CONCEPT 
45 
- Promote an integrated **internal security** approach, both with an horizontal dimension, including the need for articulated and coordinated intervention of the security forces and services, civil protection, medical emergency, and judicial authorities, as well as actors from the private sector, and avertical dimension, including international, national, and local levels; 
- Promote the operational integration of internal security by adopting operational measures that can reduce redundancies and increase operational integration and system resilience, including intelligence, public security, criminal investigation, border control, and civil protection; 
- Develop the necessary military capabilities to mitigate the consequences of terrorist, cybernetic, bacteriological, nuclear, chemical, and radiological attacks (NBCR) and also of catastrophes and calamities; 
- Define a coordinated plan to acquire and maintain **strategic reserves** of certain medication to be used in emergency public health or calamity cases, and also ensure, in a sustainable way, the continuous preservation of essential infrastructures for public health, including the public care system, and the supply of water, food and energy. 

To respond effectively to the threat of terrorist networks, Portugal must develop an integrated national strategy articulating diplomacy, financial control, judicial, public information, police and military intelligence measures. It must also attach particular importance to surveillance and control of air, land and sea access to the national territory. In this field, implementing a National Programme for the Protection of Critical Infrastructures is also vital. 

Regarding the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and its delivery systems, it is essential to reinforce coordination between the various departments of the state responsible for prevention and responce to this threat. This should be made, namely, through the supervision of markets with access to production, trade, and traffic, technological research, public information, and civil protection, in close cooperation with our allies. It is also important to improve NBCR defence capabilities. 

VI. NATIONAL STRATEGIC ACTION CONCEPT ~ ~ 

![45_image_0.png](45_image_0.png)

Fighting **transnational organised crime** involves not only strengthening international cooperation but also improving the capability to prevent and fight against organised crime. This should be made by strengthening and improving the coordination mechanisms between the various entities and institutions responsible for this domain, whether with particular priority to surveillance, detection, and tracking of drug trafficking in air and maritime areas under national jurisdiction or by fighting illegal immigration networks and the traffic of human beings. 

Regarding **cybercrime,** we must assess the vulnerabilities of the information systems and of the multiple vital infrastructures and services that they support. In this field, the priority lines of action are: to guarantee the protection of critical infrastructures by creating a National Information Infrastructure Protection System (NIIPS); to define a National Cybersecurity Strategy; to establish the structure responsible for cybersecurity by creating the necessary technical bodies; to raise awareness of public and private operators regarding the critical nature of IT security and set up national cyber defence capability. 

To cope with **threats against the ecosystem,** Portugal should reinforce its response capability by promoting appropriate coordination between relevant public policies in this domain and by maximising civil and military capabilities. 

Piracy constitutes a serious threat to security, affecting key routes of international trade. Portugal must continue to participate in missions to fight piracy, within the framework of its alliances, and contribute to the security of the global commons and its resources, as well as to cooperate with the Portuguese-speaking countries, in particular within the scope of the CPLP Defence Agreement, to develop actions to promote maritime security and fight against this threat. 

The devastating impact of **natural or man-made catastrophes** and **calamities** gives relevance to the Civil Protection System, and in order to improve the system's effectiveness and efficiency, the following strategic lines of action shoud be: reinforcing the Civil Protection System, intensifying the ability to harness operational synergies between the entities responsible for internal security, justice, national defence, and local administration; developing methodologies, programmes, and technical and scientific studies about the various menaces, threats, and risks; creating a Military Emergency Aid Unit, without increasing the number of authorised personne,1 and by improving the armed forces capacity to react, in cooperation with the network of institutions responsible for situations of catastrophy and calamity. 

![46_image_0.png](46_image_0.png)

VI. NATIONAL STRATEGIC ACTION CONCEPT 
Pandemics and other risks to health safety are serious risks for state and people security. In this framework, reinforcing national response capability to health risks by improving strategic planning and response is a priority; to promote education and training initiatives regarding emergency and risk management; developing civil-military cooperation and coordination between public, private, and military hospitals to provide a faster and more effective response to epidemic diseases or attacks by NBCR weapons. Public health security also involves food safety, namely food and water quality, and defining a National Health-Epidemiological Strategy. 

Finally, a National Environmental Strategy is required to prevent and respond, in an integrated way, to the main environmental risks in Portugal, including earthquakes, forest fires, floods, coastline erosion, and soil hydric erosion, desertification, and industrial hazzards. 

## 1.4.3 Promoting Portugal As An International Security Provider

The military dimension is key to support foreign policy. One of the priority missions of the armed forces, as a state instrument, is to contribute to international security, namely by participating in international military missions, ensuring that Portugal is recognised externally as an international security provider. Together with diplomacy, justice, and health sectors, inter alia, the security forces and services play a relevant role in this field. 

The national security boundaries extend beyond the traditional state territorial borders. Reducing factors of global instability and regional conflicts is a collective responsibility of democracies, and an integral part of national security missions. In this regard, Portugal must: - **Take part in international military missions** to defend peace and security, namely within the framework of the United Nations, NATO and the EU, integrating developments in those organisations into national planning; 
- Whenever possible and in accordance with our capabilities, take part in emergency humanitarian aid missions, upon request by the United Nations; - Take part in security sector reform missions; 

## 47

VI. NATIONAL STRATEGIC ACTION CONCEPT ~ ~ 

![47_image_0.png](47_image_0.png)

- Establish strategic partnerships with the **Portuguese-speaking countries,** open to joint initiatives in the field of security and defence, in particular, fight organised crime, cybercrime, and provision of security to sea lines of communication (SLOC); - Increase the efforts already taking place in the area of **technical military cooperation.** Bearing in mind resources available and context, the use of national military resources should comply with a **geopolitical scale of priorities.** Firstly, cooperating in the defence of peace and security in the European and Euro-Atlantic regions, together with our allies, as well as protecting Portuguese communities abroad; secondly, in geographical key areas, to fight transnational terrorism and other direct threats to the Euro-Atlantic region; thirdly, cooperating in the field of security and defence with the Portuguese-speaking countries; and, finally, participating in United Nations emergency aid missions. 

## 1.4.4. Promoting Public Interest Missions Of The Armed Forces

The missions that are constitutionally attributed to the armed forces include public interest missions, notably in support of sustainable development and improved quality of life of the Portuguese people. These missions cover a wide range of activities including: support for the National Civil Protection Service in order to cope with situations of public catastrophe or calamity; support in meeting the basic needs of the populations; surveillance of the Economic Exclusive Zone; search and rescue; environmental protection; defending the natural heritage and preventing fires; research on natural resources and in the fields of geography, cartography, hydrography, oceanography, and the marine environment. When executing these missions the dual use principle should be promoted as broadly as possible. 

## 1.4.5. Adapting And Rationalising Structures

Structural changes within the security environment and the nature of the threats to national security imply a different response-capability by the armed forces. The imperative need to reform the armed forces is not conjunctural. The financial constraints affecting the Western world, and in Portugal in particular, have just made this more urgent. 

![48_image_0.png](48_image_0.png)

VI. NATIONAL STRATEGIC ACTION CONCEPT 
49 
It is vital that this structural change matches a strategic vision. Reforms should obey a coherent model based on the promotion of joint integrated solutions and on operational output, the ultimate justification for the existence of the armed forces. This is the starting point for a process that cannot fail to integrate force planning processes and the building-up of capabilities; simplifying organisational structures; rationalising the territorial setting of the armed forces' units; sharing operational solutions, and eliminating unnecessary redundancies. 

The **main joint nature of the armed forces performance** should apply not only to operational concepts, doctrine, and procedures, but also to the armed forces' institutional and organisational culture. The need for effective decision-making and efficient resource management makes the reform of national defence and armed forces organizational structures inevitable. This requires greater integration of command and management structures, of administrative and logistical bodies and services, resulting from a guiding principle and an operational practice that privilege joint action. 

The need to rationalise and optimise the relation between operational output and resources is imperative within a framework of financial constraints, not only at national and European level but also in NATO, where the objective of implementing the principle of "Smart Defence" gained consensus. 

Regarding the organization of the Ministry of National Defence, the General Staff of the Armed Forces and the Services, forstering the reform should aim at: a functional organisation corresponding to a global vision of national defence; streamline and reduce the organizational structure to simplify and eliminate unnecessary elements, improving functioning of bodies and services in charge of obtaining, allocating, and managing the resources for the armed forces, in particular those related with the preparation and employment of its operational component. The **territorial setting of the armed forces units** must be rationalised in accordance with the guiding principle of concentration, leading to resource savings, maximizing logistic support, and limiting the number of infrastructures, selecting those deemed as the most appropriate. It is important to maximize the practices of **dual use** and shared resources and eliminate every form of duplication of public expenditure. Finally, it is important to rationalise and re-dimension personnel and adapt human resources to the demands of flexibility, which characterize the new missions of the armed forces. 

VI. NATIONAL STRATEGIC ACTION CONCEPT ~ ~ 

![49_image_0.png](49_image_0.png)

## 1.4.6. Maximising Means And Capabilities

In a context of budget constraints, common to EU and NATO members states, one must better define deterrent capabilities, priority missions, and probable scenarios of employment, according to national goals and international commitments. 

Portugal must have a **deterrence capability** to discourage aggressions and to assure the timely functioning of the political, diplomatic, and military restraint mechanisms inherent to the responsibilities of collective defence within the framework of the alliances to which belongs. 

The armed forces must stand as a military instrument capable of projecting joint high-readiness forces, based on a modular concept, with capabilities that allow autonomous engagement or integrated into multinational forces and in support of civil protection. With this purpose, they must be prepared to perform the following **missions:** - Integrated national territorial defence; 
- Response to international crises or armed conflicts according to the assumed commitments, notably with NATO and the EU; 
- Peace support and humanitarian aid, according to national foreign policy and the safeguard of national interests; 
- Technical and military cooperation; - Public interest missions, related to sustainable development, the well-being of the population, support for civil protection and international commitments in that framework; - Cooperation with the security forces and services on fighting transnational threats. 

![50_image_0.png](50_image_0.png)

VI. NATIONAL STRATEGIC ACTION CONCEPT 
51 
The **scenarios** where these missions take place make clear the need for the Portuguese armed forces to primarily have deployment capabilities in order to take part in missions within the framework of cooperative security or in an autonomous framework- to protect Portuguese communities abroad in crisis and conflict areas - to carry out surveillance and control of the sovereign spaces and those under national jurisdiction; and to intervene in case of complex emergencies, namely in situations of natural catastrophe or public calamity. 

Consequently, the **force structure** must primarily consider the type of missions carried out in such scenarios and the existing military capabilities should be optimised and articulated in order to materialise joint capabilities and effective force goals allowing greater responsiveness and readiness. 

The lessons learned in the last two decades, through the participation of the armed forces in international missions, has unequivocally demonstrated the importance of the capability to project and sustain forces over long periods of time, and also the capability for joint actions. It is therefore essential to give priority to a force structure based on joint capabilities, structured on a modular but flexible organisational model. 

The force structure and its territorial setting must be properly dimensioned and reconfigured according to the **level of ambition** to be defined by the government at the start of the planning cycles and with the corresponding priority force goals. All capability planning must be oriented to that level of ambition. Bearing in mind the armed forces missions' typology and the threats to national security, greater priority should be attributed to the following capabilities: deploy and sustain forces over long periods of time; strategic and tactical mobility and force protection; effective capability in the areas of command, control, communications, and intelligence; development of cyber defence capabilities; force enablers that will increase troops operational capability and survival; assets to improve capabilities for surveillance and control of air and sea spaces for which Portugal are responsible and of indispensable capabilities to deal with terrorist attacks, NBCR, and catastrophes and calamities. The success of priority missions also requires a skilled intelligence system, geared to support military operations. Consequently, a strategy of means must first address this list of capabilities. 

VI. NATIONAL STRATEGIC ACTION CONCEPT ~ ~ 

![51_image_0.png](51_image_0.png)

The foregoing corresponds to a modernisation effort with regard to Portugal's obligations managing global commons, in the EU/CSDP, and in the security of the Atlantic. These are strategic challenges that represent opportunities and require investments. 

In this regard it is vital to implement decisively a **capability-based planning process,** in the context of the development of the national force structure, considering the criteria for action and effective employment of armed forces assets, preparation, and efficiency. Investments must be oriented towards the required capabilities to accomplish prioritary national defence missions. These must be selective and focused on equipment of tactical and strategic utility that can guarantee significant operational results at lower costs. 

The shared capability programs under debate in NATO and the EU, as well as a rigorous linkage of national military planning and programming with NATO and EU planning cycles, must be taken into account without affecting the armed forces' capability for autonomous action in specific scenarios. 

The response to the current context of threat and risks make it essential to take into account the indispensable growth capacity of the force system, when necessary, by summoning or mobilization. It is therefore essential to implement an **effective summoning or mobilization system,** as well as to increase the appropriate war reserves. 

In short, bearing in mind the permanent objective of a credible deterrence capability, it is prioritary to consolidate the Portuguese armed forces as a modular, flexible, and modern organisation, enhancing joint capabilities, and optimising the operational output, adapting them to the new security and financial environments. This will imply solutions to rationalise the force structure and its territorial setting, according to the guidelines herein defined. 

In this regard is it also essential to ensure a **more balanced relationship** between the budget expenditure components, namely between expenses with personnel, operation and maintenance, and investment. 

![52_image_0.png](52_image_0.png)

VI. NATIONAL STRATEGIC ACTION CONCEPT 

## 1.4.7. Clarifying The Competences Of The Security Forces And Services

The internal security system should not be considered in isolation but rather as an integrated system in the broader and more-inclusive system of national security, advocating the principles of complementarity and interdependence between all its components. 

To pursue its activity, the internal security system has a number of forces and services that work in this field, in addition to the criminal police. The Portuguese internal security system may be included in the so-called dualist model or dual police component. However, it is important to recognise the need to clarify this conceptual model, by detailing the attributions and competences of each component and by eliminating existing duplications, in order to make the system more effective. 

## 2. Axes And Strategic Lines Of Action (Ii) - Countering National Vulnerabilities 2.1. Promoting Financial Balance And Economic Growth

One of the greatest weaknesses in the national structures has been the enduring external commercial imbalance, which has recently begun to be corrected. However, the structural deficit in the balance of trade has made Portugal dependent on foreign resources to finance itself. In the last years, this problem was exacerbated by the accumulation of other macroeconomic imbalances, namely the frequent deficit of public accounts. This situation had also an impact on the low level of economic growth and on the rise of unemployment, which by its nature undermines the foundations of national cohesion and, when above a certain threshold, can generate conflict and social instability. 

In this domiain the following strategic lines of action are identified: 
- Ensuring macroeconomic stability and the economy's main financial balances, thus assuring the sustainability of public accounts; 
- Raising production and industrial potential, removing the blockages that hinder economic efficiency; 

VI. NATIONAL STRATEGIC ACTION CONCEPT ~ ~ 

![53_image_0.png](53_image_0.png)

- Promoting job creation; - Ensuring a balanced territorial economic development in order to reinforce national and social cohesion; 
- Devoting particular attention to strategically relevant sectors, in order to guarantee maximum national autonomy without sacrifiying economic efficiency and the ability for creating well-being; 
- Creating strategic reserves of essential assets - energy and food - that guarantee the necessary autonomy in critical periods; 
- Creating and diversifying mechanisms that are likely to guarantee vital supplies, in order to improve the national resilience capability in case of conflict; 
- Ensuring the internal financial rebalancing and reducing foreign debt, in order to restore external credibility; 
- Reinforcing international connectivity, by promoting the Atlantic coastline through the development of deep-sea ports, road, and sea transportation, and a rail freight corridor to Europe. 

## 2.2. Ensuring Energy And Food Autonomy

Given their strategic importance, two vulnerabilities stand out energy and food dependence. Strategic action in these fields should involve the pursuit of the following strategic lines of action: 
- Reducing Portugal's energy dependence from abroad and bringing it closer to the EU average 
(50%); 
- Diversifying the sources of energy supplies and routes; 
- Putting into effect a policy of energy efficiency and focusing on the country's endogenous resources by promoting competitive clusters in the area of renewable energies, in particular, wind, solar and biomass; 

![54_image_0.png](54_image_0.png)

- Optimising water resources; 
- Reviewing transport policy, a sector that is responsible for more than one-third of the consumption of primary energy and that is heavily dependent on oil; 
- Reviewing the oil and gas strategic reserves management policy and adapting it to the probability of threats to interrupt energy supply; - Encouraging the potential for producing bio-fuels and promoting an integrated policy to use forest and urban waste to support their transformation into energy resources; 
- Negotiating Portugal's participation in trans-European energy network projects. 

Food safety should involve implementing the following strategic lines of action: 
- Developing national production capabilities in the food sector in order to safeguard its security, reduce external dependence and contribute to national cohesion through rural development and that of the territory as a whole; - Promoting the components associated with agriculture and forestry (trade and services) in all country regions, in order to generate employment and value, contributing to increasing national cohesion; 
- Prevent forest destruction and reinforce the commitment of civil protection agents to its preservation.

----------------

## 2.3. Encouraging Demographic Renewal And Managing Ageing Population

The trend for demographic ageing reduces the possibilities of medium-term economic growth and is insufficiently compensated by the capability to attract immigration, which constitutes in itself a challenge regarding integration and social policies. 

In this regard, the following are strategic lines of action: 
- To promote new birth incentive policies and to fixate population, as well as to consolidate immigrant integration policies; 
- To develop public policies to manage the ageing population, so as to guarantee national cohesion; - To maintain an inclusive and humanist immigration policy that reinforces social cohesion and promotes a culture of citizenship. Likewise, to act at the level of public perceptions, in order to prevent radicalisation and xenophobia. 

## 2.4. Improving The Efficiency Of The Justice System

The national justice system shortfalls are a vulnerability, being identified as one of the causes of our limited global economic stand and as an element that hinders the effective fight against organised crime. 

In this field, the following are strategic lines of action: 
- Implementing the required reforms in the justice system leading to the improvement of international competitiveness which, together with a stable fiscal system and reduced social conflict, represent solid guarantees for investment; 

![56_image_0.png](56_image_0.png)

VI. NATIONAL STRATEGIC ACTION CONCEPT 
- Correcting the existing asymmetries in the penal system, in order to improve efficiency against complex economic crime, including corruption and tax evasion; 
- Introducing the required reforms to ensure efficient fight against organised, economic, cross-border crime, and cybercrime. 

## 2.5. Improve Spatial Planning

Improving spatial planning can make an important contribution to increase security on a territorial-based systemic approach to prevention, mitigation, and adaptation to threats and risks. The lines of action in spatial planning comprehend different levels: 
- Implementing integrated measures that reflect the necessary connection between environmental, food, public health, and spatial planning security, with a view to increasing the security of the territory, communities, and activities, both from a prevention and adaptive risk management perspective, and from a proactive and forward-looking approach to strengthening resilience and sustainability; 
- Linking emergency planning and spatial planning procedures, in order to improve municipal emergency and master plans; - Developing coordinated interventions in particularly vulnerable areas regarding social, economic, and environmental dimensions, where the logics of proximity are decisive in preventing crime and acts of terrorism, as well as social inclusion, environmental, energy, and public health security; 
- Include the necessary requirements for national security and defence in major transport and communications projects and respective infrastructures and means,, inter alia in the vital air and sea links between mainland Portugal and the autonomous regions, as well as with the outside world; - Defining security rules for spatial planning activities that are compatible with national security, namely in major public works. 

VI. NATIONAL STRATEGIC ACTION CONCEPT ~ ~ 

![57_image_0.png](57_image_0.png)

## 2.6. Involving Civil Society In Matters Of National Security And Defence

To assume national security and defence as a key responsibility of the state, but also of society and its citizens. 

In this regard, the strategic lines of action are: 
- Improving the strategic communication of the armed forces to enable the society to better understand national strategic interests and the threats and opportunities it has to deal with; 
- Foster the knowledge and purpose about the military and other available tools to national security and defence strategy among citizens. 

## 3. Axes And Strategic Lines Of Action (111)-Promoting National Resources And Opportunities 3.1. Investing In Maritime Resources

Portugal has a specific geographical position of intercontinental connectedness, crossed by many of the most important world air and sea routes. 

The delimitation of the **continental shelf** constitutes a country reference territory inseparable from its increased maritime dimension, giving Portugal sovereign rights to explore and take advantage of the high potential of its resources, as well as responsibilities and challenges in a space that renew its geostrategic centrality. 

It is only possible to explore, protect, and preserve what is known. A sustainable exploration of mineral, energy, and biogenetic resources and, as result, the creation of added value that promotes economic development, requires conditions grounded in three critical factors of success: improving scientific knowledge, increasing technological capability, and defending the continental shelf. 

![58_image_0.png](58_image_0.png)

VI. NATIONAL STRATEGIC ACTION CONCEPT 
Portugal can place itself at the centre of the global network of ports, trade, and energy routes, having the possibility of exploring important raw materials and energy resources. The sea is an important strategic asset. Therefore, exploring the resources of the continental shelf requires a periodical revision of the National Sea Strategy, foreseeing actions that effectively implement a sustained use of the sea. To this end, the integration and articulation of various sectoral policies are decisive, namely in the spheres of diplomacy, economy, â‚¬ducation, science, technology, and environment. As a strategic asset, the sea must be integrated into a national comprehensive approach to security and defence. 

For this purpose, it is necessary to: 
- Maintain an adequate capability of surveillance and control of the maritime space under national responsibility and of inter-territorial maritime space; 
- Clarify competences and rationalise the means and institutions involved in naval surveillance and assistance, maximising existing capabilities and improving the efficient use of means; 
- Prevent and prepare the reaction to environmental disasters and natural catastrophes and implement a surveillance and warning system for natural catastrophes; 
- Optimise the coordination and use of means to fight criminal activities at sea; - Research the impact of climate change in coastal areas and plan the necessary resources to adapt those areas to potential impacts; 
- Promote actions leading to uses, functions, activities and management compatible with sustainable and safe use of existing resources, and increased resilience of the natural and biophysical systems that constitute the maritime space; 
- Implement public policies that encourage the ocean economy, in particular the development of national maritime resources; 
- Promote and encourage the preservation and use of the marine resources in the Exclusive Economic Zone and the continental shelf, through a multidisciplinary approach; 

VI. NATIONAL STRATEGIC ACTION CONCEPT ~ ~ 

![59_image_0.png](59_image_0.png)

- Commit to professional and higher education, and research and development in the area of marine sciences; 
- Develop a collective conscience about the importance of the sea as a factor of national power. 

## 3.2. Promote Knowledge, Technology And Innovation

Scientific and technological innovation is one of the main bases for development in open globalised economies. The cross-cutting dimensions of defence and the industrial, technological, and scientific potential of the institutions and units linked to them - such as in sectors like information technologies, aeronautics, and shipbuilding - make of this sector a potentially dynamic focus for the production, consumption, diffusion, and promotion of Portuguese innovation and technology. 

In this regard, the following are important: 
- Promoting research, development, and innovation as a key step towards furthering a high-level technological standard in the defence sector that improves the operational readiness of the armed forces, and the continuous development of a Defence Technological and Industrial Base (DTIB), integrated in competitive terms in the European defence industry; 
- Integrating DTIB into a broader National Innovation Plan, contributing to the scientific and technological upgrading of the Portuguese economy and to implement the European 2020 Strategy; - Considering technical and military cooperation, not only as training and capacity-building initiatives for the friendly armed forces, but also as an opportunity to disseminate and expand Portugal's defence industry; 
- To explore the experience gained by the armed forces' participation in missions abroad, to develop technological solutions of interest to the global defense and civilian and military dual-use, in collaboration with universities, research centres, and industry. 

![60_image_0.png](60_image_0.png)

## 3.3. Developing Human Resources Potential

The successful implementation of this national strategy starts with the involvement of citizens and with the promotion of a security and defence culture. There are several examples of countries that grew due to the high quality of their human resources, despite limited natural resources. Qualifying human resources is indispensable in order to modernise the Portuguese economy and society. Portugal must simultaneously develop its natural and human resources. 

In this regard, the following strategic lines of action are identified: 
- Promoting human capital through continuous improvement of the education system and by attributing high priority to lifelong learning;

## 3.4. Promoting The Portuguese Language And Culture

Portugal's international standing is inseparable from its culture and language. It is necessary to develop cultural and creative industries with a strong ability to export,, information, communication, and dissemination. Portuguese has the third European argest number of speakers in the world and is the fifth most used language on the Internet. 

To enhance these resources, high priority must be given to the international promotion of national culture and Portuguese language as crucial resources in the assertion of national identity and sovereignty, developing in a coordinated way the following strategic lines of action: 
- Stregthening the presence of the Portuguese language as an international language of culture and communication, notably through the promotion of common efforts with other Lusophone countries for the recognition of Portuguese as one of the official languages of the United Nations; - Fostering Portuguese language and culture Chairs in international universities and implementing bilateral and multilateral programmes to ensure the mobility of students and professors within the Lusophone area; 
- Strengthen the connection between scientific and technological culture and artistic and literary culture as instruments of attraction, dissemination and prestige of Portugal.

## Vii. A National State Strategy

The National Security and Defence Strategy is founded on the aggregation of all actions and elements with the final and permanent aim of protecting the Portuguese nation, guaranteeing its future as a free, independent, and sovereign political entity. 

This strategic concept establishes the major guidelines and priorities that the State and society must pursue in a democracy, to defend our national interests, protect our material and immaterial heritage, and ensure a more prosperous, safer and fair future. Connecting ends and actions to means, the national strategic defense concept represents an essential reference for bidding State's priorities, as well as for the necessary and consequent alignment of public and private subordinate strategies (derived strategic concepts) and, finally, to obtain a coordination of efforts to be asked from the society in general and, in particular, to demand it from the state. 

The national strategic defense concept must be assumed as the state's national strategy, designed to fulfill its fundamental tasks, to whose accomplishment concur all state departments and institutions, as well as the society as a whole. This is a challenge that beckons to us all. 

The national strategic defense concept will only become truly national when Portugal and the Portuguese people embrace it as their own.
