**Press Release**

**IRAQ’s NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY**

its interests:

a. Security component that includes sovereignty, territorial integrity, and the use of
security forces.

Subject: Iraqi National Security Strategy

((General Introduction))

Peace be on you…

The Iraqi Constitution of 2005 – Item 110 – second paragraph states that (establishing and
implementing national security policy) is one of the specific duties of the federal government.
Therefore, Prime Minister Maliki directed the National Security Council to develop a National
Security Strategy 2007-2010. The strategy that represents the policy of the Government, in
achieving national interests and identifying and deterring threats as part of the political and
practical program of the Government, was prepared in a joint national Iraqi effort and high
level coordination in meetings that continued for four months in the Ministries and other
concerned entities.

The National Security Strategy is a document that the Ministries and other Institutions of the
Government use in establishing their policies and plans related to national security. The
announcement of this strategy helps in enhancing understanding of the direction and intent of
the Government of Iraq in the region and with other countries; assists in establishing positive
relationships with the international community and especially in the region; and creates
national tie between the people and the Government so as to make the people part of the
political, economic, social and security program. In order to make the national project a joint
effort to build the government and protect its principles and premises, the following should be
taken into consideration:

and specialists in the field of strategy and the recommendations and work plan
were sent to the DMCNS in April 2007.

b. A main team for preparing the strategy was formed and supervised by the Deputy
NSA (National Security Advisor); directed by the DG of the JPC; and included
eight different advisors from different fields as members; according to the
administrative order 401 of 9 May 2007. This main team worked jointly with a
supporting team composed of representatives of members of the MCNS in the
JPC and a group of experts.

c. Nineteen meetings were held for the two teams in the National Security Council
during the period 10 April 2007 to 1 July 2007. A number of authoritative experts

 Message from the Prime Minister of Iraq

 Progress of countries and nations is measured by the presence of a clear strategy that is scientifically based and adopts practical criteria for measuring progress and success. The success of our democratic approach depends on the general framework of the national security strategy; in which all security domains including political, economic, security and informational are the foundation for democracy.

 Throughout its history Iraq was governed and oppressed by despotism and dictatorship, did not have clarity in its objectives and policies, and adopted a self-contradictory defective ideology and practices that resulted in many crises. 

 Therefore, in order to establish a federal democratic Iraq, the national security strategy was created. 
 Noori al Maliki Prime Minister of Iraq July 2007

**The Iraqi National Security Strategy**

###### Message from the National Security Advisor of Iraq

 In appreciation and acknowledgement

 Article (110) of the Constitution states that national security policy is one of the tasks of the Federal Government; therefore the national security strategy represents a constitutional requirement presented by the Government to announce its vision of the national interests, threats, and the means available to defeat these threats.

 The national security strategy represents the general framework to be followed by the Government in achieving the national interests of the Iraqi people in light of the threats Iraq confronts; the concerned ministries will use this strategy in establishing detailed programs for the implementation of the principles of the strategy.

 Distribution of the strategy to the world will make the world more reassured of Iraq’s intent to establish positive and cordial relationships with its neighbors and other countries; and reemphasize Iraq’s position in refusing to make its territory a starting ground, a headquarters, or a passage to terrorists and criminal groups that threaten the security of Iraq and its neighbors — this will pave the way to rebuilding practical relationships with other countries, especially neighboring countries. The distribution of the strategy, also, contributes to informing the citizenry of the Government’s directions and intent to achieve its supreme interests such as security, welfare, stability and peace.

 This strategy is the result of weeks of a collective effort and hard work of an Iraqi team, in which Iraqis demonstrated the spirit of dedication and seriousness.

 I am most thankful to all those officials from all security ministries and institutions who contributed to this strategy, especially my colleague ministers for their invaluable notes. I also present a special acknowledgment to the Joint Planning Center in the National Security Advisory Team and its director Mr. Ali Abdul Aziz and to all those who contributed to completing this major effort.

### 1. Introduction


#### A. The Iraqi national vision

###### The Iraqi national vision fulfills the Iraqi people’s aspirations for establishing a unified, democratic, federal state, in which both security and stability prevail; all citizens have equal rights and responsibilities under a constitutional government; all look forward to building a prosperous economy opened wide to the world; and the country is an active member in regional and international organizations.

#### B. The Iraqi strategic environment

###### First. Iraq is experiencing a historically dangerous period which is a transition between the quick collapse of a dictatorial, abusive, totalitarian regime; and the transformation of the Iraqi people into a civilized community. This period is characterized by a number of challenges and opportunities that form the strategic environment for the next few years.

 Second. The greatest challenge in this period is that the transformation itself provides a fertile environment for religious, sectarian, and ethnic groupings in a diverse community. This environment permits interference and short-range policies, by regional countries, that are built on special interests and exaggerated fears toward the new Iraq.

 Third. The followers of the previous regime represent another big challenge. The previous dictatorial regime relied on a small group of the citizenry that possessed weapons, money, and experience but lacked the simplest of values, ethics, and knowledge. This group will not easily let go of the authority and national resources that they


-----

###### Iraq First

**The Iraqi National Security Strategy**

###### possessed for decades. They are ready to die to retake their past power and authority by any means.

 Fourth. The current Government has to protect the newly born democracy from the dangers of conspiracy and intervention, while differentiating between the remainder of those who were misled and those who entered into the disbanded Baath Party in order to live under the previous abusive conditions.

 Fifth. Another challenge is represented by the growth of terrorist groups that have adopted Takfirist ideology which has deviated from the ideologies of the region and the world. These groups have found an opportunity for expansion due to the lack of security after the collapse of the previous regime. They also exploited the presence of foreign forces and the general attitude against America in Arab and other regional countries, to get more support from the region.

 Sixth. Another challenge stems from the nature of the wars that the previous regime started. Its misguided policies resulted in international sanctions and the complete isolation of Iraq, and left a heavy heritage for the builders of the new Iraq. It left a debt of more than 120 billion dollars; an internally devastated economy that relied solely on oil exports; an infrastructure neglected for more than 20 years; a low level of individual income; an increase in inflation to destructive levels, seriously damaging the middle class and crushing the poor class; an increase in underemployment; a serious increase in the level of administrative and financial corruption; and the emergence of organized crime run by members of the previous regime. 

 Seventh. The previous regime’s policy of minimizing the legitimate roles of government institutions led to their collapse after the collapse of the Head of the Government. All this resulted in significant difficulties and conditions that permitted the growth of corruption and organized crime, especially as the result of the lack of security that followed the collapse of the previous regime. These difficulties came simultaneously with the


-----

###### Iraq First

**The Iraqi National Security Strategy**

###### rise of people’s expectations for immediate improvement in all aspects of life.

 Eighth. With the collapse of the previous regime, and the beginning of building the new Iraq, it is now time to disband the militias that fought the previous regime and reintegrate them into the society. Dealing the issue of militias formed after the collapse of the previous regime due to the lack of security, and the growth of terrorism and mutual fear poses perhaps a more difficult challenge, if the Iraqi Government wishes to confront it.

 Ninth. Counterterrorism represents another challenge for the Government in that it cannot set aside human rights and freedoms, or interfere with freedom of expression and an independent media which are among its primary commitments. Nevertheless, these security circumstances should not affect the transparency of the Government.

 Tenth. These challenges and dangers are offset by opportunities and national resources: Iraq is a rich country that has a huge reserve of oil and mineral treasures, water, and fertile land; and is also rich with human resources qualified in a way that offers the opportunity for building and a rapid rise of an advanced, multi-resource economy.

 Eleventh. The cultural heritage of Iraq, its history of peaceful coexistence by all its societal components, and the rejection of extremism by the people, offer the opportunity to have a unified multi-group society under a federal democratic system.

 Twelfth. Although these factors and others do not decide the future of Iraq, yet they represent the strategic environment of the current period in which the new Iraq will develop. Iraq must accommodate these factors as it becomes a secure, stable, and prosperous country.

### 2. National Interests


#### A. Political interests

###### First. Strengthening national sovereignty
 The Government of Iraq endeavors to achieve self- reliance, to assume full responsibility for security, and to organize relations with friendly countries, including countries in the region and in the wider international community, through equitable treaties and agreements. 

 Second. Federalism
 The federal system is the best solution to sharing authority between the central government and the local authorities of the provinces in order vest more authority in local authorities according to the Iraqi
#### Constitution. Consequently, the federal system
###### is considered an appropriate model for good governance that represents all Iraqi groups, and that enhances and strengthens the government of unity.

#### mutual relationships with all countries, especially
###### neighboring countries. Iraq seeks to enhance harmony and understanding with all countries, in order to create a stable environment, allowing economic, political and security normalization, so as to make Iraq an active member in all international and regional organizations. 

 Fifth. The rule of law
 The Government of Iraq exerts extensive effort to reform the judiciary in Iraq, including completing legislation, reconsidering laws and regulations that are not compatible with the Constitution, reinforcing the capabilities of law-implementing services, and completing and reforming the system of rehabilitation institutions [including corrections] to be congruent with human rights principles and the rule of law. 

#### B. National security

###### First. National unity 
 One pillar of the modern Iraq is to safeguard national unity and the Iraqi social structure, including different religions, sects and nationalities. The most important characteristic of Iraqi unity is that all citizens share one national Iraqi identity regardless of other affiliations.

 Second. Security of the nation and its territory 
 The fundamental responsibility of a state is ensuring the security of the nation and its territory. This responsibility is embedded in Iraq’s Constitution and is the responsibility of the Federal Government.

 Third. Security of individuals and property 
 One of the primary commitments of the Government of Iraq is to protect the lives and property of Iraqis and other individuals who are legal residents in Iraq.

#### C. Economic interests

###### First. Developing a multi-resource economy and
 making the best use of natural treasures
 Petroleum receipts represent 90% of Iraq’s Government revenues. This resulted from ineffective economic policies for decades. This represents a threat to Iraq’s long-range economic security. Therefore, the Government of Iraq is attempting to establish a policy that promotes a multi-resource economy that guarantees the interests of the next generations, and includes: investment in natural resources, development of the agricultural and industrial sectors; and investment in the infrastructure including communications networks, transportation and other services.

 Second. Developing human resources
 Protecting citizens, improving their welfare and labor productivity, and mobilizing the human capital are among the basic elements essential to social stability, economic growth, and public trust in the Government’s capabilities. The Government of Iraq provides high quality basic services, supports poor families and weak groups; and does not discriminate between them in providing these services. 

 Third. Promoting welfare and raising the standard of
 living
 Every Iraqi citizen has the right to life, security, and freedom. It is forbidden to deprive him of these rights or restrict them. The Government will ensure the welfare of all Iraqi people through providing work opportunities, fighting unemployment; providing a healthy environment, security, and stability; and achieving social justice. 

#### D. Social interests

###### Iraq First

**The Iraqi National Security Strategy**

###### First. Education, Public Health, Social services and
 preserving the environment

 (2) Education
 The Government of Iraq endeavors to expand, rehabilitate and improve the educational system – including private education – as an essential factor for the progress of society, and a right guaranteed for all levels of education, in order to create enlightened generations of specialists, educated persons, and skilled workers contributing to the progress of our country and protection of our interests. It creates the appropriate conditions for the return of intellectuals, professors and scientists, so that they may contribute to building the various sectors of the country that need direction, development, and education. In addition, the Government of Iraq should obtain help from clerics, reformers and religious men in enhancing values and ethics adopted by the sacred heavenly religions. 

 (3) Public Health and Social Services
 Among the responsibilities of the Government of Iraq are to provide nutrition, health care, social and health insurance in sickness, old-age, and inability to work; and to provide the basics for a free and dignified lifestyle. 

 (4) Preserving the Environment
 The Government of Iraq guarantees the right to live in healthy environmental conditions; and preserves these conditions. It, also, develops areas destroyed by the former regime, develops the marshes and green areas, and remediates radiologically polluted areas that resulted from the use of various weapons.

###### Second. Reinforcing the role of the civil society
 institutions
 The Government of Iraq takes care to reinforce, to support, and to ensure the independence of the role of the civil society institutions in accord with their legal objectives. 

 Third. Reinforcing the spirit of citizenship
 Affiliation with the country is a gift of Allah Almighty, and no powers on earth whatsoever has the right to control it. Although there are ethnic differences, yet all nations are proud of their affiliation with their countries. The country is for all, and affiliation with it represents the interaction between the members of the nation and the common fate of the country with which they are affiliated.

### 3. Threats


#### A. Terrorism and insurgency

###### These are among the most dangerous threats as they destroy the pillars of the Government and the political process, and weaken the spirit through targeting the community, infrastructure and governmental institutions. They also incite subversion and instability (terrorists and insurgents include Tackfirists and Saddamists). 

#### B. Sabotage and corruption

###### Sabotage and corruption result in slowing and impeding political, economic and security progress, the application of democratic mechanisms, free trade, the implementation of law, rebuilding, and production of goods. They deplete the national treasures and spread a feeling of inequality among citizens.

#### C. Organized crime

###### Organized crime in all its types represents a threat to our national security. It develops and grows in the same environment in which terrorism and insurgency grow. 

#### D. Regional and international threats, and
 interference in internal affairs

###### Iraq faces dangerous regional and international threats, including terrorists and foreigners who enter Iraq and get support from neighboring countries. Due to the fact that Iraq has a political and military partnership with the Multinational Force in Iraq, these threats do not rise to the level of preparation for or intent to invade Iraq. Iraq will not accept the presence of any terrorist or illegal organizations such as Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups that represent a threat to the security of Iraq and its neighbors. Iraq will not harbor,


-----

###### Iraq First

**The Iraqi National Security Strategy**

###### permit, or support the work of such terrorist organizations on its territory. 

#### E. Illegal armed groups and militias

###### The spread of illegal arms in the hands of illegal groups, militias, and organized gangs is considered one of the major threats confronting Iraq; as well as directly threatening the security of the Iraqi citizen. 

#### F. Mentality of dictatorship and isolation of groups

###### The mentality of dictatorship and the isolation of groups concentrates power and authorities prevent practicing democracy and, therefore, represent a dangerous threat to our national interests. Due to the fact that the abusive and dictatorial procedures are still present in our memories and cultural heritage, this threat presages the return of this mentality. Although there are some exceptional cases requiring imposing emergency procedures for the purpose of stability according to the Constitution, yet such cases are vulnerable to misuse and consequently threaten the return of the dictatorship. 

#### G. Sectarian and ethnic violence

###### The feelings of sectarian and ethnic affiliation that grew during decades of dictatorship represent a threat. In addition, terrorists and Takfirist groups attempt to attack religious and political symbols and provoke subversion in order to provoke sectarian violence among the elements of the Iraqi people for the purpose of dividing them and retaking power and authority. 

#### H. Emigrants, immigrants, and displaced people

###### The collective and abusive displacement of people is a practice linked to the policy and behavior of the former regime until its collapse. This suppressive approach represented a danger whose consequences are seen in the current period. This policy started with stripping away the


-----

###### Iraq First

**The Iraqi National Security Strategy**

###### Iraqi identity of some people, confiscating properties and money, and persecuting intellectuals under the pretext that they opposed the regime. After 9 April 2003, terrorism, violence and Takfirism brought a new approach and more dangerous approach represented by forced displacement of people within the districts of a city according to their identity. Families have been split inside and outside Iraq. The phenomenon of forced displacement became more prevalent. It has become a problem whose consequences might remain for many years until Iraq establishes the appropriate security and legal conditions for their return. 

#### I. Unemployment

###### The Government of Iraq realizes that most of those who commit terrorism or organized crime are unemployed. They represent the most important group on which the leaders of terrorism and organized concentrate because it is easy to attract and enlist.

#### J. Ecological interdependence

###### The problem of decreasing water levels in the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers is a dangerous phenomenon that directly threatens environmental and nutritional security. It affects the climate and wetlands, increases desertification, and even decreases the availability of potable water in the middle and southern regions. This problem stems essentially from the fact that there are large dams in Turkey and Syria for storing the water of the two rivers that do not take into consideration the rights of Iraq to water resources and the longer stretch of these rivers on its territory. Therefore, leaving this problem as it is due to the failure of joint committees formed to resolve it leaves Iraq subject to a catastrophe that threatens its current and future national security.

### 4. Strategic Means


#### A. Political domain

###### First. General political domain

 (1) National reconciliation and constitutional review

 (a) National reconciliation

 i. The constitutionally-elected Government of Iraqi established a comprehensive project for national reconciliation in which all its aspects are positive and transparent. The project credibly demonstrates openness and active participation by all parties in the political process, especially those that have reservations or reform preferences about the political process. Although the project includes those who bore arms to validate their existence and diverse perspectives, it excludes those criminals and killers who have been involved in killing Iraqis.

 ii. The National Committee for Reconciliation and Dialogue was formed and took the responsibility for this project (some meetings and conferences have already been held). The Committee has been taking charge of issues that help in unifying Iraqi people and bringing different viewpoints together. 

 iii. Although important steps have been taken in this respect, the size of the challenges Iraq faces and the need for an immediate mending of the crack that occurred in the Iraqi community due to many factors including Al Qaeda activities in provoking sectarian conflict, requires exerting more effort to arrive at practical and appropriate strategy, policies, and mechanisms for achieving the mission.


-----

###### Iraq First

**The Iraqi National Security Strategy**

###### (b) Constitutional review
 Some articles of the Constitution were the subject of dispute and disagreement among political fronts on the one hand, and between the Government and some civil society institutions and parties that did not participate in the political process on the other hand. Some of the objections are substantive and worth reviewing and some are just expressions of disagreement with the government and the political process. In any case, the Council of Representatives, after reaching consensus, formed an inclusive committee to carry out the constitutional review of the articles that are controversial and to make necessary modifications, additions or deletions. This was considered as a gesture of good will towards some of the political fronts to participate in the political process, to support the government, and to complete the national
#### reconciliation process. 

###### (2) The Rule of Law
 The Government of Iraq is exerting efforts to reform the judiciary in Iraq, including completing legislations, reconsidering laws and regulations not compatible with the Constitution, reinforcing the capabilities of law execution services, and completing and reforming the Rehabilitation Institutions in harmony with human rights and the rule of law. 

 (3) Completing the transition of security
 responsibility from the Multinational Force in Iraq to the Iraqi constitutional authorities
 The Multinational Force in Iraq has been assigned responsibility for security in Iraq by United Nations Security Council Resolution 1546 on 8 June 2004.


-----

###### Iraq First

**The Iraqi National Security Strategy**

###### The Iraqi Government and the Multinational Force in Iraq have been working together to transfer security responsibility to Iraqi constitutional authorities in the provinces that have met the appropriate conditions. The Iraqi Government endeavors with the help of its friends and the Multinational Force to accelerate transfer of security responsibility through achieving the required level of readiness for security forces, reinforcing governance capabilities in the provinces, and reducing the level of the various threats. 

 (4) Reducing the requirements for the presence of
 the Multinational Force in Iraq 
 The Government of Iraq, after completion of the transfer of security responsibility to the provinces and regions of Iraq, will coordinate with its friends the withdrawal of the Multinational Force from Iraq based on the reduction of requirements for their presence for the purpose of training and support according to the threats and security requirements.

 (5) Establishing positive international relationships
 Since the collapse of the former regime, Iraqis have realized that they need to establish serious regional and international relationships totally different from the aggressive relationships established by the former regime not only with Iraq’s neighbors but also with the international community that resulted in strict laws and economic and informational sanctions according to international law. Iraq finds it now necessary to bring together the international community (governments and peoples) to stand with Iraq in the process of rebuilding Iraq as a civilized country, rich with its resources, history, and people. Thus far Iraq has succeeded in that it has taken historical steps in this respect, notwithstanding the difficult period of time and conditions. Regional and international conferences have been held on the levels of Islamic countries, the Arab League, Iraq’s

###### Iraq First

**The Iraqi National Security Strategy**

###### neighbors, and on the bilateral relationships level to create a new environment that governs relationships based on cooperation and joint and mutual interests. The International Compact for Iraq document is one of the bases for international relationships with Iraq. 

 (6) Adhering to international agreements related to
 counterterrorism, collective security, and
 nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction 
 Since the establishment of the modern Iraqi Government, Iraq has entered into many international agreements and conventions that ban terrorism and weapons of mass destruction. The former regime violated these agreements and that was one of the reasons for the international intervention. Therefore, the new constitutional Iraqi Government is committed to fighting terrorism in all its forms, and respecting and implementing international commitments of Iraq related to banning the proliferation, production, and use of nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons. In addition to preventing all that relates to their development, manufacture, production, and use of equipment, technology, communications systems and to work with the international community on nonproliferation. 

 (7) Concluding bilateral and multilateral security
 agreements
 The Government of Iraq realizes that terrorism and insurgency are being fed from outside Iraq. The long borders Iraq shares with its neighbors cannot be controlled solely by Iraqi Security Forces, and therefore concluding bilateral and multilateral security agreements with regional countries will benefit all these countries. 

 (8) Reinforcing the participation of Iraq in the United
 Nations and international fora
 Iraq is an active and founding member of the United


-----

###### Iraq First

**The Iraqi National Security Strategy**

###### Nations. Iraq has substantial international commitments and active participation is one of the bases of the United Nations. The program of the Government of Iraq presented to the Council of Representatives focuses on:

 (a) Establishing friendship, mutual respect, and cooperative relationships with neighboring countries and the world to achieve their joint interests;

 (b) Noninterference in internal affairs, and adopting dialog and negotiation to solve any issues;

 (c) Abiding by United Nations commitments so that Iraq will have the right to participate and vote on decisions under consideration; and

 (d) Participation in all the international organizations that respect the Iraqi people as part of the United Nations.

 (9) Reviewing agreements concluded by the former
 regime that harm Iraqi interests
 The former regime concluded a number of agreements with various parties; and established fake companies and offices run by local, regional, and international parties contributing to initiating financial and political commitments with Iraq that circumvented the unity and security of Iraqi borders. These agreements and contracts have been concluded for the interest of the regime and not the Iraqi people; therefore, these commitments, agreements, and contracts must be reviewed and reconsidered on all levels.

 (10) Reconsidering the law and procedures of the
 National De-Baathification Committee
 The National De-Baathification Committee Law generated a number of local and regional political disputes such that reconsidering it became an important element in the National Reconciliation

**The Iraqi National Security Strategy**

###### Project in order to eliminate the injustices and fears perceived by some of those involved in this Project. It is necessary now to revise its procedures of implementation and transform it to a technically professional committee that resorts to law and the Judiciary and has no political purposes. It is also necessary to take the steps required to assure commitment to procedural rules and reconsideration of many of the previous procedures based on the new direction in the form of a new law in harmony with the Constitution. 

 Second. Political-social domain

 (1) Adopting international criteria within the national
 Judiciary The Government of Iraq must reinforce its capability to implement its commitments mentioned in items 14 and 36 of the Constitution concerning international human rights agreements, through establishing a modern and reliable statistical data base for human rights violations, in order to manage and reinforce legal and institutional protections for human rights in harmony with international criteria; especially for the weakest categories such as minorities, internally displaced families, refugees, returning families, and the disabled. The Government of Iraq manages the Judiciary in harmony with and support of international criteria, the international community, and the United Nations. The Government has to promulgate this management process to include Iraqi lawmakers, Judiciary employees, institutions of the Government, and all categories of Iraqi society.

 (2) Including human rights education in the cultural
 and educational sectors according to legislation
 This process starts with including principles of and education on human rights in the educational curricula

###### Iraq First

**The Iraqi National Security Strategy**

###### of all stages. The Ministry of Human Rights will prepare and train cadres for this purpose.

 (3) Establishing a national committee for human rights
 and reinforcing the role of civil society institutions
 The Government of Iraq will implement a comprehensive strategy for transitional justice, encourage establishment of partnerships between institutions of the civil society that support human rights, and establish a transparent mechanism to reemploy and rehabilitate the employees of disbanded entities of the government the former regime.

 (4) Involving civil society institutions in helping to
 design, implement, and oversee reform, rebuilding and amassing Iraqi social capital in the process of growth
 The Iraqi Constitution states that the Government of Iraq will reinforce the role of civil society institutions, support their development and independence, and support their achieving of their legal objectives. This is accomplished through:

 (a) Establishing laws to protect civil society institutions, to legalize their participation in designing Government administrative policy, to protect legal interests of the people, to diminish the effect of social conflicts, and to oversee the work of local governments and the Federal Government; 

 (b) Enlightening those who establish administrative policies and cadres that are to implement the law, and all the people, of the important role of civil society institutions; through clarifying the authorities and responsibilities, and ensuring participation of everyone in economic and social transformation, including economic freedom and distribution of authorities;

**The Iraqi National Security Strategy**

###### (c) Establishing a comprehensive approach for transparency that reinforces the freedom of access to information through enacting laws and policies related to permitting official employees and institutions to reveal this information to the audience; and amassing social capital in the process of promoting growth. 

 (5) Preparing a draft amnesty law in harmony with
 international criteria
 The preparation of the amnesty law must be in harmony with Item 73 of Paragraph 1 of the Constitution. It became one of the priorities of the national and international requirements and a strategic issue related to rebuilding trust with the Government. It is also one of the important elements for the national compact between the Government and Iraqi society. This law will be established in harmony with international and humanitarian criteria approved by all religions, take into account the characteristics of the current period, and also the balance between justice, amnesty, rewards and punishments. 

 (6) Supporting and developing sports and positive
 youth activities
 The Government of Iraq endeavors to implement special programs and policies to develop a sports domain in all regions and provinces of Iraq in a well- studied and appropriate manner according the numbers, ages, and valid needs of youth.

 (7) Adopting special programs for women and
 children
 In order to foster a healthy generation, the Government of Iraq focuses its research and scientific institutions on establishing and implementing special programs for women and children as two of the basic pillars of the building and continuity of the nation.

###### Iraq First

**The Iraqi National Security Strategy**

**b.** **Security domain**

###### First. Completing the development, missions,
 and functions of Iraqi Security Forces
 The size and composition of Iraq’s Security Forces are based on defeating the identified threats within Iraq’s strategic environment. As the first priority in the current period, Iraq’s Joint Forces will focus on defeat of terrorism and insurgency as their primary mission, with other threats accorded a lesser priority to the extent that available resources permit. In this current period, Iraq’s Joint Forces will achieve self- reliance such that only minimal external assistance and support are needed for accomplishing the primary mission. As Iraq’s security is reestablished and the terrorist and insurgency threats abate, Iraq’s Joint Forces will transition to a conventional defensive posture for ensuring the security of the nation and its territory in conjunction with regional and international security arrangements. Likewise, Iraq’s Police and Border Enforcement Forces will transition to conventional maintenance of domestic law and order and maintaining the integrity of Iraq’s borders. Iraq’s police forces will focus on local police self-reliance except in emergency situations that require reinforcement by National Police or the Iraqi Joint Forces. The capabilities of Iraq’s Joint Forces will be such that they do not by their size or capabilities appear as threatening to Iraq’s neighbors.

 Second. Enhancing the constitutional
 civilian command of the security institutions
 Articles (9) and (48) of the first part of the Constitution state that the Security Services and the National Intelligence Service are to be under the command of the civil authority – and should


-----

###### Iraq First

**The Iraqi National Security Strategy**

###### not be a tool for abusing the people and interfering in political affairs or the Government’s transfer of authority. The Government is striving to achieve this principle through presenting its draft National Intelligence Law, in addition to continually monitoring the security ministries and directorates through the Security Ministries Reform Committee. The efforts exerted by the security training institutions and academies should be continued to rehabilitate the military and civilian cadres and they should focus on human rights topics, democracy, and constitutional civilian control of the security institutions. 

 Third. Completing the transition of operational
 control of the Iraqi army divisions from the Multinational Force, Iraq to the Iraqi
 Government
 The Multinational Force has been assisting the Government of Iraq to create new security forces, police and military forces, so that it may become self-reliant in meeting its security needs. The Multinational Force established the Multinational Security Transition Command, Iraq in 2004 to assist Iraq in organizing, equipping, and training its security forces and transferring their operational control initially to the Multinational Force, Iraq. The Multinational Force and the Iraqi Government established a transition process whereby the Multinational Force would transfer operational control of divisions to the Iraqi Government when the divisions reached a level of readiness as demonstrated in actual operations that was mutually agreed by the Multinational Force and the Iraqi Government. This transition process will continue until all Iraqi Army divisions are under the operational control of the Iraqi Government. When all divisions are solely under Iraqi control, the Iraqi Government

###### will have reached a major milestone in achieving security self-reliance. 

 Fourth. Completing the development of the command
 and control system
 The Government of Iraq has started building a complete and advanced command and control system to control all government national security facilities through an advanced structure starting with the head of the executive authority (Prime Minister – Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces) to all other subordinate national security units of the Government. The next phase requires: 

 (1) Completing a secure and reliable communications network Iraq-wide; and 

 (2) Completing a command and control system that includes security forces in the regions and the provinces. 

 Fifth. Achieving security self reliance
 Iraqi Security Forces, including all services, are growing in numbers, becoming stronger and more experienced. Current conditions confirm the need for more forces to enforce the law, protect Iraqi citizens, and protect Iraqi territory, which requires: 

 (1) Providing and rehabilitating training institutions and academies and adopting a recruiting policy that ensures accurate demographic representation of Iraq. 

 (2) Completing the logistics system of the Armed Forces. 

 (3) Completing the supply stocks, fire support capabilities and the Air Force.

 (2) Establishing and implementing a policy to mobilize all national capabilities towards counterterrorism; and 

 (3) Actively participating in international efforts to counter terrorism through reinforcing Border Enforcement Forces, border entry and exit points, and security coordination with neighboring countries. 

 Seventh. Developing a policy to solve the problem of
 militias and to reintegrate them into the society
 Militias originated in Iraq under different circumstances; some of them fought the dictatorial Baathist regime, and some originated after the collapse of Saddam’s regime for various reasons. The Government is endeavoring to establish a program to disband these militias and reintegrate them into the society in an effort to solve the security problem. This is accomplished through: 

 (1) Reaching a political agreement and a suitable balanced legislative framework to disband the militias in order to control weapons possession. In addition, a series of other procedures is being pursued that lead to building the trust of militia members with Government authority, such as a legislative decision for general amnesty

 (4) Enhancing economic reforms to establish appropriate conditions leading to forming programs related to reintegration of the militias and other illegal armed groups. 

 Eighth. Reforming, completing, and supporting the
 Judiciary Establishing a legal framework compatible with the Constitution and with national and international commitments on human rights requires conducting a general assessment of judicial institutions and their procedures to enforce the rule of law, to reinforce the administration of the judicial system according to international standards and support from the international community and the United Nations, in a way that removes fear from Iraqi people’s souls. The Government of Iraq is also updating criminal and civil law to accommodate a civilized democratic society that requires qualified, independent legislators in addition to increasing the number of courts, judges and institutions that prepare law enforcement officials and conduct rehabilitation activities.

 Fourth. Investing national resources in an optimal,
 transparent, and fair manner
 According to Article (111) of the Iraqi Constitution, oil and gas are the property of all the Iraqi people in all the provinces and regions, since oil wealth is the main financial source for the budget and other energy and petroleum products that are necessary for daily continuous consumption for the people. The management of this sector in an objective, fair and transparent way is one of the priorities of our national security strategy. The development and organization of the oil sector, in harmony with the objectives of improving the society and the national economy according to long-range plans, decreases reliance on oil and gas revenues. In this context, the Government undertook the drafting of a hydrocarbon law, in addition to encouraging foreign investment in this sector. The provisions of this draft law call for establishment of a national oil company, regional committees which are the competent technical authorities in the regions, a Federal Oil and Gas Council to establish federal oil policies, exploration plans; develop oil fields and major oil pipelines; negotiate licenses and development contracts; and recommend policies and drafts of oil legislation. The Government will also maintain an oil and gas independent advisory office for the same purpose. The Government would also open a single account for oil and gas revenues which would be strictly overseen and audited annually by certified auditing companies with results published regularly. An independent council for

###### auditing and monitoring would be established. A mechanism for managing oil revenues will be established to ensure equitable and transparent distribution based on the federal financial system, taking into consideration the effects of price volatility. 

 Fifth. Attracting foreign investment
 This is among the top priorities for the reconstruction of a new Iraq, especially with regard to basic services and projects that fall outside the financial, administrative and technical implementation capabilities of today’s Government. Additional funding support from foreign investments, providing all facilities and guarantees, is an important qualitative leap for the new Iraqi economy. Because Iraq is going through a state of instability, with the spread of chaos and financial corruption in governmental institutions, many foreign investors are prevented from investing their money and introducing their companies in the current circumstances. Therefore, the Iraqi government attempts to encourage investment by giving current investors priority in future investment, and facilitating their work in the insecure areas: 

 Sixth. Adopting a unified budgeting system and a
 single chart of accounts
 For the purpose of managing its funds in harmony with the best international practices, the Government of Iraq will provide for: 

 (1) Unifying the budget within a single chart of accounts; making all implementation procedures harmonious and fair in all Iraq; introducing international funding and money transfers within the single chart of accounts; application of a budget categorization system based on the

###### governmental financial data of the International Monetary Fund and UN’s Governmental Positions Categorization System; and ensuring a high level of transparency through periodic reports, disclosing information, and regularly publishing the results of Governmental account audits; 

 (2) Removing any administrative obstacles to improve capabilities related to tenders, capital and investment project contracts of the major projects for phases to be implemented in the short and middle ranges; and adopting a comprehensive contracting law and system for the provincial and regional levels including management of contracts and other expenditure items. 

 (3) Periodic review of public spending to assess the quality of budget management, to overcome difficulties, to avoid errors, and to help local governments in reinforcing their capabilities in providing services and acting on good governance procedures through establishing a federal financial system between governmental offices based on clarity and transparency of allocations for revenues and expenditures.

 (4) Developing criteria for the review of tax policy, customs and local fees and procedures in order to provide a stable means to increase federal resources and raise the level of growth. 

 (5) Preparing a strategic program to build capacity for financial management, with comprehensive training for a competent

###### staff in financial management at the local and national levels.

 (6) Developing a framework for governmental financial relations with rules applied to the transfer of fixed allocations to the province and district, as well as special requests about balancing investments and current and projected expenditures including estimated conditional grants to cover some expenses. 

 Seventh. Eliminating the national debt, terminating
 interest payments, and obtaining
 international aid
 Iraq is attempting to inform the international community of the legacy of debts that resulted from the former regime’s procedures and behavior that utilized all funds and resources in wars and suppression of the people. It is difficult for succeeding Iraqi generations to take responsibility for something for which they were not at fault or had a role. The Government of Iraq has succeeded in cooperation with and support from creditor countries, the United Nations, and other friends in attaining nullification of 80% of its external debt, and canceling a portion of the interest on the debt. Successful negotiations are continuing in order to schedule the rest of the debt payment and convince creditor countries to cancel additional interest or undertake mutually valuable exchanges that do not affect the general funding for the implementation of economic reform and growth programs which are considered among the most important achievements of the Iraqi Government. Iraq has been able to obtain international support in the form of financial grants to rebuild Iraq (Madrid Conference). Therefore, the most important commitment on the Iraqi Government side to


-----

###### Iraq First

**The Iraqi National Security Strategy**

###### terminate these debts and obtain support is to adhere to the agreements and conventions concluded with the international community; and then making good on the promises made to the Iraqi people. 

 Eighth. Developing a stable agricultural sector
 capable of competing, improving, renewing nutritional security, preserving the natural environment, supporting agricultural
 producers, and developing agricultural
 funding programs
 In order to develop a stable agricultural sector capable of improving nutritional security, improving farmers’ incomes especially in the countryside, finding work opportunities, and preserving the natural environment, it is necessary to: 

 (1) Design a coherent agricultural policy to: provide nutrition; contribute to the trade and industrial sectors and economic growth by assuring appropriate conditions for the agricultural sector that relies on the market economy and principles of the competitive and supported private sector; provide agricultural extension services; encourage investment; increase all loans especially small loans; manage the distribution of water on agricultural lands; provide chemicals, implements and agricultural tools, fuel, and other items (federally); and to gradually transition from the full support phase to the price support phase. 

 (2) Develop the capabilities of small agricultural producers and small agricultural product treatment factories; expand the small farmers’ fund; improve the quality of the agricultural market; and assure the adequacy of product transportation means,

###### delivery to markets, storage, and refrigeration. 

 Ninth. Providing basic services and improving the
 standard of living
 The Government of Iraq employs its financial resources and directs its economic activities to:

 (1) Implement an economic policy aimed at finding work opportunities to reduce the percentage of unemployment, strengthen the middle class, and reduce the poor class; 

 (2) Provide: equal basic educational opportunities to all citizens; public health; an increased funding for health and the environment; 

 (3) Provide electricity, potable water, and improved sewage systems; 

 (4) Establish a comprehensive policy to handle the problem of immigration and emigration in the long run; provide for the needs of the internally displaced; and monitor the status of emigrants and externally displaced people (in the short run); 

 (5) Elevate the level of coordination between national and local administrative units in the field of services (planning and administration); establish regional growth strategies; provide services for those groups that were repressed; and respond to the needs of youth. 

 (6) Sponsor the handicapped and those who have special needs. (orphanages and rest homes).

**The Iraqi National Security Strategy**

###### (7) Provide appropriate housing and mass transport that are among the most important components of an acceptable standard of living. This strategy demonstrates that it is not possible to achieve security unless all the people of Iraq become part of a prosperous Iraq, since the deprived classes provide fertile environment for the leaders of terrorism and insurgency to enlist fighters whose presence is a threat to Iraq and its citizens. Therefore, providing housing and mass transport become important elements of achieving security self reliance. 

 Tenth. Developing social protection networks and
 protecting the weakest and poorest groups
 In order to protect the most vulnerable population groups and compensate them for the effects of economic, political, and security changes, the Government of Iraq’s reforms will be governed by the principles of efficiency and financial stability, equity and transparency. The Government should: 

 (3) Develop a special information management and statistics program in the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs to identify poor households eligible for the social protection network, ensuring rigorous analysis and adherence to the principles of integrity and accountability; 

 (4) Strengthen public and private partnerships to organize vocational training programs that encourage the participation of the poorest in the labor market; allocate a portion of the network budget to the establishment of small projects by these groups;

###### (5) Introduce effective and reliable systems to deliver benefits based on the principles of coordination, accuracy and integrity; 

 (6)  Build Government capacity to prepare, plan and coordinate with civil society organizations for humanitarian emergencies to ensure the delivery of aid;

 (7) Develop a mechanism for the adjustment of social welfare network subsidies in order to preserve the purchasing power of beneficiaries; to counter inflation and increasing consumer prices for goods; in order to prepare for economic recovery in advance of lifting government subsidies;

 (8) Establish a special policy to deal with the increasing numbers of widows and divorcees resulting from past policies and current circumstances. 

 Eleventh. Compensating victims of terrorism and
 political violence
 The Government of Iraq needs to modify and enforce the law for compensation of victims of terrorism and political violence. The current law, number (10) of 2005, needs to be modified to deal with the increasing numbers of victims, whether resulting from the previous regime or from current circumstances. At present, severe social consequences result from the large and increasing numbers of widows, orphans, and handicapped persons. Terrorism leave behind victims of vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices, improvised explosive devices, suicide attacks, forced displacements of people, robbery and looting of governmental properties, kidnappings, rapes, and sectarian killings.

###### Twelfth. Creating work opportunities for the
 unemployed and eliminating poverty and physical and sexual abuse
 The numbers of unemployed increased after 9 April 2003 for many reasons, including delays in adopting strategic economic projects, delays in the engine of reconstruction, the closing of all including small factories due to terrorism and other factors such as the fuel and electricity crisis. All these factors dangerously maximized the percent of unemployed and imposed a real burden that demands solutions. The Government of Iraq has established a policy to rehabilitate factories and the employees of the disbanded military manufacturing committee to give life to the rebuilding of Iraq, and to the management of its economic projects with appropriate budget allocated for this purpose. The Government of Iraq is tightening monitoring and oversight in order to stop physical and sexual abuse; and to deal with the problem of beggary that is run by organized gangs by exploitation of minors to earn money. The Government of Iraq has to find solutions to deal with these inhumane, illegal, and ethically unacceptable phenomena; to punish those committing these crimes; to enact laws to fight trafficking in persons; and to carry out a comprehensive national media campaign that shows the humanitarian and ethical dangers and the illegal means used by companies and individuals that traffic in girls and children. 

#### D. Informational domain

###### First. Establishing accurate and timely information
 systems to support all national interests
 For decades, the former regime kept Iraq and its citizens isolated from most of the world. In no area was this more rigidly enforced than in


-----

###### Iraq First

**The Iraqi National Security Strategy**

###### information technology and the internet. To reverse this corrosive legacy, the Government of Iraq has decided to adopt as rapidly as possible the highest efficiency information technology systems for public and private sector use. By this means, Iraq intends to link itself and its citizens with the entire world community. Democracy and good governance demand accurate, complete, and timely information for citizens, private organizations, and government agencies. This is also an urgent matter in restoring security and prosperity to Iraq. The Federal Government, subordinate governmental levels, and the Iraqi security institutions will establish appropriate information and information management systems to maximize efficiency and effectiveness in accomplishing their missions.

 Second. Conducting information operations to
 influence target audiences to support all national interests
 Information operations are an integral element of government attempts to influence friendly and adversary groups. In modern strategy and warfare, the informational domain is coequal with the diplomatic, economic, and military domains. Therefore, the Government of Iraq and its Security Forces will undertake information operations to affect adversary information and information systems while defending its own information and information systems from adversary attack. In conducting its information operations, the Government of Iraq will make special efforts to prevent the misinformation and propaganda practices of the former regime. 

 Third. Establishing electronic government (e government) programs to support all national interests


-----

###### Iraq First

**The Iraqi National Security Strategy**

###### The Government of Iraq has decided to leap ahead in linking the citizenry to the Government, and the nation of Iraq to the world community. An important facilitator for these efforts is information technology. To the maximum extent possible, Iraq will emphasize wireless technology in order to minimize the need for time-consuming and costly reestablishment of physical land-line networks. The core Government program to lead this effort is the Electronic Government initiative. E-Government aims to link the citizenry to Government of Iraq agencies responsible for delivering basic services and conducting official business with citizens. The aim of E-Government is to satisfy citizen needs with a minimum of bureaucracy, with maximum use of the internet.

 Fourth. Promulgating legislation that guarantees
 freedom of the press and expression in a manner that does not violate public order and ethics
 Article (38) of the Constitution established a mutual obligation and a duty between the State and practitioners of freedom the press and expression, so as to guarantee the practice of freedom but also to commit to public order and morals. In order to establish those rights and obligations there should be a law regulating that relationship without prejudice to the substance of public freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution. In preparing such a law, the Government of Iraq will avail itself of support from the Multinational Force, and the experience of modern civilized countries that have made significant strides in relating to the visual, aural, and print media including the press and publishing houses.

###### Fifth. Establishing a national media policy to
 reinforce national reconciliation and to
 confront the media inciting of violence and terrorism
 The birth of a new Iraq taking the democratic approach and the principle of public freedoms and openness is a strategic goal that requires engaging any information source, highlighting the positive facts and changes that taken place in Iraq. The welfare of Iraq would benefit the people of the entire region. Sometimes we should respond directly to the media source in a conciliatory manner, and at other times resort to legal prosecution. The Government of Iraq’s media policy will be developed as a milestone in this respect. It will provide for the selection of experienced persons in all levels. The Government of Iraq will establish mechanisms to organize and coordinate the work of the agencies responsible for dealing with the Iraqi media, and sponsor Iraq’s quest to adhere to international media treaties.
