##### OPENING STATEMENT
 MINISTER OF DEFENCE

 OF UKRAINE

The Ministry of Defense of Ukraine publishes the eleventh annual edition of the
«White Book – 2015. The Armed Forces of Ukraine» for the purposes of implementing
objectives of democratic civilian control over the Armed Forces of Ukraine as an
important component of the European and Euro-Atlantic integration, as well as
recognizing the necessity of full and reliable public awareness on the Armed Forces
activities.

The year of 2015 was not easy for the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The military

came into it in combat against the illegal armed groups. Alongside with the warfare,
the Ukrainian Army was building up its defensive capabilities and carried out the
necessary reforms. Now we can state with confidence that the missions of the President
of Ukraine – the Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine – have
been accomplished: the armed forces have significantly increased the level of combat
readiness over the year.

The National Security Strategy of Ukraine, a new edition of the Military Doctrine

of Ukraine and the Concept for the Development of the Security and Defense Sector
of Ukraine have been approved according to the results of the comprehensive review
of the security and defense sector. For the first time in history, Ukraine has determined
the course towards European integration and intentions to join NATO. The Russian
Federation was determined as the main threat and military adversary.

A new version of the Strategic Defense Bulletin of Ukraine has been elaborated

together with foreign experts, its public discussion has been held. The State Target
Defense Program on the Materiel Development for the period until 2020has been
drafted. The endorsement of these documents is the issue of thestate decisions approval
procedure.

The military-administrative division of the state has been approved. The Armed

Forces command and control system was improved; the Joint Operational Headquarters
was established. The first steps were taken towards organization and training of the
High Mobility Assault Forces. The establishment of the Special Operation Forces as a
separate branch of arms has been logically completed and the Special Operation Forces
Command has been established. The forces are planned to acquire combat capabilities
in 2016.


-----

Forces’ training was improved: the exercises involved instructors from the armed

forces of NATO and the European Union member countries. In total, over 500 exercises
were held in Ukraine and abroad. The most significant exercise was a command post
exercise «Decisive Response-2015» involving military authorities and troops.

15 combat brigades have been established within the Armed Forces of Ukraine,

district and city recruiting stations system has been restored since the beginning of the
anti-terrorist operation in some areas of Donetsk and Luhansk regions. This made it
possible to conduct partial mobilization activities. About 36,000 new, refurbished and
restored samples of materiel have been supplied to the troops.

The Ministry of Defense of Ukraine implements pilot projects in the sphere of

logistics and provision of housing. In 2015 the Ministry of Defense was the first
ministry which switched to procurement that made it possible to accelerate the bidding
procedure and save public funds. Consequently, food standards for servicemen were
brought up to the European level, and the clothing allowance system was brought up
to NATO standards. Over 1,300 apartments were received by servicemen and their
families, as well as service housing was provided for over 1,400 contracted servicemen.

The Armed Forces of Ukraine ensured the fulfillment of the obligations of Ukraine

under international treaties. In its turn, the international dialogue of the Ministry of
Defense of Ukraine was aimed at the achievement by the Armed Forces of the criteria
for NATO membership, increasing the capacity of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and
enhancing security and stability in the world. We have received an effective assistance
from the leading NATO and the EU armies in countering the military aggression of the
Russian Federation as well as consultative and advisory assistance while reforming the
Ministry of Defense and significant humanitarian and logistics support amounted to
USD 104 million in 2015. Ukraine has resumed its participation in the Partnership for
Peace Planning and ReviewProcess (PARP), which was discontinued in 2014 due to
the need to concentrate forces and assets for the combat against illegal armed groups.

The implementation of social guarantees to servicemen and their families was

ensured with common efforts of all branches of power, including those conscripted
under mobilization. Extra incentive compensation was set for participation in antiterrorist operations, for the successful performance of combat missions within units,
and for the destruction of adversary’s military equipment. The servicemen allowance
has been significantly increased since the beginning of 2016.

The medical support has been significantly improved.The main activities were

aimed at improving soldiers’ personal safety. The medical, psychological and social
rehabilitation course for the anti-terrorist operation participants has been introduced.

The military service in Ukraine becomes prestigious, which positively affects the

confidence of the Ukrainians in the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The Army is supported by
the political parties, public organizations and the media. The state authority’s credibility
has increased among servicemen as well.

There is still a lot of responsible work to do. We clearly know what should be done

and do our best. We will certainly do it. We will win.

Overall, 15 combat brigades, a regiment, 5 battalions (divisions) and a brigade, 6

regiments and 11 battalions of operational (combat), logistics and technical support
have been established in the Armed Forces since the beginning of the antiterrorist
operation. The aircraft fleet and combat strength of the anti-aircraft missile troops has

been established.

The operation of 138 district and city recruiting stations was restored, that allowed

to hold six stages of partial mobilization and to draft over 200,000conscriptees.

The Armed Forces training in 2015 was organized according to the functionality

and peculiarities of tasks performed by formations, military units and units (for details
see Chapter 4).

Combat training of formations, military units and units was mainly practical and

conducted in two main directions (Table 1.2).


**Table 1.2. Main directions of the Armed Forces combat training organization in 2015.**

**Military units and formations performing tasks in the area** **Military units and formations performing tasks in permanent dispositions,**

**of anti-terrorist operation:** **acquiring combat capabilities and restoring combat effectiveness:**

 - providing training of military units headquarters regarding organization - acquisition (maintenance) of capabilities by the military units headquarters

of interaction between service arms units and units of other military to command subordinate units when conducting daily activities and
formations and law enforcement agencies; performing combat missions;

small) altitude, in terms of counteringadversary’s air defense means,
electronic jamming, troops (forces) air support of aircraft redeployment at
operational airfields and weapons and equipment airdrop

Providing troops (forces) with armament and materiel remains an important priority

of the Ministry of Defenseactivity. The financial resources, allocated for the activities
related to the development of armament and materiel in 2015 increased by 2.5 times
in comparison with 2014 and by over 6.5 times in comparison with 2013. This made it
possible to pass into service new items of materiel, procure, refurbish and restore about
27,000 items of armament and materiel (for details see Chapter 3).

The Armed Forces command and control and comprehensive support system

was improved in 2015, namely: pilot projects were launched on public enterprises
management, clothing, food and medical support of military personnel, automation of
management processes and accounting processes and movement of material resources,
as well as provision of housing for servicemen and their families. Implementation
of pilot projects indicates the increaseof the efficiency of using financial resources
more than twice. The Ministry of Defense was the first ministry which switched to
e-procurement that made it possible to accelerate the bidding procedure. As a result
nearly 1,000 tenders were held and considerable expenses were saved.

The implementation of social guarantees to servicemen and their families was

ensured, including reservists called up under mobilization. Extra incentive compensation
was set, in particular over UAH 3.9 billion are paid for participation in anti-terrorist
operations, UAH 94.2 million – for direct participation in combat activities, UAH 4
million –for the successful performance of combat missions, and UAH 0.8 million –for

RESULTS OF THE
ARMED FORCES USE
TO TERMINATE THE
ACTIVITY OF ILLEGAL
ARMED GROUPS


The illegal armed groups supported by the Russian Federation force groupings in
Ukraine continued their activities aimed to destabilize the internal social and political
situation, intimidate people, suppress their will to resist, disrupt functioning of the
state authorities, local authorities, critical industries and infrastructure.

The Armed Forces together with other military formations and law enforcement

agencies participated in the anti-terrorist operation in the East of Ukraine[7] according
to the legislation.

Results of the Armed Forces use to terminate the activity
of illegal armed groups

The use of military units and detachments of the Armed Forces in the area of
anti-terrorist operation in 2015 was based on the Minsk agreements concluded on
September 19, 2014.

The Armed Forces and other military formations and law enforcement agencies of

Ukraine conducted planned withdrawal of artillery systems withcalibermore than 100
mm to the prescribed distances following its provisions. The Anti-Terrorist Operation
Headquarters did not plan and conduct active offensive actions despite a number of
controversial issues regarding the demarcation line.

At the same time the illegal armed groups aimed to aggravate the confrontation and

separate new areas (at least –to the administrative borders of the Donetsk and Luhansk
regions) (Diagram 1.1).

chapter 1


RESULTS OF THE ARMED FORCES OF UKRAINE REFORM

At the beginning of 2015 the adversary intensified shelling of Ukrainian troops’

positions, trying to find weaknesses on their defense. Such actions required additional
decisions to maintain combat and mobilization readiness of the Armed Forces and other
military formations of Ukraine at a level to ensure adequate response to threats to
national security.

The partial mobilization[8] was announced on January 14, 2015. The following

activities were conducted in this regard:

               - draft-age persons and reservists were conscripted and vehicles were delivered;

              - servicemen conscripted during mobilization in 2014 were transferred to the

reserve (demobilized);

               - conscripted servicemen were provided with seasonal field uniforms set and meals

while changing the positions;

               - the national economy of Ukraine was transferred to functioning under the special

period conditions and the designated industries, enterprises, institutions and
organizations – to the COMPLETE READINESS level.

The illegal armed groups started active hostilities

to occupy the Donetsk airport on January 15, 2015,
and implementation of plan regarding the expansion of
controlled territories, whereby the main direction of the
attack was the city of Debaltseve – in the second half of
January.

The further retention of the Donetsk airport was

impossible due to the complete destruction of premises
in the new terminal in the second half of January 2015.
The anti-terrorist operation forces left the airport, but
continued fire control.

As a result of coordinated activities of units of the

Armed Forces and other military formations enemy’s
concept to envelop friendly forces and defeat them in the
area of the city ofDebaltseve, was disrupted. Theunits

were withdrawn from the attacks of the enemy with minimal loss of personnel and went
on the defensive in prepared defensive positions. More detailed information about the
anti-terrorist operation in January – February2015 is given in Annex 2.

The main forms of the Armed Forces use were joint operations (combat operations)

combined with territorial defense.

The activities of anti-terrorist operation forces significantly influenced the

subsequent development of politico-military and military-strategic situation during
2014-2015 winter campaign. The Armed Forces performed all defined strategic tasks
and were withdrawn from the enemy’s attacks with minimal losses to new areas, and
took up an advantageous operational position.

The enemy’s offensive deep into the territory of Ukraine was brought to a halt.

Losses inflicted by friendly forces, forced the enemy to abandon further offensive
operations.

The overall situation in the area of anti-terrorist operations remained complex

during 2015 and was characterized by provocative shelling of anti-terrorist operation
forces’ positions for the purposes of maintaining the level of tension along the
demarcation line, demonstrating the presence and readiness for action, as well as
maintaining a controlled escalation of the conflict as an element of pressure on Ukraine
(Diagram 1.2).

ensure personal security of soldiers, 468 soldiers were killed, 2,324 soldiers were
injured in 2015.

The total area of 1317 ha was checked for explosive ordnance, more than

95 thousand explosive ordnance were found and destroyed in 2015.

Civil and military cooperation

The civil and military cooperation system (Note 1.6) was implemented within the
Armed Forces in 2015 to prevent any pre-requisites for a humanitarian crisis at
regions of antiterrorist operation, social tension at other territories of Ukraine as well
as to help form positive public opinion of the activity of the Armed Forces during the
special period and emergency relief operations.


**Note 1.6. Definition of the term “Civil and military cooperation”**


Civil and military cooperation is a systematic activity of the Armed

Forces on coordination and cooperation with bodies of executive
power, local government bodies, non-governmental organizations
as well as other organizations and citizens in the areas where military
units of the Armed Forces are deployed, in order to form positive
public opinion and provide conditions to perform the assigned tasks
and functions of the Armed Forces by means of assistance provided
to civil population in solving their living issues using military and
non-military forces and means.


During the year forces and means of civil and

military cooperation were first applied to render free
assistance to civil population according to established
procedure, providing supplies, works and services in
framework of the following measures:

- jointly with the State government bodies, conditions

were provided to hold elections of local government at
regions of antiterrorist operation, which are under the
control of Ukraine;

- nearly 1.5 tons of humanitarian cargoes were

delivered for the civil population of Donetsk and


Luhansk Oblast. Assistance is gathered and distributed at residential schools;

               - in January-February nearly 1.5 thousand citizens of Ukraine were evacuated

from Debaltseve city in cooperation with civil organizations;

               - joint centers of civil and military cooperation of the Armed Forces were

deployed in Mariupol city of Donetsk Oblast and Severodonetsk city of Luhansk
Oblast;

                 - the project on mine security and humanitarian demining at regions of antiterrorist

operation in Donetsk and Luhansk Oblast was initiated in cooperation with the
International Committee for the Red Cross, Danish mine clearing detachment,
which is a subdivision of Danish Refugee Council, as well as HALO Trust
Humanitarian Organization.

The Armed Forces were supported by the civil population, local government

authorities, international governmental and nongovernmental organization as well as
religious and other organizations, which enabled to:

                - implement the system of search and exhumation of dead servicemen of the Armed

Forces, law enforcement authorities and other military formations (particularly
in 2015 – 582 dead bodies);

                - carry out medical evacuation of four critically wounded servicemen, who were

on temporarily occupied territory of Donetsk and Luhansk Oblast;

12 Including mine clearing detachments on dependent areas.

               - initiate targeted medical supplies to prisoners of war of the Armed Forces in

Donetsk as well as to medical institutions of Donetsk Oblast, which are not under
the control of the Armed Forces;

               - initiate information exchange with the representatives of local communities on

contributing the activity of the Armed Forces directed towards the restoration of
peace and order in populated areas of Donetsk Oblast;

                - deliver nearly 200 tons of charitable assistance, mainly food packages, essential

products and belongings of various application to units of the Armed Forces.

Implementation of civil and military cooperation measures has enabled to minimize

the influence of consequences of combat actions on civil population in the area of
antiterrorist operation and to develop capabilities to counter the negative information
influence on population on the part of Russia.

The State Budget of Ukraine for 2015 assigned UAH 46,736.0 million for the
Ministry of Defense (which equated to 2.53% of the GDP), including the General
Fund amounted to UAH 45,010.9 million (96.3 % of the budget), the Special
Fund amounted to UAH 819.6 million (1.8%) and the Reserve Fund amounted to
UAH 905.5 million (1.9%).

Only UAH 49,334.0 million (2.67% of the GDP) was actually allocated which

accounted for 105.6% of the annual budget. The General Fund allocation totaled
UAH 45,010.9 million (100% of the budget), the Special Fund – UAH 3,417.6 million
(417% of the budget) and the Reserve Fund UAH 905.5 million (100 %) (Annex 3).

With due regard to the realization of measures to implement decisions of the Cabinet

of Ministers of Ukraine on conversion of radio frequency resource of Ukraine within
radio-frequency bands of common use, revenues to the special fund of the state budget
amounted to UAH 1, 022.8 million.

Moreover additional charitable donations, humanitarian and international technical


assistance were received from foreign states for the
needs of the national defense, in kind amounting to UAH
1,696.2 million.

In 2015, compared to 2014, received financial

resources increased by UAH 22.3 billion or by 1.8
times. It enabled to fully pay-off salaries to servicemen
including fees for direct participation in antiterrorist
operation.

In 2015 at the same time with the escalation of

inflation by 1.7 times, the increase of financial resource
was largely leveled out (Diagram 1.3.)

Allocated funds were aimed at:

  - maintenance of the Armed Forces – UAH 36 939.8

million (74.9 % of the total amount);

  - training of the Armed Forces – UAH 2 084.9

million (4.2 % of the total amount);

 - development of armament and military

equipment – UAH 10,309.3 million (20.9 % of the
total amount).

Analysis of the allocation of funds (diagram 1.4)

shows that for the first time during last few years there
is a visible tendency of slow but gradual approaching to
global experience following the determined positions.

INTERNAL CONTROL
AND AUDIT


Increase of financial support, provided to the Armed Forces as well as increased
attention of society to processes of the defense establishment, required additional
measures, aimed to provide lawful, effective, economical, efficient and transparent
management of state resources, allocated for the needs of defense.

Priorities, types of activity and functions in the sphere of the internal audit are given

in the Table 1.3.


**Table 1.3. Priorities, types of activity and functions in the sphere of the internal audit**

audit

In 2015 the system of internal control and risk management was implemented

following the example of EU and NATO member countries. In order to improve
financial discipline and prevent violations the following measures were taken:

               - implementation of European approaches to administrative responsibility and

accountability of managers;

                - identification and assessment of risks;

                 - containment of risks within the limits, which allow not to affect the achievement

of determined goals.

In 2015 the operational audit[13] covered the economic activity of the defense

establishment and operations on charging certain forms of payment in areas of
antiterrorist operation. During the year nearly 2.3 thousand drafts of administrative
decisions on flow of funds, use and writing off of amounts, property and procurements,
alienation of property and land, corporate restructuring and other issues of financial and
economic activity were worked out. As a result the effectiveness of administration over
the state financial, material and other resources has largely improved, which resulted
in the economic effect reaching UAH 895.9 million and the range of recommendations
reaching UAH 12.9 billion (Table 1.4).

given to law enforcement authorities (Table 1.5).

Generally all means, resources and tools of the internal audit became the basis for

the effective functioning of the system for prevention and countering corruption.

New approaches to fighting the corruption in the military sphere require following
all requirements of anti-corruption legislation by officials of the Ministry of Defense
and the Armed Forces, implementation of NATO Initiative mechanisms on the
development of integrity, transparency and honesty as well as reduction of corruption
risks among the defense institutions.

In July 2015 anti-corruption program of the Ministry of Defense for 2015-2017 was

approved and Commission on monitoring and coordination over the implementation of
this program was established to facilitate the realization of priority directions of the
program.

Non-staff authorized officers, responsible for the prevention and identification of

corruption and charged with functions of anti-corruption experts, were appointed among
command and control bodies, military units and state enterprises of the Ministry of
Defense to control decision-making of commanders in the sphere of administrative,
financial and economic activity.

Main anti-corruption efforts were focused on state procurements, material, food,

clothing and medical support provided to servicemen, implementation of budget
programs as well as military personnel policy. During 2015 over 1 thousand anticorruption inspections of laws and regulations drafts, developed by structural
subdivisions of the Ministry of Defense and the General Staff of the Armed Forces,
were held (Diagram 1.5).

49 supervisory measures were held upon violations with signs of corruption,

27 of which were internal investigations and 22 inspections. Materials were sent to the
military attorney department for investigations.

25 notifications were sent to specially authorized officers in the sphere of corruption

fighting concerning corruption identification or other violations related to the corruption
as well as on received information on such violations by servicemen and workers,
registered in the Unified Register of Pre-Trial Investigations.

COMMAND AND CONTROL SYSTEM OF THE ARMED FORCES

At the same time the command and control system over the Armed Forces requires

further improvement, mainly being focused on saving the responsiveness of forces
(troops) to command and on the performance of assigned tasks. Principles of the
restructuring of the command and control system over the Armed Forces are given in
Note 2.1.


In order to improve the persistence of command

**Note 2.1. Principles of the restructuring of command and control**

control forces (troops), was improved;

control system

                                        - the system of command and control over forces

and facilities was augmented. The command posts of operational (operationaltactical) force grouping included command centers of armed services and Special
Forces, as well as artillery, air defense and aviation. Practical steps were made to
create Single Automated Command and Control System over the Armed Forces,
mainly:

              - the general engineering of Single Automated Command and Control System

is accomplished, conceptual frameworks, ideology and principal technical
decisions are determined;

               - the project on the development of Automated Command and Control System over

the tactical elements of the Land Forces is continually improved;

COMMAND AND CONTROL SYSTEM OF THE ARMED FORCES


chapter 2



  - application of short range radio devices in communication systems was provided;

  - the stationary informational and telecommunication nodes of control points were

equipped with digital communication gears;

  - information exchange networks were extended;

  - the new transport platform for the integrated hardware connection for providing

strategic and operational command and control communication was designed and
manufactured;

  - the technical capabilities of older hardware and communication stations were

improved;

  - the capacity of the Central Information and Telecommunication Node of General

Staff UAF was increased.

The command and control system of the Armed Forces has provided a stable and

reliable control over troops (forces), and organized timely deployment of combat troops
(forces) in the anti-terrorist operation area.

Strategic Command and Control

_At the strategic level, to meet the standards of defense ministries and army_
headquarters of NATO member states the appropriate restructuring activities were
initiated. Many foreign and domestic defense experts and local public organizations
were involved in the elaboration of perspective structures. In particular, the expert
group of the RAND Corporation conducted an audit of the Ministry of Defense
and the General Staff and has prepared recommendations for reform of the military
command and control bodies.

As part of this activity the appropriate structural changes in the Ministry of Defense

have been launched. In particular, the functional purposes of three structural units were
brought into line with their actual tasks. In addition, the following structural units were
reorganized:

  - Legal Department;

  - Department for Development and Procurement of Weapons and Equipment;

  - Press and Information Office.
The number of structural units at the central office was reduced by combining

functionally related departments: the separate Accounts Payable and Cash Management
Department was included in the Finance Department, the Department of Capital
Construction was disbanded and its functions transferred to both the Main ApartmentOperational Department and the Department of Public Procurement and Supply of
Material Resources.

In addition, some new combined structural units were created:

  - The Department for Alienation and Disposal of Military Property was established


-----

chapter 2


COMMAND AND CONTROL SYSTEM OF THE ARMED FORCES

by combining the dissolved Department for Alienation of Military Property
and the Department for the Disposal of Rocket Fuel Components, Missiles and
Ammunition;

               - The Department of State Property was established after the dissolution of the

Department of Economic Activity.

To provide the Armed Forces with foreign modern samples of weapons and

equipment the Military-Technical Cooperation and Export Control Department was
formed.

To develop the financial support of the Armed Forces and introduce the new norms

and standards for property and food procured by the Ministry of Defense, the Centre
for Development and Material Support of the Armed Forces was formed together with
the territorial divisions deployed in different regions.

In 2015, the structure of the General Staff was optimized. The main focus was made

on the lesson learned from combat experience in order to create a future command
and control structure in accordance with NATO standards. In total, 24 organizational
measures were conducted, including the following:

               - the Main Directorate for Financial and Economic Activities was disbanded and

its functions and tasks were delegated to other structural units, including the
Department of Finance and the Department of State Property of the Ministry of
Defense;

               - the Legal Directorate was reorganized into the Legal Support Department;

              - the Directorate of Special Operations and the Main Command Centre, who

performed the tasks of the General Staff were disbanded and the Special
Operations Command and the Joint Operational Headquarters of the Armed
Forces were established, respectively.

The structure of the apparatus of the Ministry of Defense and the General Staff at

the end of 2015 is given in Annex 4.

Operational-Strategic Command and Control

The Joint Operational Headquarters[4] as a permanent military command and control

body was created. The main objective of the new military command and control body
is operational planning and providing command and control over joint force grouping
of troops (forces), and in the special period – over interdepartmental grouping, which

consists of military units and units of other military formations and law enforcement
agencies subordinated to the military command and control bodies of the Armed Forces.

The four joint force groupings of the Ground Forces were formed, who can be

used at two or three threatening operational directions if needed, and this also allows
having strategic reserves.

The Air Forces improved quality and operational command and control capabilities

to counter enemy threats via air. The coordination of activities between all branches of
aviation, intelligence, air defense forces and electronic warfare units to provide support
for ground and naval groupings has been achieved. The safety of aviation operations
in combat zones was achieved through the use of their own air defense and artillery
systems.

The Naval Forces have established new command and control points. The network

of coastal repeaters along the Black and Azov seas was extended and integrated into
the digital communication and navigation network of the Naval Forces. The necessary
measures have been initiated to ensure early detection and notification of all components
of the national defense and security sector about potential maritime threats. Therefore,
the appropriate measures are being taken to create the National Integrated Maritime
Information System needed for informing about surface and underwater situation in the
Black and Azov Seas as well as in the Dnieper and the Danube river basins.

The practical measures for the creation of Special Operations Forces as a separate

branch of the armed forces have been performed. In 2015, the Special Operations
Forces Command was formed.

Operational Command and Control

The renewed High-Mobile Airborne Forces Command has acquired appropriate
capabilities.

The 8[th] Army Corps Command was disbanded; its formations and military units have

been transferred into other organizational structures of the Armed Forces.

The administration of naval bases “West” and “South” of the Naval Forces was

established and the preparation for the acquisition of its operational command and
control capabilities started.

Tactical Command and Control

During 2015, the appropriate measures were taken to increase autonomy, mobility and
manageability of basic battle units - battalion-level units. However, the command and
control system over the tactical units has not undergone significant changes.

The application of unmanned aerial systems was extended to increase the efficiency

of operational decision-making. This was based on the lessons learned in the area of

the anti-terrorist operation. The small size, low visibility, versatility and simplicity
of unmanned aerial systems effectively facilitate the rapid and qualitative performance
of reconnaissance tasks, video surveillance, topo-geodetic and photogrammetric
surveys.


ORGANIZATIONAL
STRUCTURE OF THE
ARMED FORCES

**Note 2.2. The total number of**
generated units during 2015:



- Mechanized Brigade - 1;

- Infantry Brigades – 3;

- Mountain-Assault Brigade – 1;

The reorganization of the Armed Forces aims to improve efficiency of military
command and control system and its capacity for implementing decision-making
procedures in accordance with NATO standards as well as improving the UAF’s
combat power and expanding the number of military personnel.

In 2015, the structure of the Armed Forces has changed. Special Operations Forces

have become a separate service branch (Annex 4).

During the year, appropriate measures for the formation and development of Special

Operations Forces were carried out according to the plan. The capabilities of the highly
mobile airborne troops increased. The recovery of the Naval Forces continued.

Additionally, there were formed 11 combat brigades and regiment, operational

support brigade (Note 2.2.), and also 13 tactical battalion-level units.

At the end of 2015, the total number of Armed Forces personnel was 250.0 thousand

people, including military personnel – 204.0 thousand people and civilian personnel
of the Armed Forces – 46.0 thousand people (Annex 4). However, the decrees of
the President of Ukraine on mobilization and the relevant laws of Ukraine envisage
increasing the number of soldiers in a special period[5].

Representatives of the Ministry of Defense provided the quality control of weapons,

production technology and recovery of arms and military equipment. In addition, in
2015 they prevented cost overruns by the defense industry contractors totaling UAH
1.7 billion.

LOGISTICS SUPPORT In 2015, the first practical steps towards implementing the reform of logistical support
were made in the Ministry of Defense and the Armed Forces, including:

                - the Council of Reforms of the MoD, which included heads of structural divisions

and volunteers, and the Project Office of Reforms of the MoD were created;

                - ten pilot projects in the area of procurement, management of SOEs, clothing and

food supplies, military nutrition, and housing provision were initiated;

               - in July 2015, the Centre for Development and Support of Logistics of the

Armed Forces of Ukraine responsible for the development of new standards for
logistical support, implementation of NATO standards and exercise of control
over development and production of defense products was established;

                - the ProZorro e-procurement system was introduced for procurement of clothing,

food and medical supplies, fuels and lubricants. This system made it possible to
save UAH 260 million, accelerate procurement procedures in the special period,
and considerably reduce corruption risks.

During the year, the Armed Forces were fully provided with fuel and lubricants.

For this purpose 576 fuel servicing trucks were repaired and restored, 426 trucks were
repaired by the repair teams of the Armed Forces, including 183 trucks in the area of
anti-terrorist operation. Additional 160 trucks were restored at no cost by the enterprises
(organizations) owned by local administrations and volunteers.

In addition, the first fully Ukrainian ATs-12-63221 fuel tanker for the Armed Forces

was developed and manufactured, its preliminary tests were conducted. The fuel tanker
is manufactured on KrAZ chassis with a tank capacity of 12 m[3] and divided into two
sections allowing simultaneous transport of two different fuels.

Nutritional standards for military feeding have been brought in line with the

European standards. To improve the food provision system the following measures
were implemented:


-----

                - nutritional experiment[5] was initiated in two military units (stationed in Odessa

and Lvov) and at the frigate “Hetman Sahaidachnyi”. The aim of the experiment
was to introduce NATO nutritional standards, improve quality and adopt new
nutrition standards instead of old;

                - nutritional standards of personnel were improved[6], in particular the daily portion

of meat was increased by 50 g, hard cheese by 5 g, honey or jam by 20 g, salty
lard by 50 g, plus additional bread roll;


**Note 3.1. A set of instant food**



- 250 grams of hard crackers (first grade wheat flour) or 350 grams

of bread (first grade wheat flour);

- 500 grams of ready-to-eat soups (canned soups; one dish per

pack);

- 360 grams of ready-to-eat main dishes (canned cereals with meat

or vegetables with meat; three meals per pack);

- 60 grams of biscuits (first grade wheat flour);

- 70 grams of sugar;

- 40 grams of natural honey;

- 100 grams of caramel candies;

- 2 grams of instant coffee;

- 2 grams of natural black tea;

- (1 tablet) of a multivitamin complex such as “Geksavit”



- supply of drinking bottled water in field conditions

- from April 1 to November 1, and in the area of antiterrorist operation – 1.5 liters per person every day
during the year;

- a set of instant foods for feeding soldiers in austere

conditions and in the area of anti-terrorist operation
was adopted (Note 3.1);

- there were produced 723.7 thousand of dried food

sets, over 520 thousand of sets were supplied to
troops engaged in the area of the anti-terrorist
operation, the remaining dried food sets were used
for mobilization purposes;

- the corresponding changes were made to increase

the number of field kitchens to provide hot meals for
soldiers at checkpoints and platoon-size (companysize) strongholds.

Appropriate measures were taken in order to bring

the clothing allowance amounts in accordance with
NATO standards. The Ministry of Defense has benefited
fully from the opportunities granted by law to determine
regulations on uniform allowances.[7] During the year,
there were introduced 70 new items of clothing, 27 new
specifications, 15 NATO STANAGs.

In 2015, the Armed Forces received 341.5 thou­

sand summer field uniforms, 321,900 pairs of high
ankle boots, 99,600 of Kevlar helmets, 93,100 sets
of body armour, and 215,400 field jackets insulated,
122,700waterproof uniforms, 100,700 sleeping bags.

However, the financial resources allocated in 2015

made it possible to provide only the minimum required
level of clothing for the Armed Forces personnel, and
100% of military personnel involved in the anti-terrorist
operation.

COMPONENTS


In 2015,the actual budget allocation for the implementation of the State Target
Defense Programme of Disposal of Conventional Ammunition Unsuitable for further
Usage and Storage for 2008-2017 (State Disposal Programme) was UAH 39.6
million(10% of the baseline requirement envisaged).

Disposal of rockets and ammunition

Disposal of rockets and ammunition and rocket fuel components unsuitable for further
use and storage is one of the non-core issues of the Armed Forces directly affecting
the course of the reform.

According to the Implementation Agreement between the Cabinet of Ministers

of Ukraine and the NATO Support Agency (NSPA) on disposal of small arms and
light weapons, conventional munitions and antipersonnel mines PFM-1, ratified
by the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine, 6,000 tons of ammunition were disposed of in
2015, including 3.3 tons (19,944 items) of PFM-1 antipersonnel mines by means of
international assistance under the Trust Fund.

In total, 8,830 tons of ammunition was disposed of in 2015 (Table 3.3).

Disposal of Liquid Rocket Fuel Components

At the beginning 442.1 tons of surplus liquid rocket fuel components left in the
warehouses of the Armed Forces. Due to the fact that Ukrainian enterprises were
lacking licenses for mélange disposal, no trades were held to determine the contractors
(Table 3.4).

On the initiative of the Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Foreign Affairs appealed to

the international community for providing financial and technical assistance to dispose
sub-standard mélange. The aforementioned question was also submitted to the meeting
of the USA-Ukraine Non-Proliferation and Export Control Working Group held on
December 2015. During the meeting, the US party informed that the mentioned mélange
was not a rocket fuel component and belonged to waste, and therefore there was no
possibility to fund disposal of such wastes. It is planned to consider issues of the surplus
rocket fuel components disposal together with the OSCE in the future.

The funds for the needs of the Armed Forces training were allocated only from the

General Fund and were fully received in accordance with the budgeted appropriations.
Such approach to funding contributed to improving the quality and level of training and
allowed organizing a continuous process of forces’ training.

The inter-service principle was the basis for the Armed Forces training. The

issues of joint and simultaneous use of land, air and sea components, all arms and
other military formations and law enforcement agencies were of the first importance
during forces’ training. At the same time, the main efforts were focused on conducting
combat coordination between staffs, military units, recovery of training air forces
units, increasing the level of training of personnel in the certain armed forces’
services.

RESULTS OF FORCES’
TRAINING


Practical training and obtaining the necessary skills remained the predominant

part of all elements of military personnel training. The driving force and the main
motivation of personnel training were the examples of war veterans and the current
combat experience gained during anti-terroristic operation.

The determining factor in the organization of the Armed Forces training was
decentralization of decision making regarding its implementation. Commanders of
troops, commanders of military units determined their own priorities and content
of training programs by analyzing the existing level of preparedness of the units,
estimating the future challenges and experience of combat use.

Military authorities training

The General Staff of the Armed Forces outlined the following key features of military
authorities training:

_− for the Land Forces – ensuring the acquiring of capabilities by Operational_

Commands to perform the assigned tasks, readiness to control territorial defense,
the ability to plan and conduct activities of mobilization, command the process
of troops (forces) manning with personnel and equipment;

_− for the Air Forces – building up capabilities for planning the use and control air_

defense of critical state infrastructure under the threat of terrorist acts;

_− for the Naval Forces – acquiring capabilities for planning the use and_

commanding forces in combat operations in the course of management of the
armed conflict and local war;

_− for the Armaments, Logistics, Main Directorate of Operational Support –_

building up capabilities for comprehensive troops (forces) support.

In 2015, the Armed Forces Services’ Commands, four

Operational and three Air Commands acquired combat
capabilities. The skills of military authorities were improved
in terms of planning the use and direct command of interservice and interagency groups of troops (forces), organizing
interaction between units and military formations of the
Armed Forces Services, units and formations of the Armed
Forces Branches and units of other military formations and
law enforcement agencies.

225 operational training activities were conducted during

the year. The most significant of which for the military
authorities training included:

                  - series of staff exercises with the military command

and control bodies involving military units of the Armed
Forces Services and other military formations, law

enforcement agencies and special forces (March – April 2015);

  - command post exercise with military authorities and the Armed Forces troops

(forces) (April – May 2015);

  - command post exercise with military authorities and military units of the

Logistics, Armaments, Main Directorate of Operational Support (May 2015);

  - command post exercise in the Land Forces Command on the territorial defense

involving defense councils and staffs of the territorial defense zones (May – June
_2015)._

These activities made it possible to examine the quality of military authorities

operation, identify the ways of improving the troops (forces) C2 system and optimizing

algorithms of operational units activity at command points. Based on the results of
these trainings, the chain of command of the Armed Forces was unified and integrated
with the C2 bodies of other military formations and law enforcement agencies.

The most significant element of operational training was a command post exercise

with military authorities and troops “Decisive Response – 2015” held in September –
October 2015 with the involvement of the military authorities, troops (forces) and units
of other military formations and law enforcement agencies. Over the last five years it
was the first strategic level exercise, the main objectives of which included:

  - determining the capacity of the Armed Forces system of military command and

control to operatively manage the subordinate forces and troops (forces) assets
during the preparation and repulse an armed aggression;

  - determining the efficiency of functioning the intelligence and comprehensive

support systems;

  - determining the role and place of other military formations and law enforcement

agencies of Ukraine in the defense system of the state.

The representatives of central and regional C2 bodies of other military formations

and law enforcement agencies took part in the training. To indicate the imaginary enemy
and work out practical actions, military units’ headquarters and designated troops were
involved performing tasks on all training ranges of the Armed Forces. Overall, the
training was attended by over 5,000 servicemen and about 200 units of weapons and
military equipment.

Forces’ combat training

To increase the efficiency of combat training, the specific characteristics of the Armed
Forces services in arms, technical equipment, organizational structure, methods of
fighting were taken into account. In this regard, periods of training differed in their
number and duration (Table 4.3).

**Table 4.3. The organization of the Armed Forces combat training in 2015**

The Armed Forces used the most effective and at the same time the most expensive

forms of active training: for military command bodies – command and staff training
on the ground; for military units – tactical training and comprehensive training on the
ground. In general, the intensity of combat training increased in its key indicators by
2-3 times compared to 2014, which positively affected the overall level of combat
readiness of troops (forces).

Overall, in 2015 _the Armed Forces conducted 15 brigade tactical training,_

88 battalion, 62 divisional and 358 company tactical trainings, 21 squadrons tactical
flight training, 703 platoon field firings. More than 21 thousand parachute jumps
were performed. Aviation units performed 674 practical bombings and 769 firings at
ground targets. Ships and boats carried out 120 artillery firings at sea and air purposes
(Annex 6).

In the Land Forces, most of training activities were carried out in the field conditions.

9 brigade tactical exercises were performed. Compared to 2014, the number of battalion
tactical exercises increased by 4 times, the number of company tactical exercises – by
almost 20%, the number of platoon field firing – by 1.5 times. The number of performing

by the units of air defense troops of the Ground Forces. Compared to 2014, the number
of practical bombings increased by 1.3 times. At the same time the average flight time
per one aircraft crew decreased by 1.2 times.

In _the Naval Forces, combat training was organized in new places and areas of_

deployment (home stations). Compared to 2014, the total number of exits (boats)
trainings at sea decreased, by 1.4 times – in average training time and by almost 15%
– in the average flight time per naval aviation crew.

At the same time, intensity of the crew training through the implementation of

artillery firing at air and sea targets, mine and explosive combat exercises was increased.
The intensity of coastal defense units training was significantly increased. The formed
brigade of Marine Corps for the first time held brigade tactical training. Compared to
2014, the number of battalion tactical exercises increased by 7 times, the number of
company tactical exercises – by 5.5 times, the number of platoons field firings – by
almost 5 times.

In _the Highly Mobile Airborne Troops, combat training activities ensured the_

formation (maintaining) of the individual skills of personnel in landing. Coordinating
the units was performed and their readiness for joint and coordinated action with units
of the Ground Forces, units of Marine Corps of the Naval Forces and other military
formations and law enforcement bodies was ensured.

5 brigade tactical trainings were carried out for the first time. Overall, during 2015

18 battalion tactical trainings, 46 company tactical trainings, 137 platoon field firings
and 421 field firings by tanks and military vehicles were conducted.

In 2015, international (multinational) military training for military units of Armed
Forces of Ukraine acquired purely pragmatic sense. Their main focus was to increase
the Ukrainian combat units’ capabilities and the level of interoperability with the
armed forces of NATO for joint participation in international peacekeeping and

Over 3,000 people, 14 ships (boats), 7 aircraft, 5 helicopters, about 200 military

vehicles have been involved in international military exercise on the part of the Armed
Forces of Ukraine.

A characteristic feature of multinational exercise in 2015 was that the Armed

Forces of Ukraine trained to perform tasks together with units of armed forces of other
countries; and in interagency cooperation – together with the units of the National

Guard of Ukraine and the State Border Guard Service
of Ukraine.

In 2015, as a part of the multinational exercises, the

initiative of continuous cycle of combat training of the
identified Armed Forces of Ukraine was launched in
order to increase combat capabilities of mechanized and
airborne military units. Training Ukrainian units is based
on the International Peacekeeping and Security Centre
(village of Starychi, Lvov region) on a rotational basis by
cycles of up to nine weeks each. The first training cycle
started in November 2015 with the direct participation of
instructors from the armed forces of the US and Canada.
The structure of the first rotation included battalion
tactical groups of 350 Ukrainian people.

Multinational military exercises promoted performing

the task of introducing NATO standards in the functional activity of the Armed Forces
military command and control bodies and the learning the Alliance’s system of decisionmaking. At the same time, the Ukrainian experience on combating hybrid threats and
modern practice of fighting against irregular military formations has interested the
defense agencies of the partner countries.

In 2015, the Armed Forces of Ukraine resumed participation in training events by

NATO standards within the Planning and Review Process and Joint Pool of Operations
Forces and Capabilities of the Operational Capabilities Concept (OCC). During the
year, two units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine passed the procedure of evaluation:

  - frigate “Hetman Sahaidachny” – self-evaluation Level 1 in the Ukrainian
American multinational trainings “Sea Breeze – 2015”;

  - military transport aircraft Il-76MD – the main phase of NATO evaluation Level

2 during Ukrainian-Danish operation “Northern Falcon – 2015”.

During the Ukraine-USExercise “Sea Breeze – 2015” together with NATO

multinational training team national course for training specialists on evaluations Level
1 under OCC was conducted. 23 experts in evaluation were taught, among them –
11 Level 1 specialists and 12 Level 2 specialists.

By the end of the year, four units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine[4] were evaluated

at the appropriate levels within the OCC and considered as ones able to participate in
NATO-led trainings and operations and to be engaged in multinational military units
of high readiness.


**In 2015, the joint efforts of the Ministry of Defense and the General Staff**

**provided quality training of troops (forces) to perform the assigned tasks.**
**Combat coordination of the newly formed military units (subdivisions) was**
**conducted which ensured a successful rotation of troops in a combat zone and**
**reliable performance of tasks during anti-terrorist operation.**

Cooperation with the United States in the defense

sphere changed from the crisis response policy to the
stable long-term strategic partnership. The new format
of cooperation was discussed during the Ministry of
Defense of Ukraine visit to the USA in September 2015.
Based on these results the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine
together with the American side began to develop

Ministry of Defense of Ukraine and the Department of
Defense of the United States of America for the term
of 5 years.”, which is directed towards improvement of
command and control and planning systems, training,
education and forces employment as well as towards
comprehensive support of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
In general, more than 20 meetings were carried out with

the defense agency authorities as well as with the representatives of the Senate and the
Congress of the USA.

For the first time in Ukrainian Army history, according to the President of Ukraine

decision, American RAND Corporation (“Research and Development”) analytical
center was involved to determine the directions of defense institutes reformation and
achievement of criteria necessary to obtain the membership in NATO.

The active cooperation with American part within the framework of Multinational

Joint Coordination Committee on military cooperation and defense reformation has
been carried out. This Committee was transformed from Ukrainian-American into
multinational one.

The result of this cooperation was the deployment of the Joint multinational group

on training –Ukraine (JMTG-U), the task of which was to organize practical activities
on training of the Ukrainian Armed Forces personnel. Besides the USA, such countries
as Canada, Republic of Lithuania and Great Britain joined the mentioned initiative
within the JMTG-U.

Providing humanitarian and logistic support to the armed Forces of Ukraine and

arranging of treatment of servicemen, wounded in the area of the anti-terrorist operation
conduction at public health services of the USA became an essential direction of
cooperation.

**United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is a key partner of**

Ukraine. Besides generally recognized directions of bilateral cooperation, a course
training of subunits of the Armed Forces of Ukraine at the base of educational centers
and training ranges of the Armed Forces of Ukraine along with engagement of Britain
instructors was initiated. 21 tactical course trainings have been conducted during the
work of training groups. 1 thousand people from complete mobilization of the Armed
Forces of Ukraine units have been trained during the trainings.

Moreover, the first Anti-corruption week and the number of educational courses and

seminars on preventing and counteracting corruption for the officials of the Ministry of
Defense of Ukraine, the General Staff of Ukraine was held in 2015 with the assistance
of the Embassy of United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to Ukraine,
the “Transparency International” non-governmental organization and the Center for
integrity in the defense sector (CIDS).

In 2015 the government of the Federal Republic of Germany made a substantial

contribution into meeting requirements of the population and the Armed Forces in
the area of the anti-terrorist operation conduction. Modern military equipment was
transferred and common projects on improving life conditions were initiated. More than
50 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine underwent treatment and rehabilitation

###### ANNEX 2


#### ANALYSIS OF THE

 ANTI-TERRORIST OPERATION

 IN JANUARY – FEBRUARY 2015.

The first phase (December 2014 – the middle of January 2015)

In December 2014 - January 2015 the headquarters of the anti-terrorist operation
(ATO) continued the implementation of the peace plan of the bilateral ceasefire in
the "Silence".

Military units performed tasks on more than 90 checkpoints, 140 reference points

and one battalion area of defense, guarded and defended three airports ( "Donetsk",
"Kramatorsk" "Mariupol"), two equipment storage bases in Artemivsk and position of
the radar company "Kater" near Avdiyivka.

The main effort of the military units focused on stabilizing the situation in the

territories under control, regrouping of forces and means, resupplying ammunition and
other materiel, restoring combat effectiveness in certain areas, improving technical
equipment of checkpoints and strong points.

Despite the announcement of full ceasefire, illegal militias supported by the regular

Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, continued to look for opportunities to disrupt
the peace not stopping the shelling positions of ATO forces and populated areas. In the
period from December 9, 2014 till January 15, 2015 the militias conducted 1052 attacks
on the Ukrainian troops.

The activity of Russian sabotage and reconnaissance groups increased. Penetration

and actions of about 80 sabotage and reconnaissance groups were documented.

Taking the opportunity of ceasefire, the Russian side has greatly increased the

number of unmanned aircraft flights that conducted reconnaissance of our troops’
positions, secretly supplied weapons, including under the guise of "humanitarian
convoys", fully supplied and trained illegal militias, particularly on the territory of
the Russian Federation. Every day more than 40 trucks with ammunition, material and
technical facilities and their personnel, as well as weapons and military equipment
penetrated the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine through uncontrolled
checkpoints.

In the middle of January, 2015 the enemy significantly increased the number of

attacks on ATO forces with the aim of ousting them from their positions. The most
intense shelling was carried out on Debaltsevo and Donetsk areas.

The second phase (the second half of January, 2015)

The second half of January was affected by the fierce fighting near the Donetsk
airport. During 242 days the ATO forces were defending the airport. The Donetsk
airport became a symbol of courage and heroism of our soldiers.

The Donetsk airport could become a transit base for the Russian Federation to

supply the area by the conflict of arms, ammunition and military equipment. That’s
why the control over airports of Donetsk, Lugansk and Kramatorsk was one of the main
objectives of the antiterrorist operation.

In January 15, 2015 the enemy began active combat actions to capture the Donetsk

airport. In turn, in January 18, 2015 the Ukrainian command launched an operation
of deblocking the surrounded airport defenders and preventing the capture of a new
terminal by militias. All scheduled tasks failed.

ANALYSIS OF THE ANTI-TERRORIST OPERATION IN JANUARY – FEBRUARY 2015


Annex 2


The situation near the Donetsk airport needed to make important decisions, one of

which was to destroy the flight landing strip and search for soldiers who were still in
the new terminal. In January 20, 2015 the flight landing strip was put out of action.
At the same time the remote mining of the Putilov bridge was conducted. It greatly
complicated the enemy ammunition and military equipment delivery.

Further holding the new terminal was not possible because of its complete

destruction. The ATO forces left the airport, but continued his fire control.

The third phase (the end of January – February 2015)

After capturing the Donetsk airport, the illegal militias supported by the Armed
Forces of the Russian Federation intensified their efforts on Debaltsevo direction
and initiated attacks on the 25th of January, 2015.

Reaching the goal by the enemy was to become a factor of motivating the Government

of Ukraine, the western mediators and the heads of “Normandy Four” states on the eve
of another round of talks in Minsk to take into account the requirements and interests
of the Russian Federation.

The militias of so-called "Gorlivka-Enakievo group" launched an offensive towards

Gorlivka, Vuglegirsk in order to surround the Ukrainian troops near Debaltseve.

The units of the 128th separate mountain infantry brigade put up a stout defense

of populated areas such as Chornukhyne, Ridkodub, Nikishin and stopped the enemy
from the east. After that the main efforts of military units and units of the anti-terrorist
operation were aimed at drawing fire destruction of the enemy reserves in such areas as
Gorlivka, Yenakiyevo, Khartsyzsk, Rozsypne, Alchevsk, Stakhanov.

During repulsing the enemy attack, increasing our troops number by regrouping

military units from other areas and those who have completed the restoration of combat
capability was conducted. The balance of forces and means at that time, made it possible
to conduct only positional defense to prevent loss of controlled territory, stopping the
enemy, winnig time to regroup forces (cutting 1).

Understanding this, the Russians began an active movement of weapons and

military equipment to Debaltsevo bridgehead. Moving is carried out both in Donetsk
and Lugansk regions, and from the Russian Federation. The enemy was intended by
any circumstances surround our troops before the “Normandy Four” talks in Minsk on
February 12, 2015.

Adequate development of combat power of the Armed Forces of Ukraine was

impossible due to lack of reserves. Moving units from other areas would lead to a
weakening of the flanks. In other areas the enemy was trying to tie down the ATO forces
to prevent their regrouping and moving reserves.


**Cutting 1. The balance of forces and means on**
Debaltsevo bridgehead (АТО forces –
Illegal militias)



- service personnel – 1 : 2,1;

- tanks – 1 : 3,5;

- armored combat vehicles – 1 : 1,3;

- multiple rocket launcher systems – 1 : 7,5;

- artillery systems – 1 : 7,1


The most difficult situation is in the area near Debaltseve, where the

enemy have regrouped and was trying to take the city by storm.

After active harbor and assault actions near Debaltseve,

Chornukhyne, Kamenka, Olkhovatka, Sanzharivka, Nyzhnie Lozove,
with support of MRLS, artillery and tanks, the enemy broke through the
defense of our troops in the direction of Verhulivka, entered the eastern
outskirts of Debaltsevo and took control over the main administrative
buildings of the city, the railway junction, Zhovtnevyi neighborhood.

Enemy units were exhausted. Due to significant losses their

offensive potential has been exhausted. To continue the offensive the


enemy needed at least two days to rest, resupply of missiles and ammunition, as well as
regrouping provisions which were stopped by the fire of our artillery.

Considering the units of ATO forces in Debaltsevo direction had performed all of

the tasks, and the situation as well, it was decided to withdraw units from the district
of Debaltseve till the morning of February 18, 2015 with the aim of preserving the
life and health of personnel, weapons and military equipment. Our troops withdraw
to determined defense was organized and conducted with minimal loss of personnel,
weapons and military equipment.

Annex 2


ANALYSIS OF THE ANTI-TERRORIST OPERATION IN JANUARY – FEBRUARY 2015

After withdrawing, units were concentrated in the collection area (town Artemivsk).

Totally out of the number of 2678 persons who were a subject of withdrawal, 2629
persons, including 131 wounded soldiers, were withdrawn. Also more than 810 pieces
of weapons and military equipment, accounting for more than half of the total in the
area of Debaltseve, were extracted in the period from October 2014 to February 2015.
Among them, over 50% - the military equipment, the rest - special and automotive
equipment.

A system of areas, lines and positions was developed to ensure the troops’

withdrawal. Mobile armored units (reserves) were organized and maintained deeply in
the operational order of forces.
