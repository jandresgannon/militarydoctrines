## FOREWORD

**NORWAY IN THE NORTH**
**– THE WAY FORWARD**

The High North is Norway’s most important
strategic priority area. My Government made
this clear in its inaugural address, and we
followed up by presenting our High North
Strategy on 1 December 2006. The overall
aim is to enhance knowledge in and about the
north, increase our activity and presence in
the area and lay the foundations for sustainable economic and social development in the
years to come.

More than two years have now passed since
the Government presented its High North
Strategy. During this period we have gained
further insight into the opportunities and
challenges created by developments in the
north, particularly in the fields of climate and
energy and in our relations with Russia. The
High North Strategy contained 22 specific
action points. Most of them have now been
carried out. But that does not mean that the
strategy will soon be a closed chapter of a
book we can lay aside. Quite the contrary.
The High North Strategy is a project that is
constantly evolving. Achieving lasting results
will require focused efforts over several
parliamentary periods. We are only just at the
beginning.

The need to develop our High North Strategy
is greater than ever. This is apparent when we
look at how the world around us is changing.
During the past few months both the EU and
the US have presented their own strategies
for the High North. They plan to step up their
engagement in this area, and so do Russia
and many other key actors. International


interest in the Arctic and the world’s northernmost regions will continue to grow. It is
our intention to stay ahead of these developments.

Implementing the High North Strategy has
given us opportunities to listen and learn
from many sources in the north and in the
rest of Norway, as well as in our contact with
other countries. We have gained experience
and have received valuable input. This has
provided a basis for setting the course ahead.

Part I of this publication – New Building
Blocks in the North – presents the Government’s platform for its further efforts in this
field.

Part II of the publication provides the
backdrop to Part I. It contains examples that
illustrate the diversity of the challenges and
opportunities we are facing in our High North
policy, and gives an overview of the issues we
have been focusing on.

The Government intends to continue and
intensify its High North efforts. These efforts
build on constructive partnerships – between
the public and private sector, between central
and local authorities, and between Norwegian
and foreign actors. There are no clear-cut
answers. We want as many as possible to be
involved in determining the way ahead, and
encourage frank and broad-based debate.

Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg
Oslo/Tromsø, 12 March 2009.

## NEW BUILDING BLOCKS IN THE NORTH THE NEXT STEP IN THE GOVERNMENT’S HIGH NORTH STRATEGY


**Introduction**

In its policy platform, the Government stated
that it considers the High North to be Norway’s most important strategic priority area
in the years ahead. In December 2006 the
Government presented its High North Strategy as an element in its efforts to translate
this part of the policy platform into practical
policy. Seven main political priorities were
formulated in the strategy:

1. We will exercise our authority in the High
North in a credible, consistent and predictable way.
2. We will be at the forefront of international
efforts to develop knowledge in and about
the High North.
3. We intend to be the best steward of the
environment and natural resources in the
High North.
4. We will provide a suitable framework for
further development of petroleum activities in the Barents Sea, and will seek to
ensure that these activities boost competence in Norway in general and in North
Norway in particular, and foster local and
regional business development.
5. We intend the High North policy to play a
role in safeguarding the livelihoods,
traditions and cultures of indigenous
peoples in the High North.
6. We will further develop people-to-people
cooperation in the High North.
7. We will strengthen our cooperation with
Russia.

In addition, the Government formulated 22
specific action points. Most of these have now
been carried out or started. This work has


been integrated into the normal procedures in
several ministries.

In this document, the Government is presenting a series of strategic priority areas that
will serve as new building blocks in the
Government’s High North policy. Continuing
to pursue this policy will put us in a better
position to meet the great challenges related
to climate and environmental change, and to
seize the opportunities in the north.

The Government’s further High North efforts
are intended to enhance Norway’s ability to
exercise sovereignty and promote sustainable
management of renewable and non-renewable
resources. Economic activity based on the
region’s own resources will be essential in securing welfare and employment in the region.
Business and industry, research and other
activity in the north will help to secure a Norwegian presence by maintaining settlement
patterns, and will thereby also strengthen
Norway’s exercise of sovereignty in the region. The High North Strategy is furthermore
intended to ensure that the area’s strategic
location is exploited to the benefit of society
as a whole, and that Northern Norway’s
comparative advantages are used to promote
economic growth and value creation in Northern Norway and the rest of the country.

The Government’s High North policy is
additional to its general rural and regional
policy and to various sector policies. All of
this will help to maintain settlement patterns
in the north and promote development that is
conducive to cooperation with other countries
and respects the rights of indigenous peoples.


-----

The Government therefore intends to:

1. Develop knowledge about climate and the
environment in the High North.
2. Improve monitoring, emergency response
and maritime safety systems in northern
waters.
3. Promote sustainable development of
offshore petroleum and renewable marine
resources.
4. Promote onshore business development.
5. Further develop the infrastructure in the
north.
6. Continue to exercise sovereignty firmly
and strengthen cross-border cooperation
in the north.
7. Safeguard the culture and livelihoods of
indigenous peoples.

These specific action points have a time
horizon of 10–15 years. However, they need to
be seen in a dynamic perspective and not as a
final plan of action for the next 10–15 years.

New challenges will require new knowledge.
In turn, new knowledge provides opportunities for economic and social development.
New problems are bound to arise relating to
the environment and climate change. New oil
and gas discoveries could offer new opportunities and create new needs for infrastructure development, transport and business
development, both onshore and offshore. In
the next 10–15 years we will constantly be
faced with new challenges and opportunities.
The action points presented here will set a
new course and serve as the building blocks
of a dynamic policy for the High North.


Priorities between the various action points and
the order and speed of their implementation
will be considered on an ongoing basis, and
will be described in the Government’s annual
budget proposal to the Storting (the Norwegian Parliament). Efforts in this area will have
to be adapted to activity in the Government’s
other priority areas, and to the economic situation in each budget year.

The foreign and domestic policy dimensions
of the High North Strategy are closely linked.
The projects described in this document are
intended to promote a stronger presence and
increased activity and development in the three
northernmost counties and in Svalbard, which
will in turn enhance Norway’s credibility and
influence when High North issues are discussed internationally.

In the Government’s strategy, the High North
is not precisely defined, nor is it limited to
Norwegian territory. Important Norwegian
interests are linked to developments in the
Arctic and the wider circumpolar area, and
internationally the terms “the High North” and
“the Arctic” are frequently used interchangeably. Norway’s strategic efforts in the north
must be seen in a geopolitical context. Norway will continue the active dialogue on High
North issues with its neighbours, partners and
allies, and will seek to make Norway’s High
North policy more visible in international and
regional cooperation forums. Strengthened
international cooperation in the north – both
circumpolar cooperation and cooperation with
Russia in particular – will in turn be beneficial
for development in Northern Norway.


-----

**1.  DEVELOPING KNOWLEDGE ABOUT**
**CLIMATE AND THE ENVIRONMENT IN THE**
**HIGH NORTH**

Increasing international attention is being
focused on the High North in response to
environmental and climate change, polar ice
melting and the challenges posed by these
changes. Norway is uniquely positioned to
monitor the impacts of anthropogenic environmental and climate change, which is particularly marked in the High North. Arctic climate
change is affecting the global climate system
and vice versa. Norway has the advantage
of direct access to cold, ice-free areas. This
means that research communities in our northern areas have a considerable advantage as
regards research on climate change in general,
and more specifically on the role the Arctic
plays in the global climate system. Knowledge
is at the core of the Government’s High North
Strategy. The Government intends to promote
knowledge development to enable us to fully
seize the opportunities and address the challenges we are facing in the north.

Research infrastructure is a basic requirement
for research and knowledge development
in the High North. Strategic investments in
observation and communication equipment
facilitate research of global significance and
make Norway attractive as a base for international research activities. Improved research
infrastructure can also generate ripple effects
in the form of innovation and technological
and business development. In turn, technological and business development will strengthen
the existing knowledge base and encourage
research on climate and the environment in
the region.


**1.1  Developing a centre for climate and**
**environmental research in Tromsø**
The Government is focusing on developing
knowledge about climate and the environment that will enable Norway to further
improve the management of its sea and land
areas in the north and the resources found
there. Sound resource management and
efforts to protect the environment and address climate change are key elements of the
Government’s High North Strategy. Environmental and climate change, increasing
pressure on natural resources and large-scale
new activities could have far-reaching impacts
on society and the environment, not least
because a large part of the value creation in
the north depends on the natural environment and living resources. However, there is
great uncertainty about what the impacts are
likely to be. More knowledge about climate
and the environment is therefore of great strategic value in connection with management,
adaptation to climate change and planning in
the north.

The Government will facilitate the establishment of a leading international centre for environmental and climate research in the High
North by further developing existing knowledge institutions in Tromsø (the Norwegian
Polar Institute, the University of Tromsø, the
Institute of Marine Research, Akvaplan-niva,
the Norwegian Institute for Nature Research,
the Norwegian Institute for Air Research,
Nofima and the Norwegian Radiation Protection Authority). Making Tromsø a focal point
of knowledge and expertise on climate and
the environment will strengthen Norway’s
role and influence in international cooperation
in the north, and will therefore help to ensure


-----

that Norway’s interests are safeguarded
in the best possible way. It is particularly
important to build expertise on the growing
international problem of climate change and
ocean acidification. This is a field where Norway, with its large sea areas, has an interest in
staying at the forefront of research. Research
in this field must be seen in connection with
other processes, including the implementation of the plan that has been adopted for
building up climate-related research and the
Klima 21 forum for climate research. Arctic
climate processes play an important role in
the global climate system as well. A better
understanding of these processes is crucial
for predicting future climate change. Knowledge building in this field will therefore be
an important contribution to international
climate-related efforts. Tromsø is the centre
of a region that offers an abundance of natural
assets and living resources, a number of
important knowledge institutions that can be
further developed, and geographical proximity to key areas as regards climate, resource
exploitation and changing patterns of activity.

The centre will be organised as a network
with a joint secretariat, established in conjunction with the Polar Environmental Centre’s
secretariat. The secretariat will be responsible for coordinating cooperation between the
participating institutions both nationally and
internationally. Developing the knowledge
institutions in Tromsø into a leading international centre for environmental and climate
research in the High North will require
closer coordination between the participating organisations and other R&D centres in
Northern Norway.


An ice-class research vessel based in Tromsø
will be an important part of the infrastructure
for the environmental and climate research
centre (see separate discussion in section
1.2.3).

The Government’s goal is for the following
elements to be included in the development of
the environment and climate research centre
in Northern Norway:

�� _The establishment of the Centre for Ice,_
_Climate & Ecosystems (ICE):_
Establish the centre in 2009. The main
purpose will be to strengthen research on
and monitoring of climate and ice conditions at the Norwegian Polar Institute in
cooperation with key institutions in
Norway, particularly the University of
Tromsø, the University Centre in
Svalbard and the Bjerknes Centre for
Climate Research. The goal is for the
centre to become a world leader in its
field.

�� _Generating knowledge of the environ-_
_ment and living resources in the marine_
_environment in the north:_
Sea: Strengthen research and resource
management expertise and survey and
monitoring programmes related to the
implementation of the integrated management plan for the Barents Sea–Lofoten
area. Field stations that monitor coastal
and fjord ecosystems in Finnmark county
will be drawn into these efforts. Further
development of the Norwegian Polar
Institute and the Institute of Marine
Research will be key elements in this
connection.


-----

Svalbard and the Arctic: Strengthen
management-oriented expertise adapted
to needs in Svalbard, for example
necessary expertise on the impacts of
climate change and possible changes in
business activity and traffic, including
opportunities for the development of new
business activities. Further development
of the Norwegian Polar Institute and the
Institute of Marine Research will be key
elements in this connection.
Terrestrial environment: Strengthen
expertise on the impacts of climate
change on the natural environment and
the traditional livelihoods of indigenous
peoples and on adaptation strategies.
This competence building should mainly
take place at the Norwegian Polar Institute, the University of Tromsø, the Sami
University College and other relevant
institutions in Northern Norway.

�� _New research programme on climate_
_change and ocean acidification:_
Major changes in the marine ecosystems
in the north are expected as a result of
ocean acidification. Norway is responsible
for large and economically important sea
areas in the north and should therefore
remain at the forefront of developments
on understanding and predicting the
effects of the chemical changes that take
place as CO2 levels in the oceans rise
and they become more acidic. As part of
the plan for building up climate-related
research, a new research programme
on ocean acidification has been proposed
under the Research Council of Norway.


�� _Knowledge building on the impacts of and_
_adaptation to climate change for_
_business and industry, based on cross-_
_sectoral cooperation:_
Climate change and ocean acidification
will lead to changes in living conditions
for marine species. Some species may
change their migration patterns and
feeding and spawning grounds, while
others may spread to new areas. There
may be corresponding changes in the
conditions for aquaculture. Building up
an understanding of the links between
climate change, ocean acidification,
marine ecosystems and the conditions
for commercial/business activities based
on natural resources is essential, particularly in the High North, where the fisheries are a vital basis for settlement patterns.

�� _Knowledge building on the impacts_
_of the growing volume of maritime_
_transport in the Arctic:_
The ice conditions in the Arctic are changing rapidly, and this is opening up new
areas to shipping. Research on the effects
of local pollution and of the physical
breaking-up of the ice is therefore important.

�� _Further development of expertise on_
_coastal and fjord ecology:_
The intention is to develop knowledge
about the changes that are occurring in
coastal and fjord ecosystems. These
efforts are being led by the Institute of
Marine Research. The aim is to understand the causal factors behind changes
in fjord ecosystems, with a particular


-----

focus on Porsangerfjorden. The
programme will play an important
role in generating knowledge to be used
in the management of our coastal waters.

�� _The establishment of an environmental_
_specimen bank of ecological toxins:_
Possible locations for the environmental
specimen bank are being considered by
the Norwegian Pollution Control
Authority. One alternative is co-location
with the marine biobank Marbank, which
is already established in Tromsø.

**1.2  Establishing new technical research**
**infrastructure**

**_1.2.1 Establishing an Arctic earth_**
**_observing system in Svalbard_**
The establishment of the Svalbard Integrated
Arctic Earth Observing System (SIOS) is a
major pan-European infrastructure project in
Svalbard. It will be an important element in
the Government’s efforts to achieve the objectives of its High North policy. The project
will increase the scientific value of monitoring
and research activities, and reduce the risk of
overlap and unnecessary environmental pressure in Svalbard. It will also play an important
role in promoting international research cooperation and coordination in Svalbard. This
centre of expertise will provide a basis for research cooperation, teaching and knowledge
transfer, and will create a joint Arctic platform
for climate-related research in Europe.

The Government will give high priority to the
SIOS. Establishing the system will involve
upgrading existing and providing new infrastructure, particularly at the Svalbard Science


Centre in Longyearbyen, which is responsible
for collecting data from land, sea, ice and air/
atmosphere, and establishing a knowledge
centre to make the data accessible. The
project will promote international cooperation
and coordination, and increase the value of
research activities.

**_1.2.2  Building a next-generation radar_**
**_system in the High North (EISCAT 3-D)_**
EISCAT (European Incoherent Scatter)
installations are large radar systems located
in northern Scandinavia. They are used for
geophysical research by researchers from
many countries, and are useful for a number
of purposes related to space research, climate
research and monitoring of “space weather”.
There is now an urgent need to upgrade the
radars on the mainland, both because they
are beginning to be outdated and because
the radio frequency bands they operate on
are to be taken over by mobile telephony and
digital radio broadcasting. EISCAT 3-D is a
project to set up a new EISCAT radar system
in northern Scandinavia. The project proposal
includes at least one new active phased-array
radar illuminator (transmitter/receiver) and
two to four new passive receiver arrays. Possible locations for the transmitter are Ramfjordmoen near Tromsø, where the existing
transmitter is located, or a location close to
Andøya Rocket Range. Receivers will be built
in northern Sweden and northern Finland,
and possibly one in Sweden and one at Masi
in Finnmark county.

The new EISCAT 3-D system will play a key
role in climate change research. The radars
will provide data that are important for the
atmosphere-based platform that forms part of


-----

the Svalbard Integrated Arctic Earth Observing
System. In addition to facilitating scientific advances, EISCAT 3-D will promote technological
development and could potentially lead to new
business innovation.

**_1.2.3  A new ice-class research vessel_**
Increased value creation in polar areas and
accelerating climate change have made it essential to develop more and better knowledge of
these areas. Such knowledge is necessary as a
basis for making decisions related to resource
management, environmental policy and value
creation. The Government intends to facilitate
the development of knowledge about Arctic and
Antarctic sea areas and to step up Norway’s
year-round presence in the Arctic. An active
presence in these areas is of great importance
in giving Norway legitimacy, credibility and
influence as a steward of the marine resources
and marine environment of the northern seas,
and in enabling Norway to contribute to international cooperation on the management of the
Southern Ocean.

The Arctic and Antarctic play a key role in the
global climate system. Climate change is now
high on the political agenda, and ice melting is
one of the keys to understanding future climate
trends. An ice-class research vessel would
enable Norway to make important scientific
contributions to international climate cooperation by enhancing the country’s research efforts
in Arctic and Antarctic sea areas.

There is a need to strengthen marine research
and monitoring of the northern sea areas, partly
to monitor changes in the biological resources
directly associated with the sea ice, such as
polar bears, Arctic cod, zooplankton and algae.


This means that it must be possible to take
samples in the ice, under the ice and below
the water surface, as well as from animals and
birds on the surface or in the air.

Because climate change is affecting sea
temperatures and the marine environment,
marine research and monitoring of the northern sea areas should be stepped up, for example to monitor changes in the populations
and migration patterns of marine species.
Data collected by a research vessel would
be important in providing the best possible
knowledge base for determining quotas and
in enabling us to meet our international obligations as regards the management of joint
stocks. A new research vessel would also play
a key role in improving maritime monitoring,
which will become more important as a result
of increasing petroleum activity in the north.

The existing Norwegian research vessels are
to some extent outdated, and only two of them
are ice-class vessels. The marine research
community in Norway has recommended that
the top priority should be to procure a new
ice-class marine research vessel.

A new ice-class research vessel would constitute one element of a research platform
for fields such as the environment, climate,
natural resources, polar research, fisheriesrelated and marine research, geological and
petroleum-related research, and other areas.
The knowledge obtained would improve the
basis for making decisions related to natural
resource management, and climate and environmental policy in the polar seas.


-----

The Government aims to acquire a new vessel
of this kind, provided that our quality requirements are met, during the next few years.
This vessel would operate from Tromsø. The
final decision on procurement and specifications will be made following the completion of
a quality assurance process.

**1.3  Mapping the diversity of the seabed**
The Government will facilitate the development of management-oriented knowledge.
MAREANO is a programme for systematic
surveys and basic research on physical, biological and chemical conditions on the seabed
in all Norwegian coastal and marine areas.
All data are collected in a single database.
The MAREANO programme is a pioneer in
the field of mapping. The knowledge generated by the programme will be important
for finding a good balance between use and
conservation and between the interests of
various users. The programme also offers a
unique platform for exploring opportunities
for marine bioprospecting.

The Government will continue the MAREANO programme. The first phase of MAREANO has been designed to be used in the
2010 revision of the integrated management
plan for the Barents Sea–Lofoten area. MAREANO is intended to cover the southern part
of the Barents Sea including the Lofoten and
Vesterålen islands by the end of 2010. Priority
areas are Eggakanten, Tromsøflaket, Troms
II and Nordland VII. At the current level of
funding, the mapping of the areas that are
indicated in the integrated management plan
will be concluded in 2014 at the earliest.


**2. IMPROVING MONITORING,**
**EMERGENCY RESPONSE AND MARITIME**
**SAFETY SYSTEMS IN NORTHERN WATERS**

Melting of the Arctic sea ice during the summer
will make new areas accessible for human activity. The volume of maritime traffic in the High
North will increase with the opening of shipping
routes via Arctic waters and the expansion of oil
and gas extraction in Norwegian and Russian
waters. A higher volume of traffic will pose
considerable challenges to Norway as a coastal
state with a special responsibility for management in the High North. This will require
improved monitoring, emergency response and
maritime safety systems in our northern sea
areas. It will also be important to maintain our
high health, safety and environmental standards
as petroleum activity in the northern sea areas
increases.

With increasing activity in Arctic and other
northern waters, existing emergency response
systems should be reviewed. Norway will seek
to promote regional cooperation, for example
within the framework of the Arctic Council, on
search and rescue cooperation in these waters.

**2.1 Establishing an integrated monitoring**
**and notification system**
Access to integrated information is necessary
for sound management of the northern sea
areas and the Arctic. Integrated real time information is also essential for dealing with environmental and other disasters in these areas.

Various systems already exist for monitoring
maritime traffic, the fishing fleet, the marine
environment, meteorological conditions and
so on. However, there is no overall coordination


-----

of these systems. The Ministry of Fisheries
and Coastal Affairs, in cooperation with the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, has launched
efforts to develop an integrated monitoring
and notification system. In principle, this
should build further on the existing systems.
An integrated national web-based system
would receive data from the various sectoral
systems, for example on the environment,
marine resources, oil and gas activities, and
fisheries, and offer users a complete overview
of relevant information about the northern
sea areas. The system would provide public
bodies with a better and more complete overview for management purposes, and private
sector users with more readily accessible and
more complete information. The establishment of such a system will be important at national level and will also have a clear foreign
policy dimension. The EU and other countries
are also considering similar systems, but
the Norwegian system will be a pioneering
project. The Government will continue the
development of a more integrated monitoring
and notification system.

**2.2 Improving pollution and emergency**
**response systems**

**_2.2.1 Further developing the Norwegian_**
**_Coastal Administration’s maritime safety_**
**_expertise_**
The growing volume of maritime transport
in the High North means that maritime
safety and oil spill response must be given
high priority. It is necessary to focus both on
preventive measures to reduce the probability
of accidents and on measures to reduce their
impact. This will make it possible for maritime transport to coexist satisfactorily with


other industries such as fisheries and tourism, and play a role in their further development. Weather conditions in the High North
are difficult, with low temperatures, ice, and
darkness during the winter. Norway has
taken on a special responsibility in this field
in connection with the development of the
integrated management plan for the Barents
Sea–Lofoten area. This needs to be followed
up and further developed, both nationally and
in an international context.

Norway is today a world leader with expertise
on oil spill response equipment and its industrial development. The Government wants to
further develop the Coastal Administration’s
expertise in this area with a view to strengthening maritime safety, maritime monitoring
and expertise on oil spill response in icy
conditions. The Coastal Administration is responsible for addressing and highlighting the
new challenges and tasks in the north, and for
further developing its cutting-edge expertise
in emergency response and pollution prevention in Arctic areas. One of its key tasks will
be to follow up international efforts and take
part in practical cooperation with Russia and
other countries in the field of oil spill preparedness and monitoring of Arctic areas.
The Coastal Administration should also be
given a particular responsibility for monitoring risk trends in this area. Cooperation with
other entities is also important. Furthermore,
the Coastal Administration should assess
development needs and coordinate new
research in this field in cooperation with
other actors such as research institutions, oil
companies, other industries and international
partners. The expertise the Coastal Administration has established in Finnmark county


-----

should be further developed. As regards
knowledge building in cooperation with
Russia, it is appropriate that the Vessel Traffic
Service Centre in Vardø is involved.

**_2.2.2 Improving maritime safety_**
Climate change may result in a growing volume of maritime transport and opportunities
for using new transport corridors. Increasing
oil and gas extraction will also mean more
maritime traffic in the High North. This will
have implications for infrastructure, oil spill
response and maritime safety, and cooperation with other countries.

As a shipping nation, Norway must be able
to deal with any adverse impacts of maritime
transport along its coast. If Norway proves
not to have the capacity to deal with accidents
in Arctic waters, this would not only lead to
pollution damage, but would also tarnish
Norway’s reputation and jeopardise business
development in the north. As a coastal state,
Norway must therefore focus both on improving maritime safety and on reducing the
impacts of any accidents through an adequate
oil spill response system. The goal is to scale
up response capacity in step with the expansion of petroleum and other activities.

The Government attaches importance to
maritime monitoring and satisfactory information about maritime traffic and other
activities in our neighbouring areas. This is
important both to enable Norway to protect
its strategic interests and to ensure a high
level of maritime safety, adequate response
systems and sound management. Norway’s
recognition of the need for maritime monitoring and adequate information is reflected in


the project to establish an integrated monitoring and notification system, as discussed in
section 2.1 above. The Vessel Traffic Service
Centre in Vardø, which was established in
2007, is one concrete element of these efforts.
The Vessel Traffic Service uses automatic
identification system (AIS) to monitor shipping
and ensure compliance with the mandatory
routeing and traffic separation scheme between
Vardø and Røst. In this connection it is also
important to further develop Norway’s close
cooperation with Russia on maritime safety
and oil spill response. One element here is the
ongoing development of a joint notification and
information system for shipping. Cooperation is
also underway to improve electronic navigation
signal coverage in the Barents Sea by linking
the Norwegian Loran-C system and the equivalent Russian Chaika system. Norway is also
cooperating with Iceland and a number of other
countries around the North Sea on establishing a regional centre to coordinate information
on maritime traffic in the northern part of the
North Atlantic and in the Barents Sea. Canada
could also become an important partner here.

In recent years, maritime traffic off Svalbard,
particularly cruise traffic, has been increasing.
In contrast to the situation along the Norwegian mainland coast, there is no AIS coverage
in the waters off Svalbard. The Government is
considering establishing AIS coverage around
Svalbard to enable the authorities to monitor the growing maritime traffic and make it
possible to take action against ships that pose
a threat to safety and the environment. In line
with the Government’s High North Strategy,
the Ministry of Fisheries and Coastal Affairs
has also made the Harbour Act applicable to
Svalbard. Given Svalbard’s geographical loca

-----

tion and the increase in maritime traffic, the
Government sees a need for further measures
to ensure a satisfactory level of maritime
safety in the area.

The current focus on building up expertise
and education in maritime disciplines and air
safety at the University of Trondheim and
several university colleges is important in this
connection.

A key objective of the Government’s maritime strategy is to facilitate environmentally
sound growth in the maritime sector. The
Research Council of Norway and Innovation
Norway will be given funds to promote more
environmentally sound maritime transport.
In its dialogue with the sector, the Government has designated key areas for maritime
research and development. Priority will be
given to reducing the environmental impact
of maritime operations under difficult conditions, for example in the High North, and to
advanced logistics and transport. As a result
of the geographical location of Norway’s sea
areas and the prevailing weather conditions,
the Norwegian maritime sector has developed particular expertise and comparative
advantages as regards challenging maritime
operations in a cold climate. Norway intends
to consolidate its position as an innovative
maritime nation. Support has therefore been
given for a pilot project in connection with the
establishment of a next generation research
laboratory centre.

Norway plays an active part in the International Maritime Organization (IMO) which
establishes safety and environmental standards for maritime transport. Norway has been


calling for the IMO to put the Arctic Ocean
and related issues and the development of
legislation higher on its agenda. The IMO has
started revision of the Polar Code, a set of
guidelines for ships operating in polar waters.
The Government will advocate making the
Polar Code binding.

**_2.2.3  Strengthening the oil spill response_**
Since 2003, a government emergency tugboat
service has been operative from Finnmark
county to the Lofoten Islands. There are
plans to strengthen this service from 2010, by
increasing the number of all-year tugboats to
three. Funding will be provided by the Ministry of Fisheries and Coastal Affairs. Weather
conditions in the north are harsh, and change
rapidly. The established traffic lanes are
located far enough from the coast to allow
for sufficient response time for tugboats and
other assistance, but close enough for ships
that run into problems to reach port. The
Government is drawing up an updated list of
suitable ports of refuge in cooperation with
relevant parties, including the municipalities.

Increasing petroleum activity in the north and
the growing number of oil shipments from
northwestern Russia past the Norwegian
coast mean that there will be a continuous
need for development, coordination and
innovation. Existing oil spill response equipment has clear limitations in low temperatures and ice-infested waters. It is therefore
necessary to develop methods and equipment
for oil spill clean-up operations that are suited
to such conditions. According to an Arctic
Council report, oil spills are the greatest
threat to the marine environment in Arctic
areas. Cooperation on this issue, both as


-----

regards research and response measures, are
proposed as an important priority area. The
Government intends to strengthen the oil
spill response in the north.

An overall analysis of future oil spill response
requirements is needed, and should consider
both technological development and capacity.
To deal with the challenges ahead, it will be
important to have a good overview of existing
oil spill response systems as a basis for assessing what needs to be done. The goal must
be to strengthen the existing system, both in
coastal waters and in sea areas further north.
An overall approach including both public
and private response systems is needed. The
Ministry of Fisheries and Coastal Affairs has
initiated a process that will form the basis for
work in this field. In cooperation with other
ministries and agencies, it will make an overview of knowledge gaps and ongoing and new
research projects and studies in the fields of
maritime safety and emergency response,
focusing particularly on oil-in-ice problems.
Several private initiatives in Norway may also
provide more knowledge about dealing with
oil spills in Arctic waters. In 2006, SINTEF,
with support from the petroleum industry,
launched an R&D programme focused on oil
spills in ice-infested waters. The Ministry of
Fisheries and Coastal Affairs will evaluate the
results of this and other relevant projects as
part of its follow-up of the Government’s responsibility for the response system for acute
pollution. The Ministry will also determine
the need for further research and development in this field and consider providing
government support for R&D projects to
build competence and develop equipment
for use in the oil spill response in the High


North. In addition to private R&D efforts, there
may be a need for government support for the
development of equipment and expertise in the
field of oil spill response in Arctic areas. On the
basis of research in this field, the Government
will determine capacity requirements for the oil
spill response system in the High North.

The Government is also in the process of developing safety and emergency response requirements for the petroleum industry in the High
North. The Ministry of Fisheries and Coastal
Affairs, the Ministry of the Environment and
the Ministry of Petroleum and Energy are all
key actors in this work, and ensuring close
coordination between these ministries and
private actors is an important concern. In the
Government’s view, a broad-based emergency
response forum is needed to ensure smooth
cooperation between all the actors involved,
both public and private. The Ministry of Fisheries and Coastal Affairs will take an initiative
for the establishment of such a forum, where
input from all parties should be considered and
coordinated before recommendations are sent
to the Government.

**3. PROMOTING SUSTAINABLE USE**
**OF OFFSHORE PETROLEUM AND**
**RENEWABLE MARINE RESOURCES**

Since time immemorial the fisheries have been
of fundamental importance to the economy
and settlement of the northernmost parts of
Norway. They have provided a vital basis for
the development of local communities. In the
future, too, marine resources will continue to
be important for business development and
employment in the north. Long-term, sustainable resource management will help to secure
further development and prosperity for coming
generations. At the same time it is necessary to
facilitate the use of new resources and development of new products by focusing on research
and development. This is important in order
to ensure that Northern Norway develops a
more differentiated and robust business sector.
Farming of new marine species, marine bioprospecting and petroleum activity in the north
may play a major role in the further development of Northern Norway.

Developing Northern Norway’s own resources
will provide an important basis for value creation in the High North. Experience has shown
that the petroleum industry generates substantial economic growth at national, regional and
local level. There is now considerable interest
and optimism in our northern counties related
to the development of the High North as a
petroleum province.

Petroleum extraction is dependent on exploration and the discovery of deposits. The ripple
effects of the petroleum industry on the rest
of the economy is contingent on access to new
areas for oil and gas extraction, and vice versa.


It is therefore important that Norwegian
policy is designed to make the High North
attractive to oil companies so that they give it
priority in their portfolios. At the same time
the Government is seeking to identify modes
of field development solutions that maximise local and regional ripple effects while
maintaining corporate and macroeconomic
profitability. Several other countries that are
engaged in petroleum activities in the High
North are focusing on technological development and research related to petroleum activities in the Arctic. The Norwegian strategic
task force for oil and gas research, OG21,
has developed a technology strategy for the
Arctic. Norway is engaged in dialogue on this
issue with other countries.

Maritime transport changes in response to
general economic development in Norway
and the rest of the world. For example, an
expansion of petroleum activities in northwestern Russia, the Norwegian Sea and the
Barents Sea will lead to a growth in maritime
transport. As a result of the geographical location of Norway’s sea areas and the prevailing
weather conditions, the Norwegian maritime
sector has developed particular expertise and
comparative advantages as regards challenging maritime operations in cold climates. The
petroleum industry is a source of innovation
and motivation for onshore maritime industries. Shipyards are building both vessels
and installations for the offshore sector. This
work also involves subcontractors, service
providers and other activities connected with
shipbuilding.

Presence and activity have an impact on
resource management, the environment and


-----

foreign relations. The Government uses the
integrated management plan for the Barents
Sea–Lofoten area to facilitate value creation
based on the sustainable use of resources
and coexistence between industries such
as the fisheries, maritime transport and the
petroleum sector. The Government’s aim is to
provide clear and forward-looking framework
conditions for existing and future activities in
the High North.

**3.1 Developing marine industries**

**_3.1.1 A national initiative for cod farming_**
Capture fisheries have reached a ceiling, and
we will not see any significant increase in
global fish catches in the years ahead. An increase in the supply of seafood must therefore
come from an increase in aquaculture production. Norway has strong competitive advantages as regards cod farming due to its long
coastline, its expertise on marine species and
its experience of salmon and trout farming.
Conditions in Northern Norway are particularly good for cod farming. Farmed cod thrive
better in the cold water in the north than they
do further south, and there are larger areas
available for cod farming along the coast
in the north. In recent years, the relevant
research infrastructure in Tromsø has been
upgraded with the addition of the Norwegian
Cod Breeding Centre, the Tromsø Aquaculture Research Station and the Fish Health
Laboratory at Kårvika. These facilities are
all wholly or partially owned by the national
industry-oriented research group Nofima,
which has its headquarters in Tromsø. Its
subsidiary Nofima Marin, which is Europe’s
largest unit for applied marine research, is
also based in Tromsø. All in all, Tromsø now


has world-class infrastructure with cuttingedge expertise in the field of applied research
on cod. In addition, the Institute of Marine Research has a branch in Tromsø. Much of the
required industry- and management-oriented
research can therefore be carried out in the
north.

A further development of cod farming will
help to ensure a stable and predictable supply of fish to the onshore industry in the
north outside the seasonal wild fisheries and
thereby also help to ensure employment in
the region. The Government will therefore
facilitate a national drive to develop cod farming.

Developing farming of a new species until it is
fully commercialised is knowledge-intensive
and costly. Since 2001 the authorities have
provided funding through Innovation Norway
and the Research Council of Norway in a
targeted effort. In recent years Investinor and
the marine value creation programme have
also been set up as key tools in the effort to
develop cod farming.

There are, however, still many unresolved
questions connected with cod farming. This
applies for example to interactions between
farmed and wild fish, diseases and welfare,
breeding, feeding technology and development of feed, and market-related issues.
More knowledge is also needed about the
consequences for the economy of the coastal
Sami. More research is needed in all of these
fields. So is research aimed at developing a
sustainable management regime. There are
also gaps in our knowledge of the possible
impacts of cod farming on ecosystems and


-----

wild stocks. Such knowledge is also important
for environmental impact assessments, which
are required before a decision to expand cod
farming. Impact assessments must include the
impacts of escapes and spawning in net pens
on wild stocks, the spread of diseases and more
assessment of more “ordinary” factors related
to spatial planning/localisation, parasite issues
and discharges of nutrients. There is also a
need for industry-oriented research to improve
aquaculture operations, including new technical
solutions, better feed, more effective responses
to diseases, etc.

**_3.1.2 A national initiative for marine_**
**_bioprospecting_**
Marine plants, animals and bacteria are genetically adapted to a life in the ocean in fierce
competition with other organisms, often at
temperatures close to freezing point. They contain molecules with unique properties that may
be of use to human beings, for example in new
medicines and in connection with oil production. Marine bioprospecting means searching
for and carrying out research on such substances. There is considerable potential for the
commercialisation of research findings in this
field. Marine bioprospecting could become an
important area within biotechnology, and may
have commercial potential in a number of other
areas. Applications might include medicines,
flavours and nutrients in food and feed, and industrial processes for the production of textiles,
cellulose and biomass/renewable energy, as
well as applications in the oil industry.

Norway’s prospects of success in marine
bioprospecting are based on two key factors.
Firstly, the end products developed through
research on marine organisms can be used


in many fields, and demand for such products will generate large revenues. Secondly,
Norway has marine resources with unique
properties, cutting-edge expertise and established infrastructure on which we can build
further. This puts us in a good position to
develop the whole value chain from prospecting and research to business development
via innovation and commercialisation. In the
north we have the combination of unique
Arctic resources, marine industries with long
traditions and well-established research communities. Important infrastructure is already
in place, for example the Marbank marine
biobank, the MarBio laboratory and the
MabCent centre for research-based innovation. The MABIT programme, an independent
industry-oriented R&D programme, plays an
important role. We are now also seeing the
emergence of a new generation of biotechnology companies in the north.

Marine bioprospecting is an element in the
Government’s innovation policy. The idea
behind this is to further develop our key
industries and make use of the conjunction of
advantages, both those we have acquired by
building knowledge and natural advantages.
As the world economy becomes increasingly globalised, international competition is
hardening. We must be capable of renewing
ourselves and ensuring our competitiveness
if we are to maintain our high standard of living. A lot of challenges need to be overcome
in order to realise untapped potential. The
public sector has an important role to play in
the initial phase before a new industry has
matured.


-----

The Government intends to launch a national
initiative for marine bioprospecting. The
Government’s committee of experts on the
High North has played an important advisory
role in the process of identifying the best
solutions for promoting marine bioprospecting. The Ministry of Trade and Industry and
the Ministry of Fisheries and Coastal Affairs,
together with the Ministry of Education
and Research and the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs, have been tasked with developing
the Government’s national marine biotechnology strategy. This will be based on proposals
from the committee of experts, the Research
Council of Norway, Innovation Norway and
the Industrial Development Corporation of
Norway, and is to focus particularly on marine
bioprospecting.

The strategy will discuss the best ways of
making use of the opportunities that are
emerging in this field. A key task will be
to look into ways of improving interaction
between research and the business sector at
the regional, national and international level.
This will include considering how to facilitate
commercialisation and how the process of
developing Marbank into a national marine
biobank can be used to provide research
communities and other users with effective
access to marine biological material. It will
be necessary to develop guidelines for use of
the biobank’s material and resolve biosecurity issues related to products resulting from
marine bioprospecting.

**_3.1.3  Exploring the potential of bioenergy_**
**_based on marine algae_**
The cultivation of marine algae in coastal areas in the north could provide a future source


of bioenergy. Although seaweed farming
offers a large energy potential in theory, it is
still very uncertain whether farmed algae will
be competitive as a raw material for energy
production. Periods of high oil prices and
more stringent regulation of greenhouse gas
emissions have sparked renewed interest in
energy production based on algae. Some research on the cultivation of marine algae and
their use for bioenergy is being conducted under programmes run by the Research Council
of Norway. The Government intends to commission a study of the potential of bioenergy
based on marine algae, with a particular focus
on how a future initiative in this field could
provide a basis for business and research
activities in the north. Any future initiative in
this field must be based on close coordination
between national and international research
communities, energy companies and the
authorities.

**_3.1.4  Combating illegal, unreported and_**
**_unregulated (IUU) fishing_**
The Government intends to continue its efforts to combat IUU fishing to ensure the sustainable management of our fisheries resources. A satisfactory control regime both at sea
and when catches are landed is an essential
basis for sustainable use of the fisheries resources in the north. The Coast Guard plays
a key role in monitoring fisheries activities
at sea. The Directorate of Fisheries and the
sales organisations carry out controls of landings and compliance with quotas at national
level. Combating IUU fishing in the Barents
Sea is a long-term process that requires
further development of the policy and institutional cooperation forums Norway has helped
to develop in recent years. The Russian and


-----

Norwegian fisheries authorities have made it
clear they would like to strengthen the institutions for bilateral management cooperation that
have been developed over many years. Steps to
improve coordination between the Norwegian
and Russian law enforcement authorities must
continue. The Government will give priority
to controlling resource utilisation to combat
IUU activities, as well as to confidence building
measures and information work.

**3.2  Developing maritime business**
**activities**

**_3.2.1  Developing Norwegian ports and sup-_**
**_ply industry in connection with a possible_**
**_opening of new sea routes in the north_**
Ice melt in the Arctic is likely to result in a larger volume of maritime transport and the opening of new traffic corridors. For example, it may
become possible to use new transport corridors
from the US west coast and north-eastern Asia
through the Arctic Ocean as alternatives to the
existing corridors through the Panama and
Suez Canals. Expansion of oil and gas extraction in the north will also lead to more maritime
transport along the coast of Norway.

The increase in shipping could lead to positive
ripple effects as there will be an increasing
need for maritime service suppliers in Norway.
The most important maritime services are
related to ship financing, marine insurance,
maritime law, classification, port services and
brokerage. Many Norwegian maritime services
suppliers are today among the largest and most
important in the world in a number of fields. It
is particularly important that Norwegian ports
in the north position themselves and engage
in relevant cooperation to attract activity. The


Norwegian authorities will monitor developments and, if necessary, take steps to ensure
that the infrastructure along the coast is
adapted to an increase in the activity level.
The Ministry of Fisheries and Coastal Affairs
has tasked the Coastal Administration with
coordinating cooperation between the ports
in Northern Norway. These efforts must
include an assessment of the potential of the
various ports, such as their strategic location,
water depths, etc. and existing infrastructure.
The coordination role involves facilitating dialogue between the ports and putting common
challenges and possible solutions related to
transport development in the High North on
the agenda. Specific cooperation projects with
Russian partners may also be considered. The
Government wishes to promote increased
activity and value creation on the Norwegian
side of the border.

An increase in maritime traffic in the north
is also likely to create a greater need for
onshore maritime industries in Norway, for
example shipyards and producers of ships’
equipment. Shipyards build and repair both
vessels and offshore installations. This work
also involves subcontractors and other activities connected with shipbuilding and repair.

**_3.2.2  Developing expertise on maritime_**
**_activity in Arctic areas_**
It is the Government’s goal that Norway
should have world-class expertise on
maritime activity in Arctic areas. Increasing
activity in the High North increases the need
for knowledge and provides opportunities
for maritime operations in Arctic areas. The
Centre for High North Logistics has already
been established in Kirkenes as a cooperation


-----

project between the shipping industry, Bodø
University College, the Norwegian School
of Management and the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs.

The Government proposes to strengthen
Arctic expertise and promote specific projects
related to safe and environmentally friendly
shipping in the High North. This a strategic
priority in the Government’s High North
policy. It is important to ensure that Norway
is a world leader as regards maritime expertise in this field. These efforts will also be in
line with the Government’s maritime strategy.
The University of Tromsø, in cooperation
with Maritime Forum North and the Norwegian Shipowners’ Association, has developed a maritime Arctic expertise programme.
The programme is intended to increase the
level of expertise among masters and operators of ships and offshore installations in
Arctic waters and set safety standards for
operations in these areas.

The Government intends to enhance expertise related to safe and environmentally
friendly shipping in the High North in cooperation with the maritime expert communities
in Tromsø and Bodø.

**_3.2.3  Satellite-based automatic ship_**
**_identification_**
A satellite-based automatic ship identification
system (AIS) will be an important part of the
integrated monitoring and notification system
for the northern sea areas, and is a central
element in the Government’s High North
policy. It also has an important commercial
dimension. The Norwegian space industry
is playing a key role in the development of


satellite-based AIS. This system will provide
a better overview of shipping in Norwegian
sea areas. This is particularly important in
the High North, where a harsh climate, long
distances and a vulnerable environment are
creating new demands as regards monitoring.
In order to make correct decisions, it is important that reliable and updated information
is available. Satellite-based AIS will improve
monitoring of maritime traffic in the north
and prevention and follow-up of environmental crime at sea, and will also make it possible
to respond more quickly and effectively to
accidents. The Government is giving high
priority to the development of a satellite-based
automatic information system.

**3.3  Developing petroleum-based**
**business activities**

**_3.3.1  Developing a knowledge base for_**
**_petroleum activities in the north_**
It has been estimated that a large share of
the world’s remaining recoverable petroleum
resources are located in the High North, but
it is unclear how large this share is. So far,
one field in the Barents Sea has been developed, and a number of discoveries have been
made in the north. It is expected that more
commercially viable discoveries will be made
in Norwegian areas in the north as well.

The question of how large the Norwegian
petroleum resources are is not just a national
concern, but is also important in terms of
meeting the increasing international demand
for energy. Developing the knowledge base
related to the resource potential in the High
North will help to provide a basis for making
assessments concerning Norway’s presence.


-----

The integrated management plan for the
Barents Sea–Lofoten area, which is intended
to provide the framework for petroleum
activities in the sea areas in the north, will be
updated in 2010. Knowledge about possible
petroleum resources in the management plan
area, together with improved knowledge of
the environment, will form part of the basis
for decision-making when the framework for
petroleum activities is reassessed in 2010.

The Government intends to launch projects
with the aim of gaining an overview of existing knowledge and generating new knowledge that can serve as a basis for activity
in the north. This will, among other things,
entail a long-term and continuous process of
collecting data in the relevant area in order
to increase our knowledge about Norway’s
petroleum potential in the north. Mapping resources and improving our understanding of
the High North, will involve a number of data
collection projects, including in the northern
part of the Barents Sea.

**_3.3.2  Encouraging regional ripple effects_**
**_from petroleum activities in the north_**
Economic activity and business development
play a crucial role in ensuring welfare and
employment in the north. The petroleum
industry can increase welfare by providing capital, employment and competencebuilding. The Government will seek to ensure
that petroleum activities become a driving
force of business development and economic
activity in Northern Norway. Experience has
shown that petroleum-related industry has
developed in geographical proximity to the
offshore petroleum industry, and it has gradually moved north as new areas have been


opened. As petroleum activities in the north
have so far been limited, so have the ripple
effects.

The Government wishes to create conditions
that encourage the generation of ripple effects
by petroleum activities in the north and that
stimulate other business activities, including
ones that use petroleum as an input factor.
It is very important to identify the conditions that encourage the generation of ripple
effects by petroleum activities in the region.
The Ministry of Petroleum and Energy is
therefore planning a study aimed at identifying the links between petroleum activities and
ripple effects, as well as the conditions that
have a bearing on the possible links between
petroleum activities and other commercial
activities. This could help to promote activity
and presence in the north.

Well developed infrastructure is essential for
realising the potential oil and gas have for
generating desired value creation onshore.
New transport routes can give rise to new
business activity. Important efforts are being
made together with actors on both sides of
the Norwegian-Russian border to identify
industry needs and strengthen Northern
Norway’s comparative advantages. These
efforts will build further on existing cooperation forums, the Russians’ development of
the Northern Sea Route and the experience
gained in connection with the Northern
Maritime Corridor project. They will be based
on cooperation between national and regional
authorities that administer relevant public
support schemes, private companies and the
Centre for High North Logistics in Kirkenes
and Bodø.


-----

In addition to facilitating petroleum activities it is important to develop local education
institutions in order to build competence in
the region. Studies of the petroleum industry
have shown that supplier networks play an
important role in promoting local suppliers.
It is important that they are strengthened so
they provide effective forums where oil companies and local suppliers can meet.

**_3.3.3  Assessing alternative locations for_**
**_petroleum bases in eastern Finnmark_**
In the long term, an increase in petroleum
activities in the Norwegian and Russian parts
of the Barents Sea may create a need for
onshore support functions. It would therefore
be useful to assess alternative locations for
bases in the eastern part of Finnmark county
that could provide services to petroleum
operations in the Norwegian part of the
Barents Sea or in Russian areas. In this connection it would be useful to assess locations
for possible ports, including water depths, as
well as the possibility of using and developing
existing infrastructure.

Preferably, an assessment of alternative
locations for bases should be based on given
parameters as regards the scope of the petroleum activities, and possible locations should
be considered on the basis of specific criteria
such as geographical and economic viability.
The aim is to study three or four possible
base locations using the same criteria. The
Government wants such a study as a basis for
considering locations for the establishment
of one or more petroleum bases in eastern
Finnmark.


**4.  PROMOTING ONSHORE BUSINESS**
**DEVELOPMENT IN THE NORTH**

The Government will strengthen its focus on
onshore activities in the north. Fish processing,
tourism, mineral-related industries, environmental technology and biotechnology are
important onshore priority areas and will play a
key role in the development of the knowledgebased economy of the future. By focusing on
onshore business development we will create a
sounder basis for exploiting the full potential of
the north – both offshore and onshore.

Given that Norway has an open and exportoriented economy, we must make better use of
all parts of the country if we are to maintain the
current high level of growth and development.
Innovation and restructuring are essential if our
society is to have a competitive business sector
in the future. The Government’s efforts take
our advantages, both those we have acquired
by building knowledge and those conferred by
nature, as a starting point. The Government is
giving priority to providing framework conditions that are conducive to innovation today in
order to promote sustainable development in
the future. It is important to design an innovation policy that takes account of the unique
opportunities offered by Northern Norway.
Providing a boost for innovation in the business
sector in Northern Norway including the Sami
industries is a key element of the High North
Strategy. It is also dealt with in some detail in
the Government’s white paper on innovation,
which was presented in the autumn of 2008. It
will be further discussed in the upcoming white
paper on regional policy. The intention is to
make use of Northern Norway’s natural advantages to strengthen our competitive basis and


-----

increase value creation. The Government’s aim
is that everyone should be free to settle where
they wish, and to utilise the potential for value
creation in all parts of the country.

**4.1  Developing tourism**
In its national tourism strategy Valuable Experiences, the Government sets out its objectives
for the tourism industry and outlines measures
for realising them. Tourism has considerable
potential for value creation and is often singled out as one of the important comparative
advantages of the High North in connection
with future business development. The High
North is a region of great cultural diversity,
with vast undisturbed wilderness areas that are
well suited for adventure tourism. The Government attaches importance to protecting the
natural environment in Northern Norway and
Svalbard, where some of the last remaining
large wilderness areas in our part of the world
are to be found. Particularly high environmental standards have been set for Svalbard, with
a focus on protecting undisturbed areas. This
is an important framework condition for the
business sector. To enable the High North to
continue to make use of its strategic advantages
as a destination that offers unique experiences
in the future, we must safeguard the natural
and cultural heritage of the region.

The High North has huge untapped potential
as a tourist destination, but tourism in this
region requires more in terms of organisation
and knowledge that tourism in areas with a less
harsh climate. In order to ensure that today’s
opportunities lead to value creation in the
future, the Government will promote tourism
in the High North by focusing on the following
strategic priority areas:


_�������������������������������������������_
_as a destination:_
There is a general lack of knowledge
about Northern Norway as a tourist
destination. A company for coordinating
the marketing and branding of Northern
Norway abroad is currently being established. Examples of iconic tourist attractions that have already been established
are the Hurtigruten Coastal Express, Sami
communities, the Lofoten archipelago and
the North Cape. Sites that have been
included on the World Heritage List have
particular potential for local community
development and tourism. The Government’s aim is that the Norwegian World
Heritage sites should be developed as
beacons of best practice as regards
management of the natural environment
and the cultural heritage.

_��������������������������������������������_
_in the north:_
It is important to offer a wider range of
experiences. It is also important to promote cooperation between actors that
provide transport, overnight accommodation and activities so that their efforts
are more coordinated and targeted. The
natural environment and the cultural
heritage of the High North are unique,
and the quality of the tourism products in
the north depends on their preservation.

_��������������������������������������������_
_infrastructure in Northern Norway:_
In order to unleash the potential of tourism it is important to improve infrastructure. Key elements here are development
of the main airports in Northern Norway,


-----

new direct flights from the rest of Europe,
the Hurtigruten Coastal Express,
cooperation with Russia and upgrading
of the road network.

_�����������������������������������������_
_year-round tourism:_
Large seasonal variations are a critical
factor for the tourism industry, and this is
also the case in the north. Developing
year-round products would help to provide
year-round employment. Innovation and
cooperation are key in efforts to increase
value creation during the low season.

_��������������������������������������������_
_in the field of tourism – knowledge about_
_nature, protection of the natural environ-_
_ment, culture, the cultural heritage, market_
_development and product development:_
The development of expertise adapted to
challenges and opportunities in Northern
Norway could create a basis for further
business development and innovation.
Developing sustainable tourism will
require developing both expertise on
tourism and the knowledge infrastructure
related to tourism. The Government
education and research opportunities
offered in the High North in the field
of Arctic tourism, giving environmental
aspects and the development of
ecotourism a more prominent place.
These efforts will encourage centres of
expertise to cooperate with each other,
with the business sector in the region and
with partners in the circumpolar region
outside Norway. Finnmark University
College, in cooperation with centres of
expertise in Nordland and Troms coun

ties, will be the central coordinating point
for the development of higher education
in tourism in the High North. Cooperation
with national and international education
and research institutions is also important
in this connection. Raising the level of
formal qualifications can help to improve
coordination between actors in the
tourism industry and promote project
cooperation in the form of innovation,
networking and marketing. Providing
more employment for highly qualified
people is important in order to maintain
settlement patterns. It is therefore important to strengthen education and research
opportunities in the field of tourism.
Tourism is a priority theme in the knowledge infrastructure programme to boost
research in the north (see section 5.1).

**4.2  Developing mineral-based industries**
Being one of the world’s richest areas in terms
of mineral deposits, the High North is the focus
of international attention. Mapping metallic
and non-metallic raw materials will ensure that
mining continues to be an important industry
in the High North. The Government intends to
develop mineral-based industries in the north.

Through the subsidiary agency Geological
Survey of Norway, the Ministry of Trade and
Industry will work to make available necessary
basic data from geophysical mapping carried
out by planes and helicopters, including electromagnetic, magnetic and radiometric data.
The results of this mapping are expected to
provide a considerable stimulus to new mineralbased industries in the north. The project will
also lead to better management of the natural
resources in the area. Priority will be given


-----

to the interior of Finnmark county, coastal
areas of western Finnmark, coastal areas in
the western part of Troms county, parts of the
Lofoten-Vesterålen archipelago and the areas
Rombak-Ballangen-Tysfjord in the northern
part of Nordland county.

**4.3  Developing expertise and business**
**activity based on Arctic conditions**
Knowledge is the key to business development in the High North. It is only by building
knowledge for, about and in the north that we
can make use of the unique opportunities these
areas offer and resolve the challenges we are
facing in the north. A qualified labour force
is crucial to the development of the business
sector and public services. The challenges
Northern Norway is facing may, nevertheless,
at the same time give the business sector in
the region a comparative advantage. However,
this requires that companies and research
institutions in Northern Norway are able to
translate the experience-based knowledge of
their employees into documented knowledge.
For example, this applies in relation to the need
for know-ledge-based business development
and the spin-off effects created by oil and gas
development in an Arctic climate.

Increasing business activity in the north, particularly in connection with petroleum activity
on the Russian side and greater demand for
transport, add to this need. The unique characteristics of the High North call for specific
expertise that must be developed, and should
be delivered, by institutions in the region. Good
educational opportunities are necessary if it is
to be attractive to live in the region. The environmental threats are transnational in nature,
and to address them, we must develop and


build knowledge, awareness and technology
in cooperation with other actors – both from
the knowledge sector and from the business
sector in the High North.

The Government intends to develop knowledge of new technology that is adapted to
Arctic conditions. Through the knowledge
infrastructure programme to boost research in
the north, under the auspices of the Research
Council of Norway, Northern Norway is now
being given the opportunity to gradually position itself as a leader in research on tourism
and Arctic technology. In cooperation with the
Ministry of the Environment and the Ministry
of Local Government and Regional Development, the Ministry of Education and Research
will launch projects aimed at coordinating and
strengthening education and research opportunities in the High North in the fields of
Arctic technology, environmental technology,
sustainable energy and Arctic business development. The establishment of a specific programme in the field of chemical oceanography
will also be considered. A long-term approach
is needed to develop strong centres of expertise and sustainable cooperation. The technological community in Narvik (the Northern
Research Institute and Narvik University
College) has, for example, been engaged in the
field of cold climate technologies since 1991.
It has expertise in hydropower, solar power/
solar panel production, wind power, bioenergy,
etc. The Cold Climate Technology Research
Centre focuses on present and future requirements for adapting structures, materials,
infrastructure and operations for use in cold
climates.

**4.4  Strengthening innovation and**
**development capacity**

**_4.4.1  An innovation boost for business_**
**_in the north_**
The northernmost part of Norway faces
challenges that make it difficult to make full
use of the region’s potential for value creation. Its business structure is characterised
by small companies that are scattered over
a large area. Industry has to a large extent
been based on raw materials. The area is
also sparsely populated. Compared with the
national average, the business innovation rate
in Northern Norway has been low. The purpose of our innovation policy is to enable us to
utilise the potential in the areas we have given
priority. These include energy, the marine and
maritime sectors, environmental technology,
mineral-related industries and tourism. The
Government’s aim is to provide framework
conditions that encourage innovation in the
business sector in the north.

In its white paper on innovation, the Government sets out that its goal is a society with
welfare schemes that are among the best in
the world, a society with competitive companies in all parts of the country, a society
that does not undermine the opportunities
of future generations. In twelve points the
Government describes how it intends to
achieve its vision of creating an innovative and
sustainable Norway. All of these measures are
relevant in Northern Norway. The efforts to
promote small and medium-sized enterprises
and develop a culture of entrepreneurship are
two good examples.


��The Government will facilitate innovation in
_small and medium-sized enterprises in all types_
_of regions_
For small and medium-sized enterprises, a
lack of expertise and economic resources is
an obstacle to innovation. Innovation Norway,
SIVA (the Industrial Development Corporation of Norway) and the Research Council of
Norway have been given the task of promoting cooperation to increase value creation.
Based on its own studies, Northern Norway
has concluded that increased onshore value
creation can be achieved by:

������������������������������������������
commercialise and internationalise new
products and industries. Relevant themes
could be marine bioprospecting, telemedicine, space activities, marine
industries, mineral resources, environmental technology, energy and tourism.

������������������������������������������
ledge clusters and networks in industries
in which the region has comparative
advantages. Examples include ARENA,
the Norwegian Centre of Expertise and
the VRI programme for regional R&D and
innovation under the auspices of the
authorities that administer relevant public
support schemes.

�����������������������������������������
velop a more market-oriented approach
among companies in Northern Norway
and help them to make better use of
their market potential, both with respect
to existing and to future products and
services.


-----

Easier access to financial support schemes will
also make it easier for small enterprises to take
the step from idea to commercialisation. Two
regional seed money funds have been set up
in Northern Norway. In 2008 the Government
also established Investinor AS, a new stateowned investment company, to ensure Norwegian companies better access to venture capital.

_���������������������������������������������_
_entrepreneurship_
In order to make it easier for good ideas to find
their way to the market, the Government will
promote a culture of entrepreneurship. We will
present an action plan for entrepreneurship,
with particular emphasis on higher education.
This will be a nationwide effort, and of great
importance to Northern Norway. Entrepreneurship programmes have already been launched
at educational institutions in Northern Norway.
The efforts to promote entrepreneurship are
essential in enabling people with the right
qualities to see opportunities, act on them and
commercialise their ideas.

Society’s ability to restructure, innovate and
adapt is essential to a future knowledge-based
and competitive economy. These qualities have
been decisive for Norway’s ability to maintain
continuous strong growth. An innovation boost
in the north is a cross-cutting effort aimed at
maintaining and increasing value creation in
the northernmost part of our country. The Master of Science programme in business at Bodø
University College will be a major contri-butor
to developing Northern Norway’s restructuring and innovation capacity. It is also important
for our High North efforts as a whole that we
further develop our expertise on Russia, as is
being done, for example, at the High North


Centre for Business at Bodø University College.

**_4.4.2  Strengthening local development_**
**_efforts_**
A number of small municipalities and local communities, particularly in Northern
Norway, are vulnerable in the face of the
global and national changes that are affecting
the labour market and the business sector,
and young people’s expectations as regards
education, employment and leisure activities.
This applies to all parts of rural Norway, but
it is particularly evident in municipalities that
have small populations and a poorly diversified
economy, and that are located far from major
centres. The Government allocates considerable funds to regional development in Northern
Norway each year.

The Ministry of Local Government and
Regional Development will implement the
Government’s policy for enhancing the
municipalities’ capacity and competence and
strengthening local development efforts.

The specific content and form of the measures
will be determined in 2009, through close
cooperation involving the Ministry of Local
Government and Regional Development,
the Ministry of the Environment, the Sami
Parliament, the Regional Development Centre,
Innovation Norway and the country authorities, and in close dialogue with the Association
of Local and Regional Authorities and the
Norwegian Trade Union Confederation. The
aim is to revitalise the municipality as a driver
of local development so that more municipalities benefit from and make effective use of the
public support schemes that are available at


-----

national and regional level. The policy is also
intended to enhance the county authorities’
ability to play a more proactive advisory and
supportive role vis-à-vis municipalities that
have great development needs, but limited
capacity and competence to address the challenges they are facing. The increased efforts
to promote local development at municipal
level should support and reinforce existing
efforts at regional level regional.

The main goals of these efforts will be to:
����������������������������������������
palities where there is little development
activity. The municipalities can focus on
addressing local challenges related to
social development in the broad sense,
or to business development more specifically (business, local community development, services, image, etc.).
���������������������������������������
expertise as regards local community
development.
�������������������������������������������
resources (local, regional and national).
�����������������������������������������
regional cooperation with the municipalities on resource use and technical support.

**5.  FURTHER DEVELOPING THE**
**INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE NORTH**

Appropriate infrastructure must be put in
place if the potential of the High North is to be
fully realised. Transport policy in the north is
important for both offshore and onshore value
creation. Oil and gas activity could become a
driving force in future economic development
in the north. It is important to create conditions


that are conducive to the establishment of the
extensive onshore activity that the petroleum
development is expected to generate, and one
element here is ensuring a reliable and secure
supply of electricity. The long distances both
within Northern Norway and from the region to
world markets pose a considerable challenge.
The fisheries and tourism industries are just
two of the sectors that are dependent on good
roads and reliable air connections in order to
reach regional, national and international markets. The Government intends to maintain and
upgrade infrastructure in the north with a view
to safeguarding industries in the region and
maintaining settlement patterns.

Many of the policy measures outlined in the
Government’s High North Strategy are concerned with knowledge building: “knowledge
is at the core of our High North efforts.” The
drivers of the knowledge building system will
be a knowledge-based business sector, research
institutions and administrative bodies, and universities and university colleges. It is important
that all of these cooperate effectively to ensure
local ownership and the strongest possible support for these measures in the north.

**5.1  Developing the knowledge**
**infrastructure**
The Government intends to strengthen and
further develop the knowledge infrastructure
in the High North. In order to generate spin-off
effects that benefit settlement patterns and business development in the north, it is essential
that the knowledge institutions in the region are
competitive, both nationally and internationally.

The University Centre in Svalbard is engaged
in research and offers education at a high


-----

academic level based on its unique location in
the Arctic. The opportunity to use nature as
a laboratory and arena for making observations and collecting and analysing data gives it
particular advantages.

In the Government’s view it is of great importance to promote the formation of networks
and division of labour between higher education institutions in the north, as elsewhere.
It also attaches importance to enhancing cooperation on knowledge building rather than
competition between the institutions. This will
in turn promote business development.

Knowledge is one of the most important
building blocks in sustainable social and
business development. The aim is to increase
knowledge-based value creation and improve
competitiveness in the north in areas where
the High has natural advantages. Northern
Norway faces challenges as regards knowledge building because its centres of expertise
are small and relatively new, because of the
vast distances and because it has limited
weight in many business contexts. These
challenges can be met through strategic
cooperation between institutions and actors in
the north. This will require closer cooperation
between the various research and educational
institutions and between centres of expertise
and the business sector than is currently the
case. The regional research funds that are
to be established from 2010 onwards will be
an important contribution to strengthening
relevant regional research.

One example of a joint strategic effort to
strengthen knowledge infrastructure across
county borders is the knowledge infrastruc

ture programme to boost research in the
north, under the auspices of the Research
Council of Norway and financed by the
Ministry of Local Government and Regional
Development. The programme is intended
to promote closer cooperation on knowledge
building and business development between
universities, university colleges and research
communities in the three northernmost
counties. Tourism and Arctic technology are
priority themes (see sections 4.1 and 4.3).

Another example of such cooperation can
be found in the energy sector in Finnmark
county: EnergiCampus NORD (ECN) in
Hammerfest was established following an
initiative taken by the Universities of Tromsø,
Trondheim and Stavanger in cooperation
with the university colleges in Finnmark and
Narvik. ECN is to offer higher education
in energy-related subjects. The basic idea
has been to set up an integrated education
programme that covers the field of energy,
natural resources and the environment, and
that draws on its proximity to relevant industry and infrastructure in Finnmark, including
the Snøhvit plant.

The establishment of the Centre for High
North Logistics is yet another good example
of cooperation between private business
actors and the public sector. This centre of
expertise for the development of sustainable
solutions for maritime transport and logistics
in the High North will be located on the axis
Murmansk-Kirkenes-Bodø. The centre was
established in 2008 as a result of cooperation
between the shipping industry (Tschudi Shipping), Bodø University College, the Norwegian School of Management and the Ministry


-----

Cooperation and coordination between higher
education institutions in Northern Norway
are important in order to create the strong
knowledge networks that are necessary for the
dynamic development of the knowledge institutions and the business sector in the north.

Producing a labour force with relevant qualifications and expertise in Northern Norway is a
challenge. There is a high drop-out rate from
upper secondary schools in Northern Norway,
and the number of applicants to several of the
university colleges is low. Measures aimed at
stimulating centres of expertise in the north
are therefore important to make it easier to
recruit and retain highly qualified personnel
and good students.

The Government intends to launch a process
to promote closer cooperation between higher
education institutions in Northern Norway with
a view to improving coordination.

**5.2  Developing the transport network**
Northern Norway is characterised by vast
distances, harsh topographic and climatic
conditions and vulnerable nature. The Government intends to develop the infrastructure in
the north as part of its efforts to make Norway
more robust and competitive in its response to
international developments in the High North.
Considerable value creation takes place in
Northern Norway. This calls for a well-functioning infrastructure. The Government will
therefore propose a number of projects aimed
at developing and modernising the transport
infrastructure in Northern Norway. These
proposals will be considered in the light of the
needs in other parts of the country.


As part of its High North Strategy, the Government will present plans for an extraordinary
strategic effort in the period 2010–2019. The
Government’s aim is to establish transport infrastructure between Norway and neighbouring
countries to link different parts of the Barents
region more closely together. Facilitating transport east–west will help to increase trade and
cooperation with our neighbouring countries.
This effort is primarily motivated by international and national concerns, but the results will
also be important for regional development in
the north.

Air transport is important in the north because of the vast distances, and there is a well
developed network of airports in the three
northernmost counties. Of Avinor’s 46 airports,
28 are located in these counties and Svalbard.
Finnmark county has 11 airports. In addition to
their importance for passenger transport, these
airports are important for air transport of fish,
for tourism and for emergency response in connection with oil and gas production.

Maritime transport is important because of the
vast distances and the population concentration
along the coast. About 50% of freight transport
between Tromsø and Finnmark is by sea. The
fisheries and aquaculture sectors are among
Norway’s most important export industries, and
they play an essential role in many local communities along the coast. As part of a strategy
aimed at promoting value creation in the fisheries sector, the Ministry of Fisheries and Coastal
Affairs intends to maintain and further develop
state owned fishing ports. The Government will
also implement important measures to improve
the safety and efficiency of shipping lanes.


-----

The Automatic Identification System (AIS)
provides the Norwegian Coastal Administration with information about maritime traffic.
This information serves as a good basis for
making risk assessments and evaluating
preventive maritime safety measures and
for determining required oil spill response
capacity.

The E6 highway is the backbone of the landbased transport system between the northern
and southern parts of Norway. Eliminating
bottlenecks will increase the competitiveness
of the business sector, improve safety on
stretches that have a high accident rate, and
facilitate travel along the E6 and on connecting roads. As investment projects and minor
measures are implemented, traffic safety will
improve and at the same time travel times will
be significantly reduces. Broadening narrow
parts, straightening out curves and improving gradients will make the transport system
more predictable and robust.

In order to improve connections between
Russia and areas further west and south in
Northern Norway, it is important to improve
the national road network in Finnmark and
Troms counties, both towards Russia and
towards Finland. The stretches between the
Norwegian-Russian border and Hammerfest
and Tromsø are particularly important.

In its follow-up to the High North Strategy,
the Ministry of Transport and Communications has considered the transport system in
the border areas towards Russia and crossborder infrastructure providing connections
to Sweden and Finland. In the spring of 2008,
a working group made up of participants


from regional authorities and road authorities in Norway and Russia presented a report
containing recommendations for measures
aimed at improving the transport system in
the border areas in the short and long term.
The Government attaches importance both
to the group’s recommendations and to the
counties’ priorities when considering measures to improve east–west transport corridors between Norway and its neighbours in
the east.

The Government intends to further improve
maritime safety in the High North. One of
the most important preventive measures has
been the introduction of the traffic separation
scheme approximately 30 nautical miles off
the coast between Vardø and Røst, which is
mandatory for all tankers and cargo vessels
with a gross tonnage exceeding 5000 tonnes.

Norwegian ports in the north should position
themselves and devise ways of cooperating
that will attract any increase in maritime activity in the north. The Ministry of Fisheries and
Coastal Affairs has therefore requested the
Norwegian Coastal Administration to coordinate cooperation between ports in Northern
Norway. Concrete cooperation projects with
Russian partners may be considered. These
could build further on existing cooperation
forums, the Russians’ development of the
Northern Sea Route and the experience
gained in connection with the Northern
Maritime Corridor project.

The Government intends to facilitate the
further development of Kirkenes Airport at
Høybuktmoen as an essential element in its
High North efforts. The airport and the town


-----

of Kirkenes could become a competitive and attractive gateway for the increasing activity that
is expected in northwestern Russia.

There is close cooperation in the field of
transport in the Barents region. Cooperation at
national level takes place in the Barents Euro
Arctic Transport Area (BEATA). The Working
Group on Communications under the Barents
Regional Council participates in this cooperation. The BEATA has been engaged in drawing
up a transport strategy for the region, for example by developing transport corridors to link
together two or more of the countries, thereby
creating a common transport market. This is a
demanding task, not least due to the differences between the countries as regards division
of responsibility, and the divergent business
interests within and between the countries.
Norway is also participating actively in the
establishment of a partnership in the field of
transport and logistics under the Northern
Dimension.

The Government has presented specific proposals
for transport infrastructure measures in Report
No. 16 (2008–2009) to the Storting: National
Transport Plan 2010–2019.

**5.3  Upgrading electric power infrastruc-**
**ture and security of supply**
An adequate transmission grid is essential for
business development in the High North and
for the development of wind power. New petroleum activity in the Barents Sea, other business
activity and the development of wind power
may create a need for a better power supply in
the region and an improved transmission grid.
Because distances are so great and there are
so few customers in the High North, infrastruc

ture development is time-consuming and costly.
It is therefore important to ensure close coordination between grid investments, electricity
production and consumption. The Government
will seek to facilitate appropriate development of
the transmission grid in the High North.

Increased production of renewable energy
will require improving the transmission grid.
Under the current rules, the authorities may
not instruct grid companies to increase capacity
even if production capacity is increased. The
Ministry of Petroleum and Energy has therefore proposed that the Energy Act should be
amended so that grid owners would be obliged
to connect new electricity producers to their
grids if an overall evaluation indicates that the
investments in production and upgrading of the
grid will effectively serve society at large. If the
amendments are adopted, the obligation to connect producers to the grid would result in closer
coordination between grid capacity, production
and consumption, and would thus trigger more
investments. This would be of great importance,
particularly for renewable energy production
such as wind and small-scale power plants.

As the transmission system operator, Statnett is
responsible for system coordination in Norway,
and therefore for the sound economic operation
and development of the Norwegian central grid.
Statnett also analyses needs and plans investments to meet future needs, including in Northern Norway. In Norway a licence is required for
any new transmission line. The Government is
seeking to make the process of dealing with licence applications more effective with a view to
ensuring the best possible coordination between
grid development, production and consumption.


-----

According to Statnett’s estimates, there is a
need for investments in the central grid in
Northern Norway totalling NOK 4.3 billion
over the next ten years. This figure includes
investments in the central grid by other actors.
Assuming that there will be new petroleum
activity in the Barents Sea, an increase in other
business activity and further development of
wind power, it has been estimated that investments in the transmission grid of NOK 9 billion
will be needed in the period leading up to 2025.
Statsnett’s plans include investments of just
under NOK 3 billion in new 420 kV transmission lines from Ofoten to Balsfjord, with an
extension to Hammerfest. This will provide capacity for an increase in consumption and new
production in Troms and western Finnmark.
Increased capacity will be essential for phase II
of the Snøhvit development. The production of
large amounts of wind power in Finnmark and
new processing plants for eastern Finnmark
will create a need for 420 kV transmission lines
from Skaidi to Varangerbotn and from Varangerbotn to Finland. Preliminary estimates put
these investments at NOK 1.4 billion. In the
event of a substantial power surplus in Northern Norway, it may be necessary to upgrade
the transmission lines leading south. Several
possibilities have been envisaged, for example
upgrading the transmission lines from Ofoten
to Rana and further south, which would require
investments estimated at NOK 3.6 billion. An
alternative would be to increase transmission
capacity between Norway and Sweden if the
grid in Sweden is also upgraded.

**5.4  Further developing space-related**
**infrastructure**
Space-related infrastructure is an important
management tool in the Government’s High


North policy and is an important component
of infrastructure in the broad sense. Navigation, environmental monitoring and exercise
of sovereignty are key themes where satellites play a significant role. The Government
intends to build space-related infrastructure
in the High North by participating in international programmes and national programmes
such as the one to establish AIS via satellite.

One problem in the High North is that current coverage by navigation systems is limited. The EU is in the process of building its
Galileo satellite navigation system. Together,
GPS and Galileo can offer better availability
and accuracy, and can help to increase reliability and safety in the High North. This will
be useful in connection with business activity,
shipping and air traffic, environmental safety
and the exercise of authority.

In the period 2011–2018, a number of advanced environmental and climate monitoring
satellites will be launched under the Global
Monitoring for Environment and Security
(GMES) programme. These will provide
extremely good coverage in the High North.
This will significantly increase capacity that
can be used to monitor climate change and
air, sea and land pollution in the north. The
system will also provide better ice forecasts,
thereby improving the safety of maritime navigation in Arctic areas. National authorities
and administrative bodies will be important
users of the system. Norway will participate
in GMES through European Space Agency
(ESA) programmes. With a view to building
expertise in these fields, the Ministry of Education and Research is planning to establish
new graduate and post-doctoral research fel

-----

lowships in relevant fields. The space-related
activities at Narvik University College, the
University of Tromsø and NAROM at Andøya
Rocket Range are all key elements in knowledge building in the north.

The Galileo satellite navigation system and
the Global Monitoring for Environment and
Security (GMES) programme are joint European projects based on cooperation between
the ESA and the EU.

**6. THE GOVERNMENT WILL CONTINUE**
**TO EXERCISE SOVEREIGNTY FIRMLY**
**AND STRENGTHEN CROSS-BORDER**
**COOPERATION IN THE NORTH**

Today the security policy situation in the north
is complex and marked by a broad range of
different risk factors. There is a growing
international focus on the High North due to
issues related to fisheries, energy, the environment and the melting of the polar ice. Dialogue
and constructive cooperation with the coastal
states in the north, particularly Russia, are an
important dimension of Norwegian foreign
policy in general and are vital for achieving the
best possible results in the High North. They
are also essential for ensuring that the High
North continues to be a stable, secure part of
Europe. The circumpolar nature of this cooperation is important in this context and must
be underscored. Like the other Arctic states,
Norway and Russia share a strong common
interest in stable and predictable development
in the region, marked by mutual understanding
and constructive cooperation. The Government
attaches great importance to this. The presence
and activity of the Norwegian armed forces in


the High North is a key part of the Government’s policy in the north and helps to maintain
stability and security in the region. Importance
is also attached to maintaining a visible military
presence that has the relevant capacity to exercise sovereignty, safeguard our sovereign rights
in our 200-mile zones, exercise authority, and
carry out surveillance, intelligence and crisis
management.

These priorities are primarily reflected in the
new Long-term Defence Plan, which was approved by the Storting in June last year, where
it was among other things decided to locate
Norwegian defence headquarters to Reitan,
near Bodø, move the Inspector General of the
Army to Bardufoss, and concentrate military
helicopter activities in Bardufoss. The phasein of Skjold Class MTBs is also important in a
High North context.

The Government’s aim is to improve border
control procedures and increase their efficiency,
and to continue the efforts to facilitate border
crossing between Norway and Russia, by building a new border control station at Storskog.

There is a long tradition of cultural cooperation
in a wide range of areas in the north. Closer
cultural contact promotes understanding and
communication and creates meeting places
and networks between different countries and
cultures. It enhances mutual confidence, insight
and respect across geographic boundaries and
often leads to cooperation in other areas.

Norway participates in a number of cooperation
forums linked to the Arctic Council, the Nordic
Council, the Barents Euro-Arctic Region, the
Baltic Sea Region and the Northern Dimension.


-----

An effort is now being made in a broader European context to make cultural cooperation in the
north a new priority in the Northern Dimension
Cultural Partnership. The challenges and opportunities in the region also apply to the cultural
dimension, and to the cross-border creativity
and communication that are now seeking new
forms of expression. This opens up for new
forms of cooperation in the fields of culture and
industry, tourism and cultural tourism in the
entire Barents region. Educational and research
cooperation in these fields can also provide
valuable input. There is cooperation in a wide
range of areas between institutions of higher
education and research in Northern Norway
and corresponding Russian institutions. This is
helping to promote people-to-people contact and
knowledge development.

**6.1 Increasing the activities of the**
**Coast Guard**
One of the Coast Guard’s most important tasks
is maintaining a presence in the sea areas in the
north. Importance is attached to maintaining a
regular presence, particularly in the Fisheries
Protection Zone around Svalbard. Through its
presence, the Coast Guard helps to carry out
surveillance and uphold our sovereign rights
in these waters, while at the same time exercising authority by monitoring fishery operations.
An adequate control regime is essential for
ensuring the sustainable use of the fisheries
resources in the north. The Coast Guard, with
the support of other branches of the armed
forces, plays a key role in enforcing existing
legislation in this area. The Coast Guard has,
in cooperation with the fisheries authorities,
helped to reduce illegal fishing in the Barents
Sea substantially. The Coast Guard also contributes considerable capacity to search and


rescue operations and assists other authorities
such as the police and the customs authorities
when necessary. The Coast Guard’s operating
budget has been increased since the Government took office, and in recent years many of
its vessels have been modernised. This has
increased the Coast Guard’s capacity to carry
out its primary tasks. The new vessels will
operate in the High North, which reflects the
high priority given to this region. The Coast
Guard’s operating capacity will be further
increased when new helicopters are phased in.

The Government intends to strength the Coast
Guard’s capacity to maintain a presence in the
sea areas in the north.

**6.2  Further developing border control**
The exercise of sovereignty and surveillances
are key elements of the Government’s High
North Strategy. Norway’s ability to exercise its
sovereignty clearly and predictably on land, at
sea and in the air is a fundamental prerequisite
for other activity in the north. This important
task has been assigned to the armed forces,
which are therefore intensifying their activities
in the north.

In our view, there is also a clear need to
strengthen border control at the Sør-Varanger
Garrison in Finnmark county. We cooperate
closely with the Russians on border surveillance today, and we must take our share of the
responsibility for ensuring that this surveillance is carried out in a satisfactory way. The
land border between Norway and Russia is
also part of the Schengen area’s external border in the north. Thus, by providing adequate
border surveillance, we are also fulfilling our
Schengen obligations. The Government’s


-----

aim is to improve border control and make it
more efficient. In this connection, it has been
proposed that the six border stations currently
in use should be replaced by two larger stations, each of which covers half of the border in
Sør-Varanger. It would involve building two new
border stations. This would make it possible to
concentrate expertise and reduce the amount of
paperwork. Such a solution would free officers
from administrative tasks so they could spend
more time on operative tasks. It would also
enhance the capability and capacity for carrying out risk assessments and analysing relevant
information.

**6.3  Further developing civilian border sur-**
**veillance and control**
In recent years, the civilian border surveillance
capacity for carrying out personal checks and
combating cross-border crime and illegal migration across the Norwegian-Russian land border
has been developed with a view both to preventing offences and to fulfilling Norway’s obligations under the Schengen acquis. Although the
civilian border control surveillance is headed by
the police, it is carried out with the assistance
of the armed forces/Garrison in Sør-Varanger,
in accordance with section 20 (4) of the Police Act, and the border commissioner at the
Norwegian-Russian border. Close cooperation
has been established between the Russian and
Finnish border authorities to combat crossborder crime. Not least thanks to this cooperation, there is very little cross-border crime in
the area. The Government’s aim is to maintain
security and stability at the Norwegian-Russian
border, and it recognises the need to further
develop civilian border surveillance capacity in
order to deal with any increase in crime or new
threats. As the border is part of the Schengen


external border, there will also be a need to adapt
to new requirements for cooperation on border
surveillance and border control, as is being done,
for example, through the new Schengen European Border Surveillance System (EUROSUR),
which is currently under consideration.

With a view to simplifying checks on persons at
the Storskog border station, efforts to upgrade
the passport control booths, etc., have been
started during the past year. Other improvements have also been made to comply with
recommendations made following the Schengen
evaluation of Norway that was concluded in 2007.
With a view to simplifying border procedures,
an arrangement involving a local border resident
ID card for people living on either side of the
Norwegian-Russian border is being developed.
A draft agreement on such an arrangement has
been submitted to the Russian authorities.
Such an ID card would be issued in place of
a visa, and could, for example, enable people to
commute on a daily basis between Sør-Varanger
and Pechanga.

The Government attaches great importance to
efforts to maintain the positive trend in peopleto-people cooperation and economic cooperation
with Russia. This is dependent on measures that
facilitate border control procedures, among other
things so that they do not put an undue strain on
those crossing the border lawfully.

Capacity at the present Storskog border station
is stretched to the limit. An increase in traffic volume would require considerable development of
the physical infrastructure of the border station.
The introduction of a border resident ID card
would also require widening the road through
the border control station to include additional


-----

lanes. An increase in goods transport could
also create problems for traffic flow through
the Storskog border station, which currently
lies right at the border, next to the Russian
border station Borisgleb. If a new border station is built, the possibility of moving it to an
area further back from the border should be
considered.

The building of a new border station should
be seen in connection with the construction of
the interstate highway between Hesseng and
Storskog under the National Transport Plan.
Planning and construction should be carried
out in close cooperation with the customs
authorities and other control bodies, with due
consideration to improving the infrastructure
at the border in accordance with the needs of
the transport sector and the border control
authorities.

**6.4 Strengthening competence-building**
**cooperation**
The Government will further develop Norway’s bilateral cooperation with Russian in the
High North. By means of concrete cooperation projects, we will build confidence and
strengthen our ties and economic cooperation
with Russia.

Our cooperation with Russia in the fisheries
sector, particularly as regards marine research
and monitoring the fish stocks and the marine environment in the Barents Sea, dates
back more than a century. The cooperation in
these fields was not, however, formalised until
1975. The Joint Norwegian-Russian Fisheries
Commission, which was established in 1976,
has been decisive for the management of fish
resources in the Barents Sea. This institution

alised cooperation must be continued and
further developed in the years ahead.

Through the programme for project cooperation with Russia, which is administered by
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Government has allocated NOK 130 million in 2009
for cooperation projects that promote crossborder network building. The programme
also contributes to giving practical substance
to the multilateral Barents Cooperation. The
funds for project cooperation with Russia
are used to support cooperation between
Norwegian and Russian institutions of higher
education in the Barents region. Funds are
also allocated for cooperation projects between Norwegian and Russian players in the
media and civil society. Priority is also given
to people-to-people cooperation in the Barents
region, with a particular focus on measures
for young people, cultural projects and cooperation between indigenous peoples.

The programme also supports environmental
cooperation with Russia. The purpose of this
cooperation is to obtain a scientific basis for
ecosystem-based management of fisheries
resources in the Barents Sea by conducting surveys of fish stocks and vulnerability
analyses and establishing research networks
and cooperation on environmental data. A
joint Norwegian-Russian report on the status
of the environment in the entire Barents Sea
is scheduled to be completed in the course
of 2009. It will form the basis for further cooperation on ecosystem-based management.
This work is being carried out in cooperation
with the Joint Norwegian-Russian Fisheries Commission. Efforts are being made to
establish climate change as a priority area in


-----

the bilateral environmental cooperation with
Russia.

In the field of higher education and research,
efforts are being made to intensify NorwegianRussian cooperation on enhancing knowledge
in the fields of petroleum and energy, sustainable use of resources, business development,
and the humanities and social sciences.

Close cooperation with our neighbouring countries is important for improving maritime safety
and oil spill preparedness in Norwegian waters.
Cooperation between Norway and Russia on
safety at sea in the Norwegian Sea and the
Barents Sea has been established on the basis
of an MoU of 2006. Cooperation on oil spill
preparedness has also been established. The
cooperation is being followed up by the Russian
Ministry of Transport and the Norwegian Ministry of Fisheries and Coastal Affairs through
a steering committee and working groups on
safety at sea and oil spill preparedness.

Norway’s cooperation with Russia in the field
of health and social services will continue to be
linked to the Barents Cooperation Programme
on Health and Related Social Issues and the
Northern Dimension Partnership in Public
Health and Social Well-being. Priority will be
given to efforts to prevent the spread of infectious diseases such as HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis.

The Government intends to continue allocating funds for Norwegian-Russian cooperation
projects in the time ahead. Kirkenes will continue to play a key role in the Barents Cooperation. The Government will advocate that the
Barents Secretariat and the Barents Institute


should be further expanded. The Barents Institute was formally established by the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs on 1 February 2006 as a followup to Report No. 30 (2004–2005) to the Storting
Opportunities and Challenges in the North. The
purpose of the Barents Institute is to conduct
research and studies and disseminate information concerning cross-border regional issues.
The Institute is located in Kirkenes. The Government intends to ensure that the Barents Institute is given permanent status. At the general
assembly in 2008, it was decided that the Barents
Institute should be placed under the University
of Tromsø.

**6.5  Developing cultural cooperation**
The Government intends to intensify cultural
cooperation with Russia as a key element of
its High North Strategy. The people-to-people
cooperation and the cultural dimension of the
strategy have contributed to closer cooperation
in the Barents region, and a number of measures
have led to closer contact and more frequent
exchanges between networks in Northern Norway and northwestern Russia. In January 2009,
the ministers of culture of both countries signed
an agreement on common efforts to promote
cross-border cultural cooperation. For the time
being, the cooperation is divided into three-year
action plans, the first of which will begin in 2010.
Initially, the aim is to establish a Norwegian-Russian cultural forum and arrange annual cultural
festivals in the region. At the same time, Russia
aims to establish a Russian counterpart to the
cultural grant programme BarentsKult, which
is the framework through which much of the
cultural cooperation in the High North is funded.
The agreement already includes a number of
specific priority areas: film, projects for children
and young people, and indigenous culture.


-----

Other equally important matters include the
mobility of artists, general access to culture,
intercultural dialogue and the cultural heritage and history of the peoples of the region.

The Norwegian-Russian action plan for cultural cooperation in the High North is based on
the strong cultural ties that have been forged
through history. The plan underscores the
importance of continuing to develop cultural
cooperation on the basis of local and regional
initiatives, and ensuring regional participation
and developing strong contacts in the north.
This will be reflected in the wording of the
first three-year plan. The Government intends
to develop a comprehensive plan for the
cultural dimension of its High North policy,
in cooperation with the newly established
cooperation forum for the three counties of
Northern Norway and with the Sami Parliament.

A broad range of cultural activities that also
involve people-to-people cooperation, sport
and indigenous peoples have long figured
prominently in the Barents region, and they
have become even more important in the
follow-up to the cultural dimension of the
Government’s High North policy. Cultural expression and cultural exchange foster greater
understanding and respect between different
cultures. The Government will seek to provide cultural meeting places and arenas that
give visibility to the cultures and traditions of
indigenous peoples and other peoples across
national borders. For example, it will support
the establishment of the Riddu Riððu Centre
for Northern Peoples. Norway participates in
a large number of cooperation forums linked
to the Nordic Council (such as the Northern


Dimension Cultural Partnership) and the
Barents Euro-Arctic Council, the Norwegian
Barents Secretariat and, as of 2009, a Norwegian-Russian agreement on cultural cooperation with an action plan focusing on the High
North is in place. In a European context,
efforts are being made within the Northern
Dimension to establish culture in the north as
a new cooperation area.

**7.  SAFEGUARDING THE CULTURES AND**
**LIVELIHOODS OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLES**

The peoples of the High North are bound
together by their livelihoods and dependence
on the natural environment. Indigenous peoples’ unique experience and knowledge give
this an extra dimension. Indigenous peoples
possess valuable knowledge about nature,
the climate, the environment and traditional
practices. They are stewards of cultural
values and languages, and have specialised
knowledge of ways of making a living under
marginal conditions in a subarctic area. This
knowledge must be preserved and further
developed in order to meet future challenges
related to ecological, economic, geopolitical
and other forms of social change.

The Government’s High North policy is
intended to safeguard the language, culture,
livelihoods and way of life of the indigenous
peoples in the region. The Government will
seek to provide conditions that enable the
indigenous peoples themselves, in a proactive manner and in accordance with their
own wishes and needs, to participate in the
processes and benefit from the opportunities offered by the future development of the
north. The measures are intended to promote


-----

capacity and competence building. The centres
of expertise at the Sami University College,
the University of Tromsø, Finnmark University
College and other relevant institutions should
be encouraged to cooperate more closely on
these issues.

**7.1  Documenting traditional Sami**
**knowledge**
Indigenous peoples’ traditional knowledge is
valuable and constitutes a unique ability to live
and work in the High North. To ensure that
this knowledge is integrated into efforts to
develop knowledge and utilised by the public
administration, the business sector and future
generations, the Government will initiate a
cross-border regional project to document
traditional Sami knowledge from a northern
perspective, modelled on the national programme at the Sami University College. The
purpose is to ensure that traditional knowledge
is an element in the process of further developing our knowledge and that it is integrated into
planning and management in the areas of land
use, natural resources and the environment in
the High North, and utilised in the monitoring
of the region.

**7.2  Establishing a programme for cultural**
**industries**
Conditions conducive to business development
must be provided in order to ensure that small
indigenous communities are able to cope with
global changes without having to relinquish
their own culture and livelihoods. This applies
particularly to indigenous communities in
Russia. The Government intends to establish a
business development programme for indigenous peoples based on their own culture,
under the auspices of the Barents Cooperation.


The purpose is to ensure further progress and
a more stable basis for social development in
the Barents region through business development, value creation and the development of new
cultural industries in the fields of tourism, business and trade, small-scale industry, Arctic food,
design, artefacts, etc.

**7.3  Developing ethical guidelines for**
**economic activities in the north**
Indigenous communities are vulnerable. Integrated resource management includes protection
of indigenous peoples’ livelihoods, traditional
knowledge and reindeer husbandry areas. Companies engaged in exploiting natural resources
in indigenous peoples’ areas are responsible
for meeting the high standards set for such
activities. The Government will initiate a crossborder circumpolar project to develop ethnical
guidelines for how different actors are to take
Indigenous peoples’ interests into consideration
when conducting economic activities in the High
North. The purpose is to ensure that indigenous
peoples’ rights are respected in the management and exploitation of natural resources and
the natural environment in the High North. The
project will be carried out under the auspices
of the Lule Sami centre Árran, the Sami University College and the University of Tromsø, in
cooperation with energy management experts at
Bodø University College. It will be necessary to
involve representatives of business and industry
and branch organisations in this work. For more
information on this subject, see Report No. 28
(2007–2008) to the Storting on Sami policy.

The Government presupposes that these ethical
guidelines will be developed in accordance with
the current state of the law, and that it will therefore not be necessary to establish new rights.


-----

**7.4  Developing digital infrastructure for**
**indigenous languages**
The indigenous languages in the High North
are threatened, and the use of modern technology to develop these languages poses a considerable challenge. The indigenous languages of
the High North are essential for transmitting
the unique knowledge of the Arctic way of life,
communities and livelihoods. These languages
must be documented, preserved and made
accessible for general use in order to prevent
them from dying out. The University of Tromsø
has built up expertise in the documentation
and preservation of minority languages, and
has developed modern technology for language
development. With a view to making these
languages accessible in an effective, userfriendly way, the Government will implement a
programme to develop digital infrastructure for
indigenous languages in the High North, with
a focus on minority languages in northwestern
Russia.

**7.5  Strengthening the capacity and**
**competence of Sami institutions**
In order to ensure satisfactory and equitable
development in the High North, the indigenous peoples must have the opportunity to
participate in political, social and economic
processes. They must be enabled to build up
their own capacity and competence so that they
can exert real influence and participate fully
in this process. This includes the opportunity
to participate actively in international and
cross-border regional cooperation. In order
to ensure their participation and engagement
in the development of the region, the Government will implement measures to facilitate
capacity and competence building, particularly
at institutions engaged in research and educa

tion on Sami issues and knowledge, business
and cultural development. The Government
will provide support for the establishment of
a centre for Sami research and competence
building on the Kola Peninsula in Russia.
The Government will initiate a study of Sami
knowledge development with a view to identifying the most important challenges facing
Sami higher education and research in a High
North perspective.

## COOPERATION IN THE HIGH NORTH

#### The Government plans to develop new knowledge, promote industrial growth, increase the level of employment, improve living conditions and conserve the environment, renewable resources and the multi-ethnic community of the High North. This will help to consolidate Norway’s international position as a responsible and significant actor in the High North.


**INTRODUCTION**
The awareness of Norway as Europe’s northernmost country characterises both the way we
perceive ourselves and the way others perceive
us. As a nation, we are associated with the sea and
with icy coasts, perilous expeditions, heroes of
polar exploration, winter sports, snow and ice. Of
course, Norway is much more than this, but the
elements that distinguish one from other people
often contribute most to forming one’s identity.

At the same time, this identity reveals something
about our merits and about what the outside
world expects of us. We have always been
involved in the High North, often in cooperation
across national borders.

Northern Norway occupies an important place
throughout the history of Norway. In the age of
migration, Hålogaland was already an organised
political entity with extensive international trade
links. One of our oldest reliable accounts of a
Norwegian concerns the voyage of the chieftain
Ohthere to Bjarmaland. The people of Hålogaland
and the Lade earls who were their descendants


played a prominent role during the unification
and christianisation of Norway, and several of
the important export products we know from the
earliest times came from the north of Norway.
For more than a thousand years, Northern
Norway has been the most densely populated
area so far north in the world.

While, in other parts of Norway, a multi-ethnic
community is a recent phenomenon, Northern
Norway has been multi-ethnic throughout its history. The indigenous dimension is an important
element of the High North policy. In the north,
people have had close contact with other ethnic
groups, such as Pomors and Karelians.

It is our responsibility to look after the opportunities of the High North for the benefit of those who
live there, but also for the country as a whole, and
in cooperation with other countries and peoples.
This must be done by means of targeted measures to secure our presence in the north, promote
activity and develop new knowledge. This is the
goal of the Government’s High North strategy.
By securing development in Northern Norway,

we can also safeguard Norway’s international
role as a significant actor in the High North, and
further develop this in a new era.

**INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION**

###### In international terms, the High North is in many ways synonymous with the Arctic, an area of the sea for which many countries show increasing interest. In order to regulate activities, protect traditions and distinctive characteristics, and ensure that developments take place for the benefit of all inhabitants of the High North, it is important that we cooperate well in international and regional organisations, as well as bilaterally with our neighbours and countries that border the Arctic.

**The High North**
No precise definition of “the High North” has
been provided in the Norwegian political debate.
The horizon is broader than Northern Norway
and Svalbard since Norway has major interests to
safeguard in a greater region. When the Government’s High North Strategy was developed
in 2006, the High North referred to the areas
surrounding the Barents Sea. This is really a
Norwegian perspective. With regard to closer
international cooperation, we must bear in mind
that the High North is gradually becoming more
synonymous with the Arctic.

We Norwegians must broaden our horizon if we
want to be involved in developing a sound policy
for the High North in the future.


**International interest**
The melting of ice in the Arctic is the key factor
driving an increased international interest in the
High North. Just a few years ago, no-one
envisaged how rapidly the ice in the Arctic
Ocean would recede, exposing open seas. The
Arctic is the first place where major consequences of man-made climate change are
visible. And these consequences enable the
prediction of increased human activity in the
Arctic in at least three areas:

First, the Arctic is a unique platform for
observing climate change and researching into
the causes and consequences, not only for the
Arctic, but for the whole earth. It will be necessary to intensify research activities.

Second, we will see a considerable increase in
ship traffic as the ice recedes. The volume of
cruise traffic is already rising, and it will not be
long before we see the first commercial voyages
with cargo vessels through the Arctic Ocean.
These completely new shipping lanes will almost
halve the distance between Western Europe and
Asia.

Third, the petroleum deposits in the High
North will become more accessible. Although
oil and gas activities in Arctic regions are very
demanding, part of the enormous petroleum
resources are expected to become more easily
accessible as technology improves and the polar
ice recedes.

These changes confront us with major challenges with regard to the monitoring of ship
traffic and the environment, search and rescue
capacity and oil spill preparedness.


-----

The states in the High North face a number of
common responsibilities. How are we to regulate
these activities, and what standards shall apply?
How are we to provide for sound living conditions
for the population, preserve traditions and distinctive characteristics and ensure that developments
take place for the benefit of all inhabitants of the
High North?

**The international order**
The Arctic - the area surrounding the North Pole is not a land area like the Antarctic, but an ocean.
The land areas that border this ocean are not a
no man’s land, but have a long history of human
activity. They are more or less inhabited, and are
undisputed parts of established states.

Cooperation via the United Nations and respect
for international law are cornerstones of Norwegian foreign policy, and it is within the framework of the United Nations and international law
that the legal framework for relations between
the states of the High North is established. The
United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea
of 1982 and provisions adopted pursuant to this
convention provide clear rules governing the
approaches to be adopted by states in resolving
unsettled territorial claims and in regulating fishing on the high seas. Only now are these provisions being followed up and brought into force,
since significant operations in the Arctic have not
previously been possible.

Of course, most of the practical cooperation on
current issues in the region takes place at levels
other than the global. Where appropriate and
desirable, two states can cooperate directly. An
example of this that deserves special mention is
the bilateral cooperation between Norway and
Russia on managing the fishery resources of the


operated a joint Fisheries Commission, which
meets annually to set the quotas for the various
fish species. It has been agreed that fishing vessels
have a right to fish domestic quotas in the other
party’s area of jurisdiction outside the 12-mile
limit provide that they respect the statutes and
regulations that apply to the area concerned. This
cooperation has developed from purely regulative
measures to encompass management strategies,
marine research and control issues. However,
issues that apply to several countries in the region
are best dealt with by multilateral organisations
where all of the affected countries participate.

**Regional cooperation organisations**
All countries with territory north of the Arctic
Circle (Norway, Denmark/Greenland, Finland,
Iceland, Sweden, Canada, the USA and Russia) are
members of the Arctic Council. This organisation
has been particularly engaged in research and
environmental studies. Studies to which the Arctic
Council has taken the initiative have been of major
importance for the conclusions of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). This
year, the UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen has
an important place on the agenda. At the Arctic
Council’s Ministerial Meeting in Tromsø in April
2009, Norway handed over the chairmanship to
Denmark.

The Barents cooperation was established in 1993
on the initiative of Norway. Participants include
the Nordic countries, Russia and the European
Commission. The Barents cooperation is not one
international organisation, but two, the Barents
Euro-Arctic Council (BEAC) and the Regional
Council. Each year, the foreign ministers meet in
the Barents Euro-Arctic Council. The Regional
Council gathers the chairmen of all of the counties
in the Barents region. Participants are Nordland,


-----

Troms and Finnmark in Norway, Norrbotten and
Västerbotten in Sweden, Lappland, Uleåborg and
Kajanaland in Finland, and Murmansk, Karelia,
Arkhangelsk, Nenets and Komi in Russia. This
way of organising a regional cooperation is totally
unique.

The Barents cooperation has helped to bring
together the people of the High North across
national borders. Many thousands of people
have participated in projects and events under
the auspices of the Barents cooperation. There
is cooperation in areas such as economics, trade,
energy, culture, education and research, indigenous peoples, youth, health, the environment,
rescue services, transport and communications
and tourism.

The Northern Dimension is a new body, and its
first Ministerial Meeting was held in October
2008. The concept “the Northern Dimension”


arose when Finland and Sweden joined the EU.
The cooperation that took place under this initiative has now formed the basis of an international
organisation where the EU, Russia, Norway
and Iceland are all members. This cooperation
is concentrated around health and the environment, transport and logistics. The Northern
Dimension may prove to be a valuable forum
since it covers the Baltic Sea region, the Barents
region and the Arctic.

Important roles are also played by other fora.
The Nordic cooperation plays a key role by
virtue of its neighbouring area policy and
information activities in neighbouring regions
and through its various support and funding
schemes. The EU makes a major contribution
through its extensive funding schemes and
through the support of European countries with
considerable resources. NATO is present and
must continue to be present in the High North,
where the main task of the organisation is to
help in maintaining stability and predictability
and to preserve the low level of tension that has
traditionally characterised the region.

**Arctic strategies**
Owing to the growing interest in the High North
and the Arctic shown by all affected states, more
countries and organisations have recently begun
to address the question of the requisite policy in
these areas. Some have developed policy documents, generally referred to as Arctic strategies.

The European Commission presented its strategy document in December 2008. This places
particular emphasis on three main objectives:
protecting and conserving the Arctic in agreement with those who live there, promoting
sustainable use of the resources of the Arctic

and helping to improve collective solutions for
administration of the area.

In January 2009, the US’s strategy was presented.
This notifies a closer US involvement in Arctic
issues, making use of the established cooperative
structures in the region. Canada too has ambitious plans for strengthening its presence in its
extensive northern areas, particularly regarding
research and the ability to operate in the Arctic
climate.

Approximately half of the coastline towards the
Arctic Ocean belongs to Russia, which considerably developed its presence and activities in its
northern areas between the wars and after World
War II. Russia has major, legitimate interests in the
High North, and is expected to present an Arctic
strategy in the near future.

**The Government’s High North Strategy**
The Government’s High North Strategy was
presented on 1 December 2006, and Norway was
thus early in developing such a strategy. The Government’s Expert Committee on the High North,
which was appointed in January the same year,
played an active part in the preparations.

Seven main priorities of the High North Policy
were defined by the strategy. These were:
1) good governance, 2) knowledge development,
3) sound management of the environment and resources, 4) facilitating development of petro-leum
activities, 5) safeguarding the livelihoods and cultures of indigenous peoples, 6) further developing
people-to-people cooperation, and 7) strengthening
cooperation with Russia.

An overall goal is general strengthening of the
economic base in this part of the country and


ment, safeguarding settlements and creating the
best possible living conditions for the people of the
High North. The strategy also defined 22 specific
action points for initiating follow-up of the main
priorities. To date, most of these action points have
either been implemented or started. A list of the
action points and the status as regards implementation is given at the back of this document.

The strategy makes no distinction between foreign
policy and domestic policy. Measures include both
intensification of the dialogue with other countries
and stressing of Norwegian views on High North
issues in international fora, as well as a number of
domestic measures in Norway. The idea behind
this is that the progress made at home and abroad
provides mutual reinforcement. Relations with Russia occupy a special place. Norway aims to develop
its cooperation with Russia on the basis that our
two countries have an objective common interest
in practical cooperation.

planes and phasing in of new naval vessels will
also strengthen our presence in the northern seas.

Strengthening of the Sør-Varanger Garrison in
Finnmark and the new border control station at
Storskog are important, and also provide for the
best possible border surveillance in accordance
with our Schengen obligations and the most effective border crossing for an increasing number of
persons.

**GOOD NEIGHBOURLY RELATIONS**
**WITH RUSSIA**

###### ���������������������������������������� developed closer neighbourly relations in the border areas. There is sound and broad cooperation within research and education and within trade and cultural exchange. Good neighbourly relations in many areas are also of fundamental importance for information exchange and for cooperation on resource management.

**Contact between people**
Norway and Russia are in the process of developing close neighbourly relations. Whereas, in 1990,
no more than a couple of thousand people passed
the border between our two countries, in 2007
the number was almost 109 000. Visiting NGOs,
choirs and school classes all have something to
learn from each other. Norwegian and Russian
researchers cooperate in fields from medicine to
marine biology and linguistics. Companies cooperate across the border, and invest in each others’
countries. The prospect of increased oil and gas
activities in the Barents Sea and the plans for new
mining activities in Sør-Varanger further increase
the importance of border crossing and labour
migration.

**Enforcement and presence**
A natural consequence of greater activity and
growing interest from many quarters is that
coastal states take a more proactive view of
issues concerning presence, the exercise of sovereignty, monitoring, intelligence and control.
The Norwegian Coast Guard plays a crucial role
in ensuring sustainable use of fishery resources.
Provision of sufficient resources has helped to
ensure the reduction of illegal fishing in recent
years, and the Coast Guard will continue to
focus on combating this.

The Norwegian defence establishment has
traditionally played a key role in our presence
in the High North, and this will be at least as
important in the years ahead. The long-term
plan for 2009–2012 for the Norwegian Armed
Forces contains important High North measures, such as establishment of a new Operational Command Headquarters at Reitan outside
Bodø, the movement of the Army Command to
Bardufoss and stationing of maritime helicopters
there, and the strengthening of the army in the
High North. Modernisation of maritime patrol


-----

The Government envisages a NorwegianRussian border that functions as a bridge for
cooperation between our two peoples. Norway
has done a great deal to improve the efficiency
of visa processing and to facilitate border crossing for Russian nationals. A “Pomor visa” has
been introduced, which provides inhabitants of
Murmansk and Arkhangelsk with the possibility
of obtaining a visa without having an invitation.
The processing time for visas at the Norwegian
consulate general in Murmansk has been reduced to five days, and structural improvements
have been made to the border control station at
Storskog in order to improve the efficiency of
border crossing.

On 1 December 2008, a new Norwegian-Russian
agreement on simpler visa processing entered
into force. The agreement reduces documentation requirements, sets limits for processing
time and fees, and makes it simpler to obtain a
multi-journey visa. The Government is continuing its efforts to make it easier for both skilled
and unskilled workers to cross the national
borders in the Barents region.

In June 2008, the foreign ministers of Russia and
Norway agreed to attempt to establish a border
resident ID card. The Schengen rules do not
permit the abolition of visas between countries
for all citizens, but allow for border resident
ID cards. Such ID cards allow visa-free border
crossing for permanent residents who live within
30 kilometres of the border. Negotiations with
Russia on this began in August 2008, and are
expected to take some time.

**Cooperative projects and exchange**
A number of ministries administer allocations
that are more or less earmarked for cooperative


Affairs’ allocation for 2009 is alone NOK 130
million (5 per cent more than the previous year)
and is mainly applied to cooperation in the Barents region. The Barents Secretariat in Kirkenes
administers almost 30 per cent of these funds.
Transfer of knowledge and exchange of experience are important elements of the supported
projects, and priority areas are people-to-people
cooperation, support of civil society, environmental protection, business development,
energy efficiency, health care and social welfare,
and research and higher education.

A good example of a knowledge and competence raising programme is the Presidential
Programme, responsibility for which in Norway
is shared by the Confederation of Norwegian
Enterprise and the Norwegian Association of
Local and Regional Authorities. Through this
programme, 30 young Russian managers are
invited each year to internships in Norwegian
companies and municipalities.

Considerable sums are allocated each year to
cooperation with Russia on nuclear safety, for

2009 approximately NOK 100 million. In 2005,
the programme “Barents 2020” was started;
the allocation for 2009 is NOK 35 million. The
money is used to provide grants in the form
of seed funds for initiating projects based on
knowledge and expertise on and for the High
North, and emphasis is placed on cooperation
with public and private partners.

**Cultural cooperation Norway – Russia**
During the period 2006–2008, NOK 25 million
was channelled through the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs for cultural cooperation measures in
Northern Norway. This was additional to the
support to the Barents Secretariat. For 2009,
this will be increased by a further NOK 25 million from the Ministry of Culture and Church
Affairs and NOK 15 million from the Ministry
of Foreign Affairs. The measures during 2006–
2008 were characterised by efforts to promote
meeting places and bring to the fore projects
that create favourable conditions for regional
involvement in the High North – and to view the
significance of the cultural sector in a broader
social context.

In cooperation with the municipalities of
Tromsø, Bodø and Sør-Varanger, the Ministry
of Foreign Affairs has held the festival Barents
Days, which focuses on cultural cooperation in
the Barents region and on research cooperation,
youth cooperation and cooperation on business
development. From 2008, Barents Days has
been made part of the culture festival Barents
Spektakel in order to strengthen the local roots
of the event and draw more attention to it.
Barents Spektakel is run by Pikene på Broen,
a company of art curators and producers based
in Kirkenes.


In January 2009 Norway’s and Russia’s Ministers of Culture signed an action plan for cultural
cooperation in the High North. The plan is to
lead up to the first Norwegian-Russian threeyear plan for cultural cooperation with a focus
on the High North (2010–2012). The plan is intended to ensure better coordination of cultural
investments at national and regional levels.

Barentskult was established in 2008 as a cultural
fund and to encourage Norwegian-Russian
cultural cooperation in the Barents region. The
fund is owned by the county authorities, but also
receives support from the Ministry of Culture
and Church Affairs and the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs. The Barents Secretariat has the practical responsibility in cooperation with the Sami
Parliament and the Sami organisations.

Established festivals in the region have also
been provided with funds for strengthening
their network building in north-western Russia.
From 2009, the festival Riddu Riddu has been
granted focal-point status. For the Ministry
of Foreign Affairs, it has also been important
and natural to encourage international contact
between Northern Norwegian culture with
areas outside the region. This is essential for
making the cultural sector even more robust. It
also underpins natural cross-border relations in
the High North, and helps to create cultural and
human understanding across important national
borders.

**CULTURAL EXCHANGE**

The Norwegian-Russian company of art curators
and producers Pikene på Broen builds bridges
across national borders by creating an interest
in culture and policy in the High North. The


-----

company is based in Kirkenes and has held the
culture festival Barents Spektakel since 2004.
The festival receives 5000 visitors each year,
and is the only cultural festival of its kind that
receives the support of the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs. The festival is intended to be a meeting place, where musicians, artists and actors
cooperate and create lasting ties across national
borders.

We live on a border that has changed enormously since our neighbouring country was
known as the Soviet Union. At that time, it was
practically impossible to have contact with
people on the other side. Border means many
things. One can talk of both physical and mental
borders, said Inger Blix Kvammen of Pikene
på Broen in an interview with the Norwegian
weekly newspaper Ny Tid.

The concerts at Barents Spektakel often combine artists from Norway and Russia or Finland,
so that the audience receive cultural impressions from at least two countries.

TransBorder Café, which is held as part of the
festival, is a concept involving presentations and
debates on the challenges and development of
the Barents region. There are contributions by
artists, researchers and politicians. In 2009, the
concept was also held in Nikel in Russia, where
Barents Spektakel held a satellite festival.

The exhibition Pan-Barentz is part of the Barents Art Triennial, arranged by Pikene på Broen
in cooperation with 0047 (Oslo), the University
of Lapland (Rovaniemi), Koncentrat (Kiruna)
and Anadolu Kultur (Istanbul). Here, the identity of the Barents region is explored by means
of a collage of approaches and interpretations


across national borders and disciplines. The
exhibition will travel from Oslo to Tromsø, and
during the next two years, will go on to Rovaniemi, Helsinki, Murmansk and Moscow.

–This year’s triennial is about the identity of the
Barents region. Fifteen years after the start of
the Barents cooperation, we ask whether there
is such a thing as a common Barents identity,
whether we can talk of Barents citizens or still
only Russians, Norwegians, etc. said Luba Kuzovnikova, the Art Director of Pikene på Broen
to the Tromsø newspaper Nordlys.

Eighteen artists and architects have been
invited to throw light on various issues concerning Barents identity at present and in the future.
They will also discuss the meaning of urbanism
in the High North.

## THE REGION OF OPPORTUNITY

### Knowledge, innovation and exploitation of the inherent advantages of the region are key elements of the Government’s plan for strengthening economic growth in the High North. We want to promote bridge building between research and industrial activities. Increased wealth creation is largely dependent on a well developed and well functioning infrastruc- ture. Better transport and communications in Northern Norway will make it easier to live and do business in the region and to visit it as a tourist.


**INTRODUCTION**
In addition to providing for petroleum activities, the Government targets support of
industrial activities in the High North. Knowledge development and innovation are of key
importance to exploiting the distinctive natural
resources of the High North. The Government
therefore wants to make provisions for those
who want to take advantage of business opportunities provided by research results. The
Government encourages the business sector to
look for profitable projects in research results,
and encourage researchers to discover the
commercial value of their research. Fruitful
cooperation between the research and business sectors will improve the competitiveness
of Norwegian companies, and contribute to
economic growth in the High North. In the
long term, this may create new industries.

The Government wishes to exploit the commercial potential of marine bioprospecting.
Here, the cooperation between research and
business development is all-important. Tourism
and entrepreneurship in Northern Norway are


also key elements of the Government’s focus
on the business sector in the High North.

Of course, there is already considerable
wealth creation in Northern Norway. However, travel distances are considerable, including the distances to the markets. Increased
wealth creation is therefore largely dependent
on well developed and well functioning infrastructure. The Government therefore gives
priority to targeted upgrading of infrastructure such as trunk roads, railways, airports,
shipping routes and fishing harbours.
Business development, particularly development of infrastructure, is long-term work that
requires thorough preparations.

-----

Prospecting for and research into marine
organisms with unique properties is called
marine bioprospecting. There are major
opportunities for developing commercial
products from research in this area. The
Government hopes that marine bioprospecting may become a significant growth industry
and an important part of a future knowledgebased economy both in the High North and in
the rest of Norway.

The road from discovery of a bioactive
substance to the mapping of properties and
further to industrial application may be long
and hard. In order to further this process,
the Government wishes to strengthen the cooperation between research institutions, the
business sector and the public sector, and to
create sound framework conditions to ensure
that the potential of the industry can be realised. For example, the marine biobank Marbank has received public support for gathering marine organisms from coastal and sea
areas of Northern Norway and Svalbard. The
initiative for the establishment of Marbank
was taken by the Institute of Marine Research
at the University of Tromsø, the Norwegian
Institute of Fisheries and Aquaculture and the
Norwegian Polar Institute, with the support of
the Ministry of Fisheries and Coastal Affairs,
among others.

An international conference on marine bioprospecting was held in Tromsø in February
2009.

**WEALTH CREATION**

##### ���������������������������������������� can be developed and sold. Innovation in areas such as exploitation of small molecules from marine organisms and experience of the great outdoors can provide good business opportunities.

**Marine bioprospecting: Molecules for sale**
Fish, oil and gas have made Norway’s sea areas
a major source of wealth. However, the genetic
material of marine animals, plants and bacteria
may also be of great value. This particularly
applies to small organisms that have developed
substances that tolerate temperatures close
to freezing point and withstand attacks by and
competition from other sea creatures. Some
of these substances consist of molecules with
unique properties. This can be exploited commercially and in a number of areas of research,
from medicines for cancer treatment to methods
for extracting a greater proportion of oil
deposits by pumping micro-organisms into the
wells on the seabed.


-----

– Why is marine bioprospecting important?
Substances developed by marine organisms to defend themselves against predators in the sea may in the future be used
to fight cancer cells in humans. In the
High North the sea contains molecules
with properties that may be of major
importance for production of medicines.


The Government launched Norway’s first
national strategy on marine bioprospecting
on September 8, 2009. Its vision is
“Marine bioprospecting – a source of new
and viable wealth creation”. Its purpose
is to better organize the utilization of our
ocean resources. The Government will
invest in national infrastructure and
research that stimulates a broad spectrum
of opportunities for wealth creation.

**Promoting innovation**
Knowledge development and innovation are key
to exploiting natural resources distinctive to the
High North. The Government therefore wishes
to make provisions for those who want to take
advantage of business opportunities provided
by research results. The Government encourages the business sector to look for profitable
projects in research results, and encourages
researchers to find the commercial value of
their own research. Fruitful cooperation
between the research and business sectors
will improve the competitiveness of Norwegian
companies and contribute to economic growth
in the High North. In the long term, this may
create completely new industries.


Educational institutions play a key role in bridge
building between the research and business
sectors. In cooperation with the University
of Gothenburg and Chalmer’s University of
Technology, the University of Tromsø has
established a two-year masters programme
in Arctic entrepreneurship. On the basis of a
Swedish model, teaching will be provided in
business development and entrepreneurship.
At the same time, the students will be given the
opportunity to start companies on the basis of
research or other viable concepts. The combination of classroom teaching and enterprise
development is intended to provide favourable
conditions for a culture of entrepreneurship
and innovation.

**Outdoor adventures for sale**
The tourism industry is in process of becoming
a key industry in Northern Norway, particularly
in what is referred to as ecotourism or geotourism. This is tourism based on nature, culture
and adventures, and is specially adapted to
conser-ving the environment and cultural heritage. Visitors enjoy the distinctive attractions

**TOURISM: THE KING OF KING CRABS**

Lars Petter Øie thrusts his head out through
a hole in the ice. Clad in a survival suit and
diving equipment, he is holding an enormous
king crab. He gives it to one of the guests on
the king crab safari, then hauls himself out of
the water and onto the ice. Øie’s Arctic safari
is part of a larger adventure holiday package
in Sør-Varanger municipality that includes
a stay in a snow hotel and a reindeer safari.

Øie is a tourism entrepreneur who has been
as far as the USA to promote his “Arctic
Adventure Resort” in cooperation with Innovation Norway and the Norwegian Embassy
in Washington. He has also been featured
in a combined food and travel programme
broadcast by the BBC. In Kirkenes, the great
outdoors is a magnet for tourists from all over
the world. North of the Arctic Circle, visitors
can stay at a hotel made of snow which is rebuilt every year, visit a reindeer park, admire
the Northern Lights and try their hand at sea
rafting, diving, kayak paddling or dog sledging. Perhaps the most exotic pastime is king
crab hunting.

– Crab claws are very powerful, so you must
be careful when you go diving for your dinner.
It is best to sneak up behind them and grab
them by their back legs, says Øie.

Guests who hold divers’ licences are allowed
to dive with Øie to catch their own crabs.
Those who don’t can enjoy the culinary
experience of king crab cooked in seawater
and served with avocado and garlic dressing,
bread, lemon juice and pepper.

of this part of Norway: watching killer whales
break the surface of the water, seeing reindeer
or going out onto the mountain plateau to view
the Northern Lights in all their glory. In 2008,
an adventure holiday in Sør-Varanger involving
a stay at a snow hotel, a reindeer safari and fishing for king crabs was voted one of the world’s
25 best new package tour concepts by National
Geographic Adventure Magazine. This is an
example of how visionary tour operators can
delight tourists by tailoring adventures and activities to take advantage of the unique outdoor
experience of the High North.



- What has the Government done?
The Government attaches importance to
the development of innovative tourism,
and to promotion of Northern Norway and
Svalbard as tourist destinations. In 2007,
the Government launched a national tourism strategy aimed at promoting Norway
as a destination for sustainable tourism,
and at developing the tourism industry to
support regional economy.


-----

– King crab meat is one of the best things
the sea has to offer. People come here from
all over the world to catch this delicacy with
their own hands, and enjoy it fresh from the
sea, says Øie.

A full-grown king crab can measure almost
six feet across, and weigh as much as 30
pounds. Since 1960, when researchers in the
Soviet Union introduced the species to the
Barents Sea close to the Norwegian border,
millions of king crab have migrated west.
Entrepreneurs such as Øie exploit the
opportunity to pick the crab right off the
ocean floor, and gladly offer this experience
to adventurous tourists.

**BETTER TRANSPORT AND MOBILITY**

##### Northern Norway is characterised by great distances, and markets are often far away. Wealth creation in the High North is dependent on a well developed and well functioning infrastructure including postal and telecommunica- tions services, roads, airports, railway connections and harbours. The Govern- ment’s transport plan for the coming years is one of the cornerstones of the High North policy.

**Important for the welfare of the inhabitants**
**and for business and industry**
In spring 2009, the Ministry of Transport and
Communications will present improvements
of roads, harbours, railways and airports for
the whole of Norway in connection with the
submission of the national transport plan for
the period 2010–2019. The plan’s measures
for Northern Norway must be viewed in


relation to the focus on the High North. The
Government proposes a further strengthening of transport and communications in the
High North. This publication was issued prior
to the publication of the national transport
plan, when details of these measures were
made public.

Safety, mobility, environmental protection
and efficiency are all key elements of the
Government’s transport and communications
policy for the High North. Efficient transport,
postal and telecommunications services are
crucial to the safeguarding of settlements and
a viable business sector. Effective and safe
means of travel and transport are essential to
people’s welfare, transport of goods such as
fish to the markets, tourism and the future
economic growth of the Barents region in
general.

Improved access to international markets
is dependent on strengthening of transport
connections between east and west in the
High North as well as good connections with

the south. The road network in the three
northernmost counties covers enormous
distances. It is over 1600 kilometres on the
E6 from Kirkenes to the county boundary
between Nord-Trøndelag and Nordland. The
distances and settlements along the coast
underline the importance of sea transport too.
Almost 50 per cent of the goods transported
from Tromsø to Finnmark go by sea. Positive
developments in the High North are also dependent on telecommunications and Internet
connections of satisfactory quality and capacity to carry large amounts of data, adapted
to new functions and services. Infrastructure
cannot be developed overnight. Arriving at
the right decisions is dependent on long-term
efforts demanding thorough surveys. The
national transport plan 2010–2019 is part
of this work.

**Simpler transport and communications**
**in the border areas**
As part of work on the national transport
plan 2010–2019, the Ministry of Transport
and Communications is reviewing a report
presented by a Norwegian-Russian working
group that has recommended measures to
improve transport and communications in
the border areas. The group was appointed
on the initiative of the Norwegian Minister
of Transport and Communications and the
Vice-Governor of the Murmansk region, and
represents state and regional authorities in
the Murmansk region and Northern Norway.

The working group recommends, among
other things, the planning of improvement of
the stretch of highway between Borisglebsk/
Storskog and Elvenes. The group recommends that the work be carried out from 2010


to 2013. Such an improvement would ensure
a good standard on the Norwegian side of the
border, compatible with the improvement of
the stretch of road from Murmansk to Borisglebsk, due to be completed in 2010.

The report also proposes an overall plan for
land management and physical infrastructure
in the Kirkenes area.

The report also takes up the need to improve
the trunk road network in Finnmark and
Troms in the direction of Russia and Finland.
Such an improvement will help to strengthen
the communications between Russia and
areas further west and south in Northern
Norway.

**Improving the road network**
The challenges regarding improvement of
the road network primarily concern improvement of narrow, winding stretches that are
difficult to use during the winter, or which are
subject to landslides. The E6 is the main land
transport route in Northern Norway. In the
coming years, the Government will invest in
improvements to the national road network,
i.e. the E6 and a number of national roads that
cross the borders with Sweden, Finland and
Russia. It is important to ensure good road
communications with neighbouring countries. In the 2009 budget for the Ministry of
Transport and Communications, funds have
been allocated to the planning of upgrading
of the E105 and roads in the Kirkenes area.
This planning will be carried out as part of the
Norwegian-Russian cooperation on infrastructure in the border areas.


-----

**Expansion of railway capacity**
The Government will expand the capacity of
the Nordlandsbanen and Ofotbanen railways.
It is aimed to develop the railway to carry
more of the goods transport to and from
Northern Norway. Movement of goods transport from the roads to the railways will result
in lower emissions of CO2, more efficient
transport and increased road safety.

There has long been considerable local and
regional interest in connecting the Russian
railway to Kirkenes harbour by means of an
extension of the railway line from Nikel to
Kirkenes. However, such a railway connection
would be very costly, and it is therefore a condition for building it that the Russian business
sector expresses a need for and an interest in
shipping a large volume of goods via Kirkenes
harbour. There are currently no indications
that the Russian business sector has such
a need or interest, since the Russians prefer
to use their own harbours. The Government
therefore views such a development as
somewhat improbable.

**Air transport is important**
Since 2006, more than NOK 1 billion has been
invested in upgrading safety measures and
extensions of facilities for the public at
Northern Norwegian airports (including
Svalbard). Northern Norway already has an
extensive air service network, with scheduled traffic at a total of 28 airports, including
Svalbard and the heliport at Værøy. Finnmark
alone has 11 airports, three medium-sized and
eight regional.

Ticket prices for domestic and international
flights from major airports have fallen sharply


in recent years. In order that passengers
on the short runway network in Northern
Norway shall benefit from this, the Government reduced ticket prices for flights on the
short runway network in Nord-Troms and
Finnmark by 20 per cent in April 2007.

**The increasing importance of harbours**
As a consequence of climate change, transport developments in the High North will
result in a longer sailing season, the possible
opening of new shipping routes and easier
access to northern harbours. In view of this,
the Ministry of Fisheries and Coastal
Affairs has requested the Norwegian National
Coastal Administration to coordinate cooperation between northern harbours in order
to develop possible solutions to common
challenges.

## WEALTH CREATION FROM OIL AND GAS

### ����������������������������������������������������������������������������������� – the sea north of the Norwegian mainland. Petroleum activities in the High North may in the long term have major positive, regional and national ripple effects. The Government will make provisions for petroleum-based employment and wealth creation in Northern Norway.


**INTRODUCTION**
If we move the map a little, we can place the
High North in the centre. The High North is
a kind of new centre, not just on the map, but
as a resource area. The fisheries of the High
North are among the richest in the world,
and must be managed so that they are there
for future generations. We now see that the
presence of oil and gas deposits also open up
the Barents Sea as a new European energy
province. Exploiting the opportunities of the
High North is one of the most important
components of the Government’s High North
Strategy. Responsible exploitation of these
resources will help to safeguard the welfare
of future generations.

In October 2007, Norway’s first cargo of
liquid natural gas was able to leave Melkøya.
The Government provides for exploration
activities, development and other oil and
gas activities in Northern Norway. Via the
Research Council, the Government channels
considerable funds to provide for this.


It is important for the Government that the
development of new oil and gas fields results
in increased productivity in Northern Norway
and in the rest of the country. Exploitation
of the petroleum resources of the High North
must support the positive developments in
the High North. Petroleum activities will be
a major driving force for new technologyintensive activities in Northern Norway. In
order to bring this about, an industry must be
built up in Northern Norway that can position
itself both nationally and internationally.

Through dialogue and mutual respect, solutions can be found enabling the different
users of the sea to live side by side in the
same waters, and, each in their own way
to contribute to exploitation of the natural
resources of the High North.

The High North is a new and very important
European energy province. In addition to
Norway, several other countries are now opening up prospects of exploiting the resources of
new areas of the sea. It is important to ensure
responsible exploitation of the resources of the
sea in the High North.

Exploration is the very precondition for making new finds, developments and activities. An
increasing number of companies wish to take
an active part in this. The Government’s High
North Strategy of 2006 states that the Government will “further develop petroleum activities
in the Barents Sea through an active allocation
policy in order to follow up results of exploration and the need for further exploration
acreage. The Government will also provide
for increased geological mapping of the High
North.” In order to follow up the High North
Strategy, NOK 410 million have so far been
allocated to geological mapping. In 2009, this
work will be complete. We will then have the
necessary knowledge base to consider opening new fields in this the area. Considerable
interest and optimism is currently attached to
petroleum activities in the South Barents Sea.
The Government’s focus on knowledge in the
High North is also part of this provision. More
than half of the Research Council’s High North
allocation, measured in terms of state research
funds, is applied to petroleum activities in the
High North.

**Positioning of North Norwegian industry**
The petroleum industry employs people
throughout Norway. However, there are fewer
specialised suppliers in the High North. The
Government wishes to increase the ripple effects of petroleum activities. Petroleum activi

**FACILITATING DEVELOPMENT**

##### The geological mapping of possible petroleum deposits in the High North �������������������������������������� ment will allow Northern Norwegian industry to position itself so that local and regional suppliers can benefit from developments.

The starting shot for establishment of petroleum activities in the South Barents Sea was
fired at the start of the development of the
Snøhvit field in 2002. The field, which became
operational in 2007, is important for several
reasons. It is the first gas development in the
Barents Sea and the first plant for liquid natural gas in Norway. Snøhvit will in many ways
be a driving force for developments in the
High North throughout the 30-year lifespan
that has been estimated for it. In the course of
time, Goliat and Nucula, as well as new future
finds will become operational. This will help to
ensure petroleum activity in the Barents Sea
for many years ahead.


-----

ties in other areas of Norway have shown that
it takes time to establish specialised suppliers.
However, it is clear that coordinated efforts
at several levels can help to amplify the ripple
effects of petroleum activities. Experience
shows that proximity to the activities results
in establishment of new industry.

In the work on ensuring direct ripple effects
of the oil and gas activities in the High North,
the Government will make provisions for
Northern Norwegian industry to position
itself. It is important that industry acquires
sufficient expertise and market networks to
be able to compete with the business sector in
other areas of Norway. Moreover, international
and national industry must establish departments that employ local manpower. This is
dependent on the existence of qualified local
manpower.

Analyses show the great importance of international exposure for business development
and employment in outlying regions. Actors
such as INTSOK and Innovation Norway make
active contributions to such internationali-sation, and will also do so for Northern Norway.
The Government also supports other supplier
networks and commercial associations in their
efforts to strengthen the capacity of Northern
Norwegian companies to prequalify for
complex tender processes.

INTSOK is a foundation that was established
in 1997 by the Norwegian government and
the Norwegian oil and gas industry to market
Norwegian oil and gas industry internationally.
This is done by means of various joint measures for member companies to increase their
penetration of international markets.


Innovation Norway provides services and
programmes that stimulate regional development, increase innovation in the business
sector and promote the Norwegian business
sector and Norway as a tourist destination.
Innovation Norway is primarily owned by
the Ministry of Trade and Industry, and also
receives funding from other ministries. The
organisation is represented in all Norwegian
counties and has offices in over thirty
countries.

**SNØHVIT AND GOLIAT:**
**POSITIVE RIPPLE EFFECTS**

The Snøhvit field became operational in
autumn 2007. This development is the first
milestone of the establishment of petroleum
activities in the South Barents Sea. Snøhvit is
the first gas development in the Barents Sea,
and the first plant for liqnified natural gas in
Norway. After a five-year-long construction
phase, the gas was at last able to stream from
the fields in August 2007. The first ships
loaded with liquid natural gas left Melkøya
in October 2007.

Snøhvit has resulted in considerable local
ripple effects. Hammerfest has experienced
a growth in employment, population and housing. At the peak, the construction activities
employed as many as 2500 persons. Operations, maintenance, modification and support
services for Snøhvit have created 400 permanent jobs, and have recruited three-quarters
of the workforce from Northern Norway.

There is now a shortage of manpower in the
region. StatoilHydro cooperated closely on
Snøhvit with local actors. The Snøhvit com

-----

mercial association, later known as Petro
Arctic, has played an important role in bringing this about. Analyses show that Snøhvit
has turned around a negative population and
employment development in Hammerfest.
New companies are setting up business in the
town. The municipal income is expected to
increase considerably. Extensive investments
have been made in the upgrading of school
buildings, infrastructure and development
of cultural facilities. The development has
resulted in competence building in the region, which has had positive effects on other
industries as well.

The development of Goliat may raise the level
of employment in the region too. Goliat is
expected to contribute to the technological
basis for further development of petroleum
activities in the region.


**OIL ENTREPRENEUR: AN OPPORTUNITY TO**
**RETURN HOME**

Astrid Tugwell has come home. After
graduating from upper secondary school,
Tugwell did the same as many other people
from Northern Norway: she moved south to
take higher education, and has since worked
outside Northern Norway, for Shell both in
Norway and abroad.
– Many of us who move south long to return
home. That’s why it is so important to create
jobs in the north, so that people can move
back, she says.

Today, Tugwell works for North Energy, an
oil company located in Alta. The company’s
mission statement is “with Northern
Norwegian ownership and expertise, North
Energy will provide alternative solutions for
profitable and sustainable oil activities in the
High North”.
– When it was decided that northern areas
would be opened up for oil activities, I decided
to help bring this about in a proper way. We
are a Northern Norwegian company, and this
is happening outside our front door, so we
want to be an oil company that does things in
its own way.

She points out that the company is owned by
Northern Norwegian industry, and that the
strategy is long-term.
– We will grow gradually, and want as far as
possible to recruit the necessary expertise
from Northern Norway. It is therefore important for us to market ourselves to education
institutions in Northern Norway. We are also
making an effort to make the industry see the
potential of establishment in the High North.

– We hope to be assigned operator responsibility in the Norwegian Sea and licence interests in the Barents Sea as early as the 20th
licensing round. This is important for being
able to take part in shaping developments in
the High North and achieving our ambition
to create alternative and sustainable solutions.
We have built up an organisation that is ready
to shoulder major responsibilities, and we are
impatient to get started.

Tugwell encourages people from Northern
Norway to see the opportunities of their own
region.
– I attach importance to recruiting Northern
Norwegian manpower, and have met many
people who are glad that there can now be
more jobs in the oil industry in the north.

## ENVIRONMENT, LIVELIHOODS AND FISHERIES

### Norway must lead the way in the environmental area, be an active partner for other countries and a long-term and trustworthy guardian of environmental and cultural values in the High North. The Government provides for wealth creation through sustainable use of marine and land resources, while safeguarding the functioning and productivity of the ecosystem.


**INTRODUCTION**
In the Arctic, we find some of the largest
areas on earth of virtually untouched nature.
Here there are hardy species only found at
the North Pole. Norway has a major responsibility, together with other polar nations, for
conserving these vast and vulnerable areas.

The High North has an important role to play
in maintaining biodiversity, and has increasing importance both as a destination for
outdoor adventure and as a reference area
for environmental monitoring and ecological
research. At the same time, major political,
academic and administrative challenges
must be solved in the years ahead. These
challenges are particularly associated with
climate change, long-range pollution, environmental toxins and increasing human activity.
The management plan for the Barents Sea
and the sea outside Lofoten is one of the
most important instruments for balancing the
regard for the environment with exploitation
of resources.


Climate change will acquire increasing, direct
significance for management of the environment and resources in the High North, since
the physical environment and the sustenance
base of plants and animals is very likely to
change considerably. Climate change will also
affect the transport and distribution in the
environment of toxins conveyed to the High
North by air and ocean currents. In the longer
term, an increasingly ice-free Arctic Ocean
may result in new routes for the international
shipping between east and west. This will also
give rise to increased environmental challenges and challenges with regard to emergency
preparedness and safety in the time ahead.

Norway has a direct responsibility for
stewardship of large areas of the Arctic.
A sound research-based knowledge base is
a prerequisite for Norway’s ability to manage
its polar territories in an environmentally
sound manner.

**NATURE CONSERVATION**

##### The Government attaches importance to ensuring sustainable exploitation of resources and responsible environ- mental management of the Barents Sea. Cooperation and the exchange of ��������������������������������������� states must be further developed in order to preserve vulnerable species and ensure responsible harvesting of natural resources.

**The Barents Sea – Lofoten**
In the area of sea between the Barents Sea
and Lofoten, there are sub-areas that are particularly rich in resources, while also being
environmentally vulnerable. Challenges are
associated with the effects of fisheries, ship
traffic and petroleum activities, and with environmental toxins, radioactivity and introduced
species. This particularly applies to the area
from Lofoten to Vesterålen, inshore areas,
Tromsøflaket, Eggakanten, the ice edge, the
polar front and the sea areas surrounding
Svalbard. These are areas that, on the basis
of scientific assessments, are of major importance for biodiversity and biological production, and where possible injurious effects may
have long-term or irreversible consequences.

**Comprehensive plan for the Barents Sea and**
**the sea outside Lofoten**
A comprehensive management plan for the
Barents Sea and the sea areas outside Lofoten
has been developed to protect the environment while providing for profitable industrial
activities. The management plan sets limits
for fishing, shipping and petroleum activities


in the High North in order to balance exploitation and protection.

An advisory group has been appointed to
follow up the plan, consisting of an expert
forum chaired by the Norwegian Polar
Institute, a monitoring group chaired by the
Institute of Marine Research and a risk group
chaired by the Norwegian National Coastal
Administration. Major programmes are being
implemented for survey of the seabed (MAREANO) and seabirds (SEAPOP). The plan is
due to be updated in 2010. The allocations to
comprehensive management of the marine
environment are being increased by NOK 3
million in 2009.

The Ministry of the Environment has entered
into a dialogue with the Russian authorities
in order to ensure a common understanding
of sound management of the Barents Sea.
Exchange of knowledge and information with
Russian institutions plays a key role in this.
The Russian Ministry of Natural Resources
will closely examine the Norwegian experience in order to strengthen the management
of its own sea areas, and thereby enable the
strengthening of the overall resource management in the Barents Sea.

**Polar bear conference in March 2009**
Norway invited “the polar bear countries”,
Denmark/Greenland, Canada, the USA and
Russia, to an international polar bear conference in Tromsø in March 2009. The meeting
was to be held under the Agreement on the
Conservation of Polar Bears that was signed
by the five countries in 1973. The reason
for convening the conference is the serious
threat to polar bears posed by melting Arctic


-----

sea ice and the need to cooperate more
closely on management of polar bear stocks
in the Arctic, particularly in a situation where
the species is expected to experience increasing problems as a consequence of climate
change coupled with increasing economic
activity in habitats.

The polar bear is a species that has considerable symbolic importance in a climatic and
environmental context. This conference
must therefore be viewed as a part of efforts
to create a better understanding of climate
change in the run-up to the climate meeting
in Copenhagen in December 2009.

**New white paper on Svalbard**
The Government submitted a new white
paper on Svalbard to the Storting in spring
2009. The white paper addressed major new
measures and approaches to conservation
of the wilderness in Svalbard. This applies
not least in relation to increasing traffic,
particularly associated with cruise tourism
in protected areas. Key measures announced
in the white paper include regulation of
tourism in the nature reserves in East
Svalbard and prohibition of the use of heavy
oil by ships with routes in the national parks.

Norway has included Svalbard on its tentative
list to the UNESCO World Heritage Convention. A nomination application can at the
earliest be considered by the UNESCO World
Heritage Committee in 2014. These approaches clearly express an active environmental
protection policy in keeping with Norway’s
ambitious environmental goals for Svalbard.


**The livelihoods of indigenous peoples**
The Barents region is a multinational cultural community including four nation states
and nine native ethnic groups: Norwegians,
Swedes, Finns, Russians, Sami, Komi,
Vepsians, Karelians and Nenets. Peoples
are bound together by their livelihoods and
dependence on the natural environment, and
indigenous peoples’ unique experience and
knowledge provides an additional dimension
to this. Indigenous peoples have valuable
knowledge of nature, climate, the environment and traditions. They safeguard cultural
values, languages and knowledge of industries
and ways of life subject to marginal conditions
in a sub-Arctic area. Indigenous peoples’ communities in the High North differ with regard
to vulnerability and sustainability in meeting
future challenges associated with ecological,
economic, political and social changes. The
traditional ways of life of indigenous peoples
are dependent on sustainable management
of natural resources.

##### tant to extend cooperation with other countries on management of fish stocks while developing systems for monitoring shipping, emergency preparedness, and search and rescue services.

**Cooperation on combating overfishing**
Our northern sea areas are among the richest
in the world as regards fishery resources,
and it is our responsibility to safeguard these
for future generations. Climate change may
lead to alteration of growth conditions for and
changes in the distribution of fish. In addition
to this, new areas in the Arctic Ocean may be
opened up for fishing as the ice melts. A longterm and sustainable management must be
scientifically based and be secured by strict
enforcement. This requires close cooperation
between the states.

Norwegian and Russian research institutions
have collaborated for fifty years on surveying
the marine environment and fish in the sea.
The researchers decide what exploratory
voyages shall be carried out, and exchange
research results. On this basis, following
consultation with the International Council
for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES), they
recommend how much fish can be harvested.
This work is of key importance for a sound
long-term management of the fish stocks. The
joint Norwegian-Russian Fisheries Commission sets the total annual quotas for shared
stocks on the basis of the recommendations,
and has also developed separate management
rules for the most important stocks.

In world terms, illegal, unreported and
unregulated fishing constitutes the biggest
threat to sustainable fishery management. In

Reindeer stocks in some parts of Finnmark are
currently too large in relation to the natural
resource base, which in the long term may
threaten the basis for sustainable reindeer
husbandry. The new Reindeer Husbandry Act,
which entered into force on 1 July 2007, is an
important contribution to efforts to ensure sustainable reindeer husbandry in Finnmark and
other parts of Norway. The Act assigns greater
responsibility to the reindeer husbandry industry and gives the industry increased influence
over its own development. In addition to this,
a new Convention on Reindeer Pasture has
been negotiated between Norway and Sweden.
The Convention is expected to enter into force
in 2010.

**SUSTAINABLE FISHING AND SAFETY AT SEA**

##### The Government has implemented exten- sive measures to combat illegal fishing in order to ensure that fish remain a renew- able resource. Ice melting in the Arctic will open up new sea areas for fishing and transport. It is therefore impor

the Barents Sea, cod in particular has been subjected to extensive illegal fishing. As much as
100 000 tonnes were fished illegally each year
up to 2005. This is equivalent to one-quarter
of the legal quota. Such overfishing is a threat
to the whole marine ecosystem, the fishery
industry and coastal communities.

The Government has adopted various measures to combat illegal fishing: cooperation on
monitoring, exchange of catch data, cooperation on control of fishing boats and records in
connection with the landing of fish and blacklisting of vessels. This cooperation is carried
out not only with Russia and other countries
with zones bordering on those of Norway,
but also in international organisations such as
the Northeast Atlantic Fisheries Commission
(NEAFC). As a result of this, illegal fishing
in the Barents Sea fell from 100 000 tonnes in
2005 to approximately 40 000 tonnes in 2007.
This was the basis for the ability of Norway
and Russia to agree on a cod quota for 2009
that was 95 000 tonnes higher than that of the
previous year.

The efforts to combat illegal fishing in the
Barents Sea are a long-term process. Both Russian and Norwegian fishery authorities wish
to strengthen the institutions that have been
developed for management cooperation. A satisfactory control regime is crucial to ensuring
sustainable exploitation of fishery resources in
the High North. The Norwegian Coast Guard
and other parts of the defence establishment
play a key role in monitoring fishery activity and in enforcing current regulations. The
Ministry of Fisheries and Coastal Affairs and
the Directorate of Fisheries give priority to the
work on confidence-building measures, infor

mation work and development of resource
control for combating illegal fishing. The
Norwegian and the Russian Auditors General
conduct parallel audits of fishery management
in the Barents Sea.

**Strengthening of safety at sea**
Ice melting in the Arctic opens up new sea
areas for fishing and transport. The sailing
distance between Europe and Asia will be
greatly reduced by the opening of new passages through the Arctic Ocean. The increase
in ship traffic in the High North will place
new demands on monitoring systems, rescue
capacity, marine safety and oil spill preparedness, not least because the Arctic environment is particularly vulnerable to oil spill
resulting from shipping accidents in open sea.

As a polar nation, Norway must take responsibility for increased safety and emergency
preparedness needs in newly accessible sea
areas. New civil monitoring systems must be
developed to enable monitoring of ship traffic
at all times, as well as coordinated
arrangements for emergency preparedness
and rescue. Such systems must be developed
and operated in cooperation with Iceland, the
USA, Canada and Russia. The Government
has given support to the pilot project “BarentsWatch” under the auspices of SINTEF, which
provides a basis for further cooperation and
establishment of a comprehensive monitoring and warning system for the northern sea
areas. Support has also been given to the Det
Norske Veritas project for coordinating industrial standards for environment, health and
safety measures in the petroleum industry in
the Barents Sea.

preparedness for acute oil pollution. An initiative was also taken to increase the activity
in the Norwegian-Russian border region in
connection with the Vardø VTS Centre (the
Vardø initiative). This resulted in more training in oil spill response and marine safety,
as well as courses in transport development,
harbour cooperation and logistics challenges
in Vardø and Murmansk.

In response to increasing traffic in Svalbard,
the Ministry of Fisheries and Coastal
Affairs has found it necessary to establish an
improved framework to provide for the ship
traffic around the archipelago. Enforcement
of the Harbour Act in Svalbard from 1 May
2008 will strengthen marine safety in the
archipelago and improve the possibility
of organising harbour operations.

**BIRD LIFE: BAD TIMES FOR NORWEGIAN**
**SEABIRDS**

A number of seabird species in northern
and central Norway are struggling with food
shortage and nest desertion. Along the coast,
bird colonies are threatened with extermination, and the situation is viewed as alarming.

The guillemot population has declined over
the last 40 years owing to a combination of
malnutrition, bycatch in fishing gear, oil pollution and harvesting. The force of these factors
varies from year to year.

– In the case of kittiwakes and Brünnich’s
guillemots, we know little about the causes.
The direct cause where kittiwakes are concerned, is food shortage with resulting death
of young birds, but the underlying cause

A number of measures have already been
implemented to strengthen marine safety in the
northern sea areas. In 2007, the Vessel Traffic
Service Centre (VTS) for Northern Norway
opened in Vardø, with responsibility for monitoring and guiding ship traffic along the coast
of Northern Norway.

In 2007, shipping lanes outside were established outside Norwegian territorial waters
on the distance from Vardø to Røst. This will
reduce the risk of accidents since traffic is
kept apart and is monitored by the VTS in
Vardø. Should an accident nevertheless occur,
environmental consequences would be reduced
because ship traffic would be moved further
out from the coast, which facilitates the implementation of measures. The Government aims
to increase the state tugboat preparedness in
Northern Norway in 2010 to three tugboats for
continuous operation throughout the year.

In 2006, Norway and Russia signed a memorandum of understanding on strengthening of
cooperation in marine safety and emergency

is uncertain. In the North Sea and parts of
the Norwegian Sea, the cause is probably a
regime shift in the sea, where the entry of
warmer water bodies alters basic conditions
in the food chain, resulting in the total or
partial eradication of the animals that seabirds feed on. This type of change is often
combined with overfishing or other manmade factors, explains Hallvard Strøm of the
Norwegian Polar Institute.

– During the current period of unpredictable
and complex climatic conditions, it is more
important than ever to take control of other
man-made factors that negatively affect seabirds. These include overfishing, resulting in
reduced food access for seabirds, bycatch of
birds in fishing gear, oil pollution, disturbance
of important habitats and alien species, such
as mink, that threaten nesting seabirds, he
says.

Researchers are actively engaged in monitoring and mapping the bird life of the
Barents Sea in order to obtain the necessary
knowledge to improve the management of
these marine environments. Through the
seabird programme SEAPOP, which was
started in 2005, researchers will, for the first
time, map the distribution of nesting, moulting, resting and overwintering seabirds in
numbers time and space from Skagerrak in
the south to Svalbard in the north.

– Such detailed and extensive monitoring
is intended to provide a basis for further
research to determine the causes of the
changes and predict future changes, says
Strøm.


The purpose of the programme is to provide
sound basic data that is needed when considering measures that may be employed
in reversing current trends. It is staffed by
researchers from the Norwegian Institute for
Nature Research (NINA), Tromsø Museum
and the Norwegian Polar Institute. The
programme is funded by the Ministry of the
Environment, the Ministry of Petroleum and
Energy and the Norwegian Oil Industry
Association (OLF).

The Government is investing more in High North-relevant research and in strengthening universities and university colleges in Northern Norway. A key �������������������������������������������������������������������������������������� understanding of global climate change. Through efforts in relation to Svalbard and our membership of the Arctic Council, Norway makes an important contribution to understanding global climate change.


**INTRODUCTION**
Research and education play a part in all
areas of society and provide the basis for
future stable employment. In a vast region
with a scattered and often rather small
population, a shortage of qualified manpower may limit economic development, and
simultaneous development of multiple strong
knowledge communities poses a considerable
challenge. The knowledge sector is therefore
a key sector in the High North policy.

Priority must be given to development of networks between various centres of expertise
and to a close collaboration between research
and the business sector and between the public and private sectors. International cooperation on research and education, and exchange
of students and teachers help to strengthen
communities in the High North.

Much of the regions’ economic potential is
not only unexploited, it is also uncharted.
The key industries of the future will be knowledge-based, and without new knowledge


the problems will not be solved. Strengthened
knowledge is also essential to sound, sustainable exploitation of natural resources, and to
conservation of a vulnerable environment.

**KNOWLEDGE TO ACT**

##### General increases are being made in funds for research in the High North, but the Government also attaches im- portance to allocations in promising new areas, such as marine bioprospecting. ����������������������������������������� regional funds, universities and other education institutions are being strength- ened and a new centre for ice and climate will increase our understanding of political, environmental and social �����������������������������������

These are areas where increased knowledge
makes society better able to exploit opportunities and meet challenges. Climate, indigenous peoples and business development are
given priority in all areas. In addition to these
priority areas, the Research Council wishes to
exploit the unique opportunities of research
in the High North. Many of the opportunities and challenges in the High North cross
national borders. Particular importance is
therefore attached to internationalisation.

More than half of the funds made available in
the Research Council’s High North allocation
are currently applied to petroleum activities
in the High North, there is also considerable
and increasing activity within the environment, marine resources and research areas
unique to the High North. In the fiscal budget
for 2008, the funds allocated to environmental
research and bioprospecting were increased.

Bioprospecting involves searching for useful
genes and substances in fish, algae and other
living organisms. Some substances may have
medicinal applications, others may perhaps
be used in chemical industry. Research in
bioprospecting is an example of the coherence of the High North policy: funds from the
Research Council provide for wealth creation
in the High North.

There has been considerable research activity
in the priority areas of the Research Council’s
High North allocation right from the start. In
2006, the Research Council allocated NOK
440 million to High North-relevant research.
In 2007, the amount was increased by NOK
176 million, an increase of 40 per cent. NOK
72 million of this is being applied to an in

the Research Council of Norway submitted a
strategic plan for an intensification of research in the High North and a strengthening
of centres of expertise in Northern Norway.
The aim of the plan is to raise research competence, enhance competence in the private
sector, strengthen existing networks and
forms of collaboration and develop new ones,
develop and strengthen educational opportunities and increase the attractiveness of education and research institutions. In 2009, the
Government will increase its efforts to adapt
the North Norwegian education and research
system to the needs of business and industry.
2009 also saw the establishment of a regional
research fund which will primarily finance
regional research that promotes innovation
and business development.

Since June 2006, the Research Council has
given priority to five areas in its High North
Strategy: oil and gas, the environment and
fisheries, innovation and business development, residence in the High North and
foreign policy in the High North.

creased emphasis on High North research by
the Research Council. However, much of this
growth is due to the International Polar Year.

**The world’s largest research cooperation**
The International Polar Year is the world’s
largest polar research programme ever, with
the participation of 50 000 researchers from
63 countries. Norway’s allocation of a total
of NOK 330 million over four years makes
it one of the largest contributors. The Polar
Year involves intensive data collection during
two summer seasons in the north and two in
the south, during the period from 1 March
2007 to 1 March 2009. The purpose of the
International Polar Year is to exploit the great
potential of the polar areas for throwing light
on enduring scientific problems, particularly
in climate research.

Perhaps the largest Polar Year project,
“Integrated Arctic Ocean Observing System”
(iAOOS), involves making for the first time
detailed measurements of the entire Arctic
Ocean. Another major international project is
“Contaminants in Polar Regions” (COPOL),
the purpose of which is to study and compare
absorption and transport of environmental
toxins in food chains in different oceans.

As a result of the International Polar Year
there has been an increase in research activity in Svalbard. A number of projects, both
Norwegian and foreign, take place wholly or
partly in the archipelago. Under the auspices
of the International Polar Year, altogether 36
internationally financed projects and 16 funded by Norway are associated with Svalbard.

**Centre for Ice, Climate & Ecosystems (ICE)**
Norway is in the process of establishing a
Centre for Ice, Climate & Ecosystems (ICE)
at the Norwegian Polar Institute in Tromsø.
The centre is planned to strengthen Norway’s
position as an active and visible contributor to
international climate research. The goal is to
build up a world-class specialist community in
the area of ice and climate during the course
of five years.

Norway already has well developed specialist
communities with climatic and polar expertise and glaciology. We also have up-to-date
infrastructure for research and environmental
monitoring in both the Arctic and the Antarctic. It is this technical expertise that is to be
strengthened, focused and further developed
in cooperation with other national institutions.
The centre will contribute to a major increase
in knowledge concerning issues associated
with ice melting. In countries of major importance for progress in the international work
on climate-related issues, it is also intended to
raise awareness of the importance of limiting
emissions of greenhouse gases. The centre
will collaborate with the world’s “glacier
states” on increasing understanding and
knowledge concerning the political, environmental and social consequences of snow and
ice melting and of thawing permafrost.

**Strengthening of education institutions**
The University and university college system
in the High North is well developed, and
these institutions play a key role in competence building in the High North. The
seven Northern Norwegian institutions, the
University of Tromsø, the Sami University
College and the university colleges in Bodø,
Finnmark, Harstad, Narvik and Nesna are
important knowledge actors in the region.

In January 2009, the University of Tromsø
and Tromsø University College merged. The
new institution will be a national and international power centre for expertise, growth and
innovation in the High North. In 2009, the
Sami Science Centre opened. This will house
the Sami University College and the Nordic
Sami Institute, and will be a Sami Knowledge
Centre. The institutions cooperate closely
with each other and with other regional and
international actors. An important international instrument is the Arctic University,
an international cooperative forum for
education institutions in the High North.

**CLIMATE RESEARCH: THE KEY ROLE**
**OF THE ARCTIC**

##### ���������������������������������������� in work on understanding how climate change will affect us. Svalbard’s geo- graphical location, good infrastructure and accessibility makes the archipelago a key area for obtaining such know- ledge and for efforts to adapt society to climate change.

In order to understand global climate change,
we must understand the Arctic. The Arctic
plays a key role in global climate change.
The warming of the Arctic is twice as rapid
as the global average. This is a forewarning
of global changes and, through reciprocal action, changes in the Arctic may contribute to
changes further south.

There are still considerable gaps in our
knowledge concerning global climate change
and the role of the Arctic. Research in this
area is therefore of major importance.

The shining white polar ice over the Cap of
the North reflects considerable solar energy
back into space. However, the polar ice is
diminishing year by year. This exposes open
seas which absorb much more heat from the
sun. This is expected to further reinforce
the warming, melting more ice and exposing
more sea, and thus accelerating the warming
process.

Another important question is how much
and how rapidly the enormous Greenland Ice
Sheet is melting or sliding into the sea. This
melting is decisive for how much and how


rapidly the world’s oceans will rise during the
coming decades. This is potentially a major
problem. Such questions have increased international researchers’ interest in the Arctic,
and Svalbard is now an international arena for
polar research.

**Svalbard – unique access to the Arctic**
Svalbard plays a major role in international climate research. Its geographical location, good
infrastructure and accessibility make the archipelago a key area for acquiring knowledge
about what happens when the temperature
rises in the Arctic. Such knowledge is of great
value both for the work on reducing global
emissions of greenhouse gases and for work
on adapting society to the climate change that
now seems unavoidable.

Foreign research activity in the archipelago
has increased considerably in recent decades. There are now 11 permanent research
stations in Svalbard, and researchers from
approximately 20 countries visit the archipelago each year to work on their research
projects. Important infrastructure established
since 2000 in Ny-Ålesund includes a South
Korean research station (2002), The marine
laboratory (Kings Bay AS, 2005), China’s station (2004), India’s station (2008) and Climate
Change Tower (Italy, 2008).

Recent decades have seen a considerable
increase in research and education, and
these activities now constitute a major part of
the Norwegian activities in the archipelago.
In Longyearbyen, a new station for auroral
research (the Kjell Henriksen Observatory)
was opened in 2008. The station houses
researchers from Norway and a number of

Government will use the Svalbard Global
Seed Vault to provide increased understanding and awareness of biodiversity, genetic resources and food security in the time ahead.
The Ministry of Agriculture and Food has
allocated a total budget of NOK 4.3 million for
2009 for operation of the Seed Vault, information activities and management.

**Space activities in Svalbard**
Earth observation from satellites in space
provides important information on how ecological processes and human activity change
the environment on earth. Monitoring by
satellite also facilitates prevention and followup of environmental crime at sea, and helps to
enable more rapid response to accidents.

Svalbard is an optimal location for communication with satellites, particularly in polar
orbits. As a result of this, Svalbard Satellite
Station (SvalSat) has become the largest
in the world for retrieving data from polar
satellites. The station is also world-leading in
retrieving data from polar weather satellites.

A Norwegian civilian monitoring satellite is
under construction. This satellite will monitor
ship traffic in large areas of the High North,
and the information it provides will be of
major help for maritime navigation and for
the exercise of Norwegian sovereignty in all
Norwegian sea areas north of Stad.

**Dangerous melting needs to be understood**
1.3 billion people are currently in danger
of increasing water shortage as a result of
reduced flow in vital rivers. This serious effect of climate change is due to the melting

foreign research institutions. Norway is still
the country with most research activity in
Svalbard.

Norway also operates an education institution in Svalbard. The University Centre in
Svalbard (UNIS) is the world’s northernmost
higher education institution. UNIS provides
unique range of courses in unique surroundings to 350 students from 26 countries. UNIS
is owned by the Ministry of Education and
Research, and cooperates closely with the
Universities of Tromsø, Trondheim, Bergen
and Oslo.

**THE SVALBARD GLOBAL SEED VAULT**
**SAFEGUARDS THE WORLD’S SEEDS**

The Government has established a global
security storage vault for seeds in Svalbard,
which was opened in February 2008. The
world has several more seed collections, but
their valuable contents could be lost in natural
disasters or as a result of political instability. The Svalbard Seed Vault however is well

of high-lying glaciers and snow that supply
the rivers with water during periods of low
precipitation.

The Himalayas are the “water tower” that
supplies water to seven of the largest rivers in
Asia. This mountain range is already severely
affected by climate change, and approximately 70 per cent of the glaciers in the area
are in rapid decline. The rivers that drain the
mountain masses of Central Asia affect the
sustenance base for altogether 40 per cent of
the world’s population. In addition to reduced
flow, an increase in flood episodes is anticipated. Both of these changes result in reduced
food production and negative economic ripple
effects.

In addition to the Himalayas, mountain ranges
such as the Andes, the Rocky Mountains and
the Alps are in danger. These ranges are of
major importance for the flow of rivers in
periods of low precipitation.

Norway has considerable expertise in the
area of snow, ice and glaciers, which will be
further reinforced by the building of the new
Centre for Ice, Climate & Ecosystems (ICE).
The Minister of the Environment has therefore, in collaboration with the United Nations
Environmental Programme (UNEP), taken
the initiative to hold a research conference in
2009 on melting of snow and ice from high-lying glaciers. The conference will be hosted by
the Norwegian Polar Institute. The aim of the
conference is to disseminate knowledge and
create a basis for raising these issues higher
on the agenda of international climate work.


**NORWEGIAN CLIMATE RESEARCH:**
**WARMER IN THE ARCTIC OCEAN**

Norwegian measurements show that parts of
the East Greenland current in Framstredet
have become between two and three degrees
warmer just during the last ten years. This
area of the sea between Greenland and Svalbard is over 2500 metres deep, and measurements made here take the pulse of the sea in
the far north of the world. The observations
from Framstredet in 2007 and 2008 show that
the larger proportion of the ice is now firstyear ice, and that there is little multi-year ice.
Previously, most of the ice was thick multiyear ice.

Here we can study how the ecosystems in the
Arctic are affected by climate change. Warm
Atlantic water flows northwards into the Arctic Ocean. The flow then follows the continental shelf eastwards, while the water is cooled
down and becomes heavier. After several
years of cooling and change of salt content,
this water becomes the main flow out of the

measured over a distance of more than 1500
kilometres. Corresponding aerial measurements were made north of Alaska, Canada
and Siberia.

Together, these measurements by researchers from many countries give a more accurate
picture of the effects of climate change on the
Arctic. This information will in its turn give
a more accurate picture of the effects of the
changes in the Arctic on the global climate
system.

Arctic Ocean. Over 90 per cent of all the ice
drift out of the Arctic Ocean goes via Framstredet. These observations have been made
as part of the international research project
“Integrated Arctic Ocean Observing System”
(iAOOS), which is perhaps the largest project
under the auspices of the International Polar
Year. Through the project, detailed measurements have, for the first time, been made
throughout the Arctic Ocean. Norway has
contributed to the project by detailed measurements in Framstredet. The Norwegian
Meteorological Institute, the Norwegian Polar
Institute, the Institute of Marine Research,
Norwegian universities and the Norwegian
Coast Guard have all contributed.

Satellite observations indicate a significant
reduction in the annual minimum size of the
Arctic ice cap since the end of the 1970s. In
order to map ice conditions, the thickness of
the ice must also be measured. However, this
is difficult, and measurement of the thickness
of the ice over large areas was first made
possible by the International Polar Year. In

## THE GOVERNMENT’S HIGH NORTH STRATEGY


**The 22 action points of the High North**
**Strategy**

The main priorities of the Government’s High
North Strategy presented 1 December 2006
have been followed up through 22 specific
action points. The status summary shows
that most of these action points were either
implemented or started by March 2009.

**1. Further develop the active dialogue with**
**neighbours, partners and allies on High**
