A Message


from the Minister

Looking back on the past year, I believe 2006 was meaningful in that
the ROK Armed Forces made extensive achievements for the
development of national defense capabilities while maintaining a stable
national defense posture. In particular, the enactment of the National
Defense Reform Act was significant in that the Act laid out a legal and
systemic basis to push ahead with a more future-oriented national
defense. Hence, the Act makes possible a remarkable reform of the
national defense system that has existed for more than 50 years.

The ROK Armed Forces currently face numerous challenges in a
rapidly changing security environment. In July and October 2006, the
DPRK test-fired missiles and carried out nuclear tests despite
repeated warnings from the ROK government and the international
community. As a result, the actions caused grave concern and alarm
by threatening peace and security in Northeast Asia.

The DPRK’s nuclear weapons development has affected our national
defense posture in no small way. In particular, there is a spectrum of
uncertainty, associated with resolving the DPRK nuclear issue, that
can confront us in various shapes and forms.

The ROK government and the international community have made
multifaceted efforts toward a peaceful resolution of the DPRK nuclear
issue. To support these efforts,the ROK Armed Forces should provide
strong military backing to achieve a practical resolution of the DPRK
nuclear problem. In addition, there is a mountain of work to do
regarding other security concerns and issues.

One of the purposes of national defense reform is to meet civil
society’s demand for developing the ROK military into an advanced
one by effectively improving national defense management capabilities


-----

in line with advances in science and information technology.

National defense reform should continuously make progress,
without setbacks, because it is a national task-- one that guarantees
our national survival and prosperity in the 21[st ]century. Also, it
might be a golden opportunity to transform the ROK military into an
advanced, elite, and strong force.

At this year’s ROK-US Security Consultative Meeting, the two
countries reached an agreement to transform the existing US-led
and ROK-supported system to a “supporting-supported”system in
defense of the Korean Peninsula. Many tasks remain in order to
achieve such a new framework for the future ROK-US alliance. We
should clearly recognize that we have reached a point whereby
properly managing this transformation process encourages
development of an allied defense posture that best suits the changed
security environment. In addition, we should take this opportunity to
upgrade our alliance to a higher level.

The strength of our national defense comes from the people.
Popular support and trust is a prerequisite for our armed forces to
grow stronger. Our armed forces will do their best to accomplish their
missions and tasks in recognition of the importance of gaining
popular support and trust. Moreover, we should actively cope with the
challenges ahead by recognizing that these challenges could prove to
be critical issues in shaping the destiny of our national defense.

This year’s Defense White Paper purports to contain such will and
effort. I expect that the Defense White Paper 2006 to provide an
opportunity to reach consensus on national defense policies as well as
broader popular understanding of the present and future of our
armed forces. Lastly, I sincerely ask for the people’s continued
interest in and support for our national defense.

December 29, 2006

Minister of National Defense  Kim, Jang Soo

Chapter Changes and Challenges in the Security Environment
1

Today’s global security environment has become diverse and complex
as threats to national security have become diverse and complex. While
countries are trying to maximize their own national interests, they are
pursuing strategic coalitions at the same time with mutual checks for
stability and peace of the international community.

Since the September 11 terrorist attacks, in particular, the world has
been making efforts to counter terrorism and thwart the proliferation of
weapons of mass destruction (WMD) in order to prevent terrorism and the
spread of WMD that has been regarded as a serious threat to the peace
and stability of the international community.

On the other hand, growing regional conflicts stemming from diverse
causes are threatening world peace and stability.

1. Pursuing National Interests
through Strategic Coalitions and Checks

The striking characteristic of the
contemporary global security environment is
that the nature of threats has become diverse
and complex. For example, transnational
and non-military threats including terrorism
and proliferation of WMD has increased.
Causes for conflicts that had been kept latent
in the past exploded although the possibility
of a large-scale war has disappeared.
In this security environment, countries in
the world are making efforts to maximize their national interests. They are
strengthening security capabilities not only to promote their national
interests but also to shape the security environment to their favor. At the
same time, they are pursuing national interests through strategic coalitions
and checks.


-----

Section 1. Global Security Environment


On the other hand, the United States has taken the
initiative to form a new international security order
including the proliferation security initiative (PSI)
as the United States has engaged the anti-terror
war since the 9/11 attacks. As major countries
participate in this international trend, the US-led
international order is expected to continue in the
future.
Russia, China, and a few leading European
countries disclosed their attitudes to check the US
government, which took an offensive strategy by expanding the
security concept. The European Union (EU) recognized the need for their
own approach to a new security environment in consideration of the US
unilateral approach since the 9/11 attacks in consideration of the disputes
over the Iraq War between the United States and Europe, and the issues of
WMD proliferation. Accordingly, they are enacting the European Security
Strategy by forming an international order on the basis of effective
multilateralism, building close relationship with their neighboring countries in
the EU, and taking measures to new threats stemming from nuclear
proliferation efforts of certain countries.
Most striking in the process of the new security order building is that the
United States and China are competitively expanding their cooperation and
exchanges with India which has recently demonstrated rapid economic
growth. In March 2006, President Bush visited India and agreed with Prime
Minister Manmohan Singh to strengthen bilateral strategic ties and signed the
Joint Statement for the development of nuclear energy for civilian
applications. Additionally, the United States agreed to sell advanced fighters
to India. Such a strategic partnership between the United States and India
heralds a new page for the Asian regional order. On the other hand, in
Novemer, 2006 Chinese Premier Hu Jintao and Indian Prime Minister
Manmohan Singh agreed to promote cooperation and improve strategic
relationship by signing as many as 13 agreements.
What draws international attention in international dynamics to secure
energy resources at a time of skyrocketing energy prices has emerged as a
new variable in international order. The importance of energy security
increased as the anxiety of stable supply of the Middle East oil arose with
the growing instability due to the 9/11 terror and subsequent Iraq War. As


PSI (Proliferation Security
Initiative):
The PSI is the initiative to
prevent proliferation of
weapons of mass destruction,
their delivery vehicles, and
related materials by countries
of concern and terrorist
groups. The United States
took the lead with ten other
countries in Asia and in
Europe to launch the PSI and
currently 80 countries are
participating in the PSI.

big power countries in the world are competing to seek new energy
sources, the fluidity of corresponding regional politics is increasing
accordingly.
In conclusion, countries are making coalitions to ensure peace and
stability of the international community in the recent global security
environment, while at the same time countries are pursuing mutual checks
and cooperation to maximize their own national interests depending on the
nature of issues given the security environment.

2. International Efforts to Counter Terrorism
and WMD Proliferation


As countries gain easier access to the weaponization technology for
WMD, with the development of cutting-edge science and technology and
information telecommunications, a few countries such as Iran and North
Korea are making efforts to possess WMDs in order to raise national
prestige, promote economic interests, and enhance military security, etc.
That certain countries are technologically capable of developing nuclear
weapons and long-range missiles and can acquire components and materials
necessary for the development of such weapons readily through illicit
international deals has become a factor with negative impact on
international security. Equally worrisome is the fact that not only minor
powers, but also terrorist groups, can acquire biochemical weapons,
including anthrax and sarin gas, easily because of their cheap and simple
fomulas.
Furthermore, as the terrorist organization that initiated the 9/11 attacks
became known to be Al Qaeda, who has an international terrorist network,
the fact that it is not a country’s matter but a global matter to prevent and
counter the terrorism and WMD proliferation led the world to recognize the
importance of international cooperation to prevent and counter the terrorism
and WMD proliferation. Therefore, measures to counter terrorism and
proliferation of WMD on a global level have been specified. This signifies
that counter-terrorism and nonproliferation has become the core issue for
international security for a considerable period of time.
For instance, in its National Security Strategy (NSS) released on March 16,
2006, the United States announced four steps to win the War on Terror: (1)
prevent attacks by terrorist networks before they occur; (2) deny WMD to

rogue states and to terrorist allies who would use them without hesitation;
(3) deny terrorist groups the support and sanctuary of rogue states; and (4)
deny the terrorists control of any nation that they would use as a base and
launching pad for terror. These steps clearly demonstrate the strong will of
the United States to uproot the terrorism.
The EU has also adopted a declaration on anti-terrorism in the summit
meeting which convened on March 25 and 26, 2004 and strengthened
cooperation to counter terrorism by promoting information exchanges,
judiciary cooperation, border control, suspension of terrorist fund, etc.
Regarding the issue of terrorism and WMD proliferation, countries in the
world are strengthening international and regional cooperation in the areas
such as counter-terrorism information exchanges, investigation cooperation,
and detection and delivery of terrorists in order to establish the international
regime for counter-terrorism and WMD nonproliferation. In addition, nonmilitary measures to cut off terrorist funding and support the
democratization process of the terror-prone countries are gaining political
saliency.
International efforts to prevent proliferation of WMD are continuing
under the international agreements such as the Nuclear Nonproliferation
Treaty (NPT), Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), Biological Weapons
Convention (BWC), and Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR), and by
international organizations such as the International Atomic Energy Agency
(IAEA). Moreover, the existing nonproliferation regime has been reinforced
by the PSI.

3. Persisting Regional Instability
and Local Disputes

Due to complex factors such as disputes over territory and natural
resources, religious, and racial and ethnic conflicts, and secessionist
independence movements, a variety of local conflicts are continuing in
many places around the globe. As of December 2006, the Iraq War is
continuing since March 2003, and the seed of war is remaining despite the
end of the Israel and Lebanese War. The Civil War in Sudan lasting for 21
years since 1983 remains latent, at present, due to issues such as multiethnic compositions and power transfer. Likewise, local conflicts small and
big alike are continuing in many places around the globe.

In Iraq, increasing ethnic conflicts between the Shiites and Sunnis, and
conflicts among political parties to control the political power, rendered the
security situation in Iraq so tense that the stabilization operation that
multinational forces originally planned to conduct is facing difficulties. With
the inauguration of the Hamas cabinet that does not recognize, in principle,
Israel, violent conflicts erupted between the two sides and the situation
became tense. Situations in the Middle East are still unstable as shown in the
Israelis’invasion into the southern Lebanon and subsequent fierce battles
between them.
In Central Asia, Ukraine, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan are experiencing
instability in their democratization and power transfer process. Around the
coastal area of the Caspian Sea, heated competition among related countries
and big powers over oil and gas resources adds concerns to the existing
anxiety in this region, thus destabilizing the region.
In South Asia, conflicts between India and Pakistan constitute an
instability factor to the region. In the
past, they experienced three large armed
conflicts over Kashmir. Nevertheless, the
two countries recently made diplomatic
efforts to reduce tension including the
prevention of armed conflicts, though
they engaged in an arms competition to
develop nuclear weapons and missiles.
In summary, armed conflicts among
nations are continuing due to regional
instabilities even after the end of the
Cold War. Local disputes resulting from

races, resources and religions are
continuing. Violation of human rights, refugees, poverty, and terror
occurring from armed and local conflicts are becoming imminent issues for
the international community to tackle.

Section 2. Security Situation in Northeast Asia

In the midst of the global trend of easing tension and increasing
cooperation, economic cooperation and interdependence is deepening in
Northeast Asia. However, structural conflict stemming from North Korea’s
nuclear issue surfaced together with conflicting factors such as the Cross
Strait relations, history disputes, and territorial disputes.

While the biggest military powers of the world are concentrated in the
region, countries are making efforts to modernize their military forces.
Countries in the region are competing to expand their influences and thus
regional instabilities arise.

On the other hand, the structure of checks and rivalry is also
deepening, while countries in the region are competing for more

moves to extend the activity sphere of its Self-Defense Forces to
the world beyond the Indian Ocean and, at the same time, is
pursuing “a normal military force of a normal state.”
In response to the strengthening of the bilateral alliance
between the United States and Japan, China and Russia have been
strengthening their strategic partnership. However, China and the
United States are making progress in the area of military exchanges
and cooperation, while improving exchanges and cooperation in
many other areas.
In conclusion, uncertainties stemming from traditional conflicts
and rivalries are increasing with the remaining Cold War structure
in Northeast Asia. They are exerting efforts to ensure a leading role
and status in the midst of dynamic security relations among great
powers in the region.

2. Current Security Issues in Northeast Asia

Northeast Asia is the region where security situations are tenser
than any other region. North Korea’s nuclear issue is not only the
most serious threat but also challenges the security of Northeast
Asia and the world. As North Korea conducted a nuclear test on
October 9, 2006, the international community imposed sanctions
on North Korea and North Korea reacted strongly to such
sanctions. Accordingly, instability is increasing in Northeast Asian
security.
The United States and Japan took measures such as financial
sanctions and the PSI vis-a-vis North Korea in close coordination
with each other. China and Russia are making efforts in order to
implement the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1718 in
spite of their opposition to full-fledged containment of North
Korea.
On top of North Korea’s nuclear issue, the Cross-Straits issue,
diverging views on history between countries in the region,
concerns about territorial claims add to regional frictions.
China adopted a political resolution to strongly oppose
independence of Taiwan in accordance with the “One-China
Principle”at the 4th Plenary Session of the 10[th] National People’s

Congress on March 14, 2006 when she celebrated the first
anniversary of enacting the “Anti-Secession Law.”Tension across
the Straits heightened because Taiwanese President Chen Shui-bian
announced the intent to accomplish Taiwan’s independence at any
costs, one day before the National People’s Congress resolution.
On the other hand, Japan’s major politicians pay visits to the
Yasukuni Shrine and some conservative groups beautify the past
history of their invasion of Northeast Asia. This aroused concerns
of neighboring countries because such behavior is detrimental to
the improvement of peace in Northeast Asia.
Moreover, there remain territorial disputes such as disputes
over the Senkaku (Diaoyudao for the Chinese) Islands between
China and Japan, and disputes over four Northern Islands between
Japan and Russia. Since the sea surrounding the Senkaku Islands is
known to preserve natural gas and oil reserves, China, Japan and
Taiwan claim territorial rights one another.
In relation to the establishment of the Exclusive Economic Zone
(EEZ), countries in the region adhere to their own positions in
order to utilize the ocean space for economic benefits. Differences
in their positions regarding the EEZ become factors for potential
conflicts.

3. Military Trends of Major Countries in the Region


From the military point of view, the United States, Japan, China,
and Russia had been competing with each other to maintain and
expand their influence in this region, despite the lack of a
multilateral security cooperative regime in place, unlike Europe.
Furthermore, most countries in the region are pursuing military
transformation and technical innovation in order to modernize and
enhance their military capabilities under the new security
environment. Up-to-date military posture of the four major powers
surrounding the Korean Peninsula is depicted in Figure 1-1.

its brigade-centered military structure with the concept of a joint
force by pursuing military transformation continuously.
In the Northeast Asian region, the US forces are undergoing
restructuring and the relocation plan of the US forces in Korea was
agreed at the 2004 Security Consultative Meeting (SCM) between
the Republic of Korea and the United States and is currently being
implemented. On May 1st, 2006, the United States and Japan
announced a document titled “the US-Japan Roadmap for
Realignment Implementation”that detailed the US plans to relocate
8,000 Marines stationed in Okinawa to Guam and the US ⅠCorps
Command to Camp Zama in Japan.
At present, US forces in Northeast Asia also maintain one
Carrier Strike Group (CSG), eight fighter squadrons, and Airborne
Warning and Control System (AWACS). They are equipped with
information collection systems and intelligence war systems that
can collect, analyze, and evaluate gathered information so that they
can be used readily for operations and precision strike capabilities
connected to information war system.

B. Japan

In March 2006, Japan abolished the Joint Staff Council and
founded a new Joint Staff Office and made a transition to a joint
operations posture. This initiative meant to allow the Chief of Staff
to command and control the Ground, Maritime, and Air SelfDefense Forces, and assist the operational control by the DirectorGeneral of the Defense Agency. At the same time, the initiative
strengthened the authority of the Director-General of the Defense
Agency by placing the Defense Intelligence Headquarters under
the direct command of the Director-General of the Defense
Agency. Moreover, Japan took measures to upgrade the Defense
Agency to the Ministry of Defense (MOD) by submitting the
Ministry of Defense Establishment Law to the Diet in June 2006 and
got it passed through the Diet on December 15th, 2006. Therefore,
the status of the Self-Defense Forces has been enhanced.
The Self-Defense Forces maintain some 240,000 military
personnel. To achieve the military transformation in the

China’s military strategy is “to win local wars under conditions
of advanced technology”and is to pursue informationization and
mechanization. The People’s Liberation Army (PLA) seeks to build
a strong military force enhancing defense-related science and
technology, by restructuring military structure, and by strenthening
total war conducting capabilities. Based on those strategic
concepts, China is continuously pursuing military modernization
and increasing defense expenditure based on rapid economic
growth in order to build a strong military force. The Army aims at
moving from regional defense to trans-regional mobility. The Navy
aims at a gradual extension of the strategic depth for offshore
defensive operation. The Air Force aims at having long-distance
operation capabilities. In addition, the PLA ensures that it will be

On the other hand, China reduced 200,000
troops between 2003 and 2005. The PLA currently

D. Russia

Russia seeks to restore its stature as a superpower by enhancing
its military power through building up its military capabilities
qualitatively and restructuring. In 2005, Russia shifted from a five
service system consisting of ground, navy, air force, strategic force,
and space force to three services (ground, naval, and air), and
three independent corps (strategic missile force, space force, and
airborne force).
By 2006, Russia reduced its troops from 1.2 million to 1.03
million and it will maintain such a troop level. While Russia will
maintain the combined system of conscript and contract in the
foreseeable future, it will shift to an all-volunteer system in the long
run. The number of soldiers who are serving in the army on a
contract basis amounts to 55 percent of the total troops and the
number will increase to 70 percent by 2008.
In the case of strategic weapons, their
numbers decreased. Russia maintains a rapid
response posture by deploying new mobile
Topol-M ICBMs. Bulava (SS-NX-30) SLBMs,
which is a modified version of the Topol-M,
for the use of sea-based launch are under
development and will be deployed to strategic
nuclear submarines in 2008. At the same time,
Russia pursues to have strategic deterrent
capabilities by upgrading the Tu-160 Blackjack

Section 3. North Korean Situation and Military Threat

In the 2006 New Year’s Joint Editorial, North Korea stressed that the
essence of the national policy is to improve the living conditions of its
populace and promote economic development by focusing on the
“military-first politics”and the “strong and prosperous socialist nationbuilding.”

However, North Korea’s isolation from the international community
deepens due to its illicit activities including counterfeit money and
cigarettes, missile test launches, and a nuclear test in addition to
worsening relations between the two Koreas.

In the military aspect, North Korea’s quantitatively favorable
conventional military power and continued development of weapons of
mass destruction including nuclear and missiles still pose the greatest
threat to the security of the Korean Peninsula and the Northeast Asian
region.


1. North Korea’s Current Situation

A. Domestic Situation

- Military-civilian ceremony for the successful nuclear test


Under the banner of the
“military-first politics,”North
Korea is striving to stabilize the
regime with Chairman of the
National Defense Committee,
Kim Jong-il at the epicenter of
the regime. North Korea is
making efforts to maintain the
regime by reorganizing the
party-government apparatus
and by setting up a new economic
development strategy. After the nuclear test, North Korea sought to

-----

Chapter Changes and Challenges in the Security Environment

cement internal unity and promote national pride by holding a
military-civilian ceremony in order to celebrate its successful
nuclear test.
On the economic front, since North Korea has been suffering
from the chronic shortage of food and energy, North Korea is
trying to conduct economic reform and construct social
infrastructure in order to overcome such shortages. North Korea
emphasized the importance of increased production of agricultural
products and necessities of life in order to improve basic living

☞Refer to Appendix 2
“Comparison of Economic conditions of the people and build social infrastructure for
Indices of South & North
Korea.” sustained economic development. Nevertheless, economic

conditions aggravated recently due to both sanctions imposed by
the international community after North Korea’s nuclear test and
natural disasters such as flooding.
In the meanwhile, the North Korean government is tightening
the society in order to shut down the inflow of external information
resulting from increasing exchanges with the outside world and
curbing visits to North Korea by members of the non-governmental
organizations (NGO). North Korea is also
intensifying ideological indoctrination of
its populace and internal control in order
to prevent deviant behaviors and
defectors.
On the military front, Chairman Kim
Jong-il has increased significantly visits to
military bases, since North Korea rejected
attending the Six Party Talks in November
2005 (from 30 times between January and

- Chairman of the National Defence Committee, October 2005 to 64 times between
Kim Jong-il’s visit to a military base

November 2005 and June 2006). It is
assessed that Chairman Kim Jong-il’s activities are meant to
encourage the North Korean military to strengthen their war
preparedness in case of worsening situations including additional
sanctions led by the United States, and to consolidate unity within
North Korean society by instigating loyalty.


-----

Section 3. North Korean Situation and Military Threat

The North Korean military seeks to develop missiles by making
test launches of new surface-to-surface missiles and ground-to-sea
missiles. At the same time, the military seeks to strengthen core
combat capabilities such as the Cheonma tanks and the long-range
artillery munitions through test-firing those munitions.
In order to strengthen the state of readiness, the North Korean
military conducted mechanized maneuver exercises, joint landing
exercises in the East and West Sea, and reconnaissance flights over
the West Sea.

B. Foreign Policy

North Korea and the United States disclosed fundamental
differences on how to resolve North Korea’s nuclear issue. Their
mutual relations aggravated due to North Korea’s nuclear test in
defiance of Washington’s warnings. It is expected that the North's
improvement of relations with the United States will depend on
how the Six Party Talks will resolve North Korea’s nuclear issue.
North Korea strongly denounced Japan for its focus on the
abduction issue, conservative tendency, and efforts to build a
missile defense system. Friction between North Korea and Japan is
growing after Japan took measures to intensify sanctions on the
North after the North’s missile test launches and nuclear test.
On the other hand, North Korea is trying to obtain support from
China and Russia through bilateral summit meetings and exchanges
of high level officials of the party, government, and the military.
Nevertheless, diplomatic conflicts between them occurred because
China and Russia agreed to the UN Security Council resolution that
stipulated sanctions against North Korea after Pyongyang’s
nuclear test.

C. Policy toward South Korea

Since the June 15th 2000 inter-Korean summit,
Pyongyang pursues economic interests through South-North

- Reunion of separated families


-----

Chapter Changes and Challenges in the Security Environment
1

exchanges and cooperation programs such as the Gaeseong
Industrial Complex and the Mt. Geumgang tourism project while
maintaining government-to-government contacts including
ministerial talks. On the other hand, North Korea conspires to split
South Korean society in the name of national unity and to pit South
Korea against the United States by agitating anti-American struggles
and insisting upon withdrawal of US forces from Korea.
As noted above, North Korea is very active in securing
economic benefits from the South-North exchanges and
cooperation. However, North Korea shows lukewarm attitude
when it comes to the issues like tension reduction and military
confidence-building leading to the peace building on the Korean
Peninsula.

2. North Korea’s Military Policy, Strategy,
and Command Organization


North Korea's Four-point
Military Guidelines:
1. Fortification of the entire
nation
2. Armament of the entire
populace
3. Modernization of military
equipment
4. Conversion of all servicemen
into cadres


A. Military Policy and Strategy

Since its adoption of the “Four-point Military Guidelines”as the
backbone of the military policy in 1962, North Korea has been
preparing for a war for a substantial period, and is expected to
continue such military policy. North Korea is continuously
enhancing its military capabilities by investing national resources
primarily on defense in spite of worsening economic problems.
In light of conditions of the Korean Peninsula, North Korea’s
military strategy intends to win the war within a short period of
time with surprise and breakthrough warfare before the arrival of
US reinforcements. The core of its military strategy is to execute a
surprise attack at an early stage, to grasp the military initiative
combined with a warfare strategy including regular and irregular
warfare, and to expand the initial victory by concentrating
firepower and mechanized and self-propelled maneuver units. To
do so, major combat capabilities are deployed to the south of the
Pyongyang-Wonsan line.


-----

Section 3. North Korean Situation and Military Threat

- North Korea's military exercises


In the meantime, its actual defense
expenditure is expected to exceed
the number that the government
officially announces.
The North Korean Supreme
People’s Assembly announced in
the 4[th] meeting of their 11[th] term
that its 2006 defense expenditure takes
up 15.9 percent of the national budget.


Given the unique nature of the North Korean
regime and budget system, actual defense expenditure is expected
to amount to 30 percent of the Gross National Income (GNI).
It is known that the defense expenditure is not only covered by
the official defense budget but also supplemented by the military
economy (secondary economy), arms sales, and foreign currency
earning activities by military units.

B. Military Command Organization

The National Defense Committee (NDC) is the highest military
command organization in North Korea. The Constitution stipulates
that the National Defense Committee be the entity which decides
and supervises overall defense programs.
The Ministry of People’s Armed Forces exercises the authority
to administer military affairs including military diplomacy, logistics,
and military finance, and to represent the military externally. The


☞ Refer to Appendix 3
“North Korea’s Annual
Defense Expenditure.”

General Political Bureau supervises the Workers’Party organs
within the military and relevant political indoctrination programs,
while the General Staff Department exercises actual operational
control over the military under the unified military system.
Though the stature and functions of the Ministry of People’s
Armed Forces weakened relatively as the Chairman of the NDC,
Kim Jong-il directly controls the Minister of People’s Armed Forces,
Director of General Political Bureau, and Chief of General Staff, the
Ministry still represents the military externally. The Ministry of
Armed Forces is placed under the NDC and North Korea’s military
command structure is represented in Figure 1-2.

3. Organization, Equipment and Deployment

A. Army

The North Korean army consists of a total of 19 corps level
units, in which there are nine frontal and rear corps, four
mechanized corps, one tank corps, one artillery corps, the


-----

Section 3. North Korean Situation and Military Threat

Pyongyang Defense Command, Border Guard
Command, Missile Guidance Bureau, and Lightinfantry Instruction Bureau. Major combat units
comprise more than 170 divisions and brigades
including 75 infantry divisions (including instruction
divisions), 30 artillery brigades, 10 tank brigades, 20
mechanized brigades, 25 special warfare brigades,

- Cheonma-class tanks

and 10 other brigades.
The North deployed approximately seventy
percent of its ground forces along the south of the
Pyongyang and Wonsan line, positioning four corps
in the front with one tank corps, two mechanized
corps, and one artillery corps in the rear. The
massive forces deployed forward enable the North
to initiate a standing start attack without
redeployment in the event of contingency.
Out of the North’s military offensive capabilities,

- 170 mm self-propelled artillery

T-50 tanks constitute major sources of threat. To upgrade
those tanks, the North replaced the main artillery part of the
existing T-62 tanks and attached response armors to those and
produced and deployed Cheonma-class tanks. In particular, 170
mm self-propelled artillery and 240 mm multiple rocket launchers
deployed in the frontline are capable of carrying out massive
surprise bombardment against the Seoul metropolitan area from
their current locations.
Additionally, it is expected that North Korean special warfare
units comprising around 120,000 troops including those of frontline
special warfare units will infiltrate into the entire area of the South
and will plunge the rear areas of the South into chaos. If the North
uses underground tunnels located at major access roads in the front
to invade the South together with surprise attack, the surprise effect
will likely double.

Among its warships, surface combatants
comprise mostly small-sized, high-speed vessels
including light frigates, patrol ships, guided
missile boats, torpedo boats and fire support
boats. Among those, guided missile boats carry
two to four surface-to-surface missiles.
Currently, 60 percent of combatants remain
deployed in forward naval bases.
North Korea holds 60 submarines including - Komar-class guided missile ship
Romeo-class and Sango (Shark)-class submarines
and over 10 Yugo-class submersibles. These can perform missions of
laying mines, attacking surface ships, and supporting operations by
special warfare units. Support ships include landing vessels such as
landing ships, high-speed landing craft, and landing craft air
cushioned (LCAC), as well as minesweepers.
The Navy holds two sniper brigades and more than 260 troop
transport vessels including 130 LCACs and 90 high-speed landing
craft. The LCAC can maneuver at a high speed of 40 to 52 kts.

C. Air Force

The North Korean Air Force comprises four air divisions, two
tactical transportation brigades, two sniper brigades, five surface-to
-air missile brigades, and three radar regiments under the central
control of the Air Force Command. The holdings of North Korean
aircraft are shown in Figure 1-5.

deploys major air force capabilities to the four districts in the
southwest, northwest, east, northeast of the country. In particular,
the North is capable of attacking deep into the
South by flying AN-2s at low altitudes and low
speed.
The air bases include twenty operational
bases, reserve bases, contingency runways, etc.
Most of the air bases have underground hangars
and shelters so as to enhance survivability. The
surface-to-air missile unit deploys long-range
high altitude SA-5 missiles to the east and west,
while densely deploying SA-2/3 missiles to

D. Reserve Forces


North Korea maintains a gigantic garrison
state whose entire populace is armed in
accordance with the “Four-point Military
Guidelines.”At present, around thirty percent
of its population aged fourteen to sixty
constitutes the 7.7 million reserve forces that
are subject to both mobilization for war time
and military training for 15 to 30 days a year.
North Korean reserve forces consist of the
Reserve Training Units (620,000: men aged
from 17 to 50, single women aged from 17 to
30), Worker and Peasant Red Guard Units
(5,720,000) equivalent to the South Korea’s

E. Development of Strategic Weapons

(1) Nuclear Development

In the 1960s, North Korea constructed the nuclear complex in
Yongbyon. In the 1970s, it concentrated its nuclear research on
nuclear fuel milling, conversion, and fabrication technologies.
Since the 1980s, it had completed the “nuclear fuel cycle”ranging
from the acquisition of nuclear fuels to the reprocessing of spent
fuels by operating the 5-megawatt reactor and reprocessing plants.
At the same time, it is believed that North Korea conducted
numerous explosive tests.
It has been speculated that the North has produced one or two
nuclear bombs using 10 to 14 kg of plutonium that it extracted before
the 1994 Geneva Agreed Framework. Since then, it is assessed that
the North could additionally obtain more than 30 kg of plutonium if it
completed reprocessing of spent fuels taken out of the reactor
between 2003 and 2005. On October 9th, 2006, Pyongyang
conducted its nuclear test surprisingly soon after it announced the
plan for a nuclear test, as international sanctions and pressures on
Pyongyang got intensified after its missile test launches in July 2006.
Meanwhile, suspicion that North Korea may have developed the
highly enriched uranium (HEU) program including the introduction
of relevant components of centrifugal separators has been raised. The
South Korean government and concerned countries together pursue
related information about the North’s HEU program.

(2) Medium- and Long-range Missiles

In the 1970s, North Korea embarked on a project to develop


Nuclear Fuel Cycle:
The entire process in
which uranium ore is
processed in a reactor
after mining and milling,
conversion, enrichment
and fabrication and
then undergoes a
series of steps
including reprocessing,
recycling and eventual
disposal as high-level
waste.

ballistic missiles. In the mid-1980s, it
successfully test-fired a Scud-B missile with
the range of 300 km, which was followed by
its production and operational deployment
of 500 km-range Scud-Cs. In the 1990s, the
North test-fired a 1,300 km-range Rodong
missile and deployed those missiles for
operational purposes.
In August 1998, Pyongyang unsuccessfully
test-launched Taepodong-I missiles. Although

- Taepodong-I missile the attempt failed, it is assessed that North

Korea has the ability to develop mediumand long-range missiles judging from the experiment of the missile’s
various functions including engine combustion, multi-stage body
separation, etc.
At present, Pyongyang is developing a long-range TaepodongII missile. In July 2006, the North test-launched Taepodong-II type,
Scud, and Rodong missiles, thereby raising tension on the Korean
Peninsula and in Northeast Asia. The range of the Taepodong-II is
expected to go beyond 6,700 km and the range will be able to be
extended if the weight of the delivery body is reduced or threestage rockets are loaded additionally.

(3) Biochemical Weapons


In December 1961, North Korea launched its chemical weapons
development programs including research and construction of
production facilities in compliance with Kim Il-sung’s “Declaration
of Chemicalization.”It is assessed that Pyongyang has been
producing poison gas and biological weapons since the 1980s.
It is believed that approximately 2,500 to 5,000 tons of a variety
of agents including nerve agents remain stored in a number of
facilities scattered around the country and that North Korea is able
to produce biological weapons such as the bacteria of anthrax,
small pox, and cholera.


Declaration of
Chemicalization:
On December 25, 1961,
Kim Il-sung ordered the
North Korean military to
chemicalize the North
Korean armed forces and
to recognize the
importance of chemical
warfare.

Chapter Basic Tenets of the National Defense Policy
2

National security strategies are national activities that accomplish a
nation’s interests and national security objectives comprehensively and
systematically by mobilizing available resources and means.

The Participatory Government derived national interests based on
Constitutional ethos, established the national security objectives and the
guidelines of national security strategy considering the security
environments and national power, and then set up the “National Security
Strategic Guidelines”as a result.

1. National Interest and National Security Objectives

National interest implies the values that a country should
protect and promote to achieve its national security and
prosperity continuously in the long term, and consistently
under any security environment.
Under the Constitution of the Republic of Korea, the
Participatory Government defined the national
interest as: (1) Ensuring National Security; (2)
Promotion of Liberal Democracy and Human
Rights; (3) Economic Development and
Promotion of Public Welfare; (4) Peaceful
Unification of the Korean Peninsula; and (5) Contribution to World
Peace and shared Prosperity for Mankind.
As a result, the Government safeguards the people, territory,
and sovereignty to ensure the survial of the Republic; promotes
democracy and basic values such as liberty, equality, and human
dignity; pursues national economic prosperity and promote public
welfare; develops inter-Korean relations of peaceful coexistence
and achieves national unification; and expands our international
role and promotes universal values.


-----

Section 1. National Security Strategy Guidelines of the Participatory Government

National Security objectives are set to safeguard the national
security, an essential element of our national interest. They must
be attained through an accurate assesment of the current security
environment and available national resources. The Government
has set the following as national security objectives to promote our
national interest: (1) Peace and Stability on the Korean Peninsula;
(2) Common Prosperity of South and North Korea and Northeast
Asia; and (3) Assurance of Public Safety.
“Peace and Stability on the Korean Peninsula”is to pursue firm
security conditions and possess corresponding ability,
guaranteeing enduring peace through building a peace regime on
the Korean Peninsula.
“Common Prosperity of South and North Korea and Northeast
Asia”is to accomplish the development of the South-North
relationship based on reconciliation and cooperation and to
improve collaboration in Northeast Asia in order to construct the
foundation of coprosperity for countries within the region.
In addition, “Assurance of Public Safety”is to guarantee
security of citizens from various security threats by expanding areas
of national security to individual safety.

2. Principles of the National Security Strategy
and Promotion of Cooperative Self-Reliant Defense

The Government specified the following four basic tenets of its
strategies for accomplishing national security objectives, putting
forward detailed guidelines for policies of each area.
First, for the “pursuit of the policy of peace and prosperity,”the
government will settle peace on the Korean Peninsula, pursue
coprosperity of South Korea and North Korea, and build a
foundation for peaceful unification.
Second, for the “conduct of balanced and pragmatic diplomacy,”
the government will pursue the achievement of balance in the
process of policy making and execution as well as apply diplomatic
flexibility to realize its security objectives.
Third, in an effort for the “promotion of cooperative self-reliant
defense,”the government will pursue simultaneous development


-----

Chapter Basic Tenets of the National Defense Policy
2


of self-reliant defense capabilities and the ROK-US alliance to
establish a firm security posture.
Fourth, for the “development of comprehensive security,”the
government will strengthen its security competencies so that Korea
can deal with external non-military threats at home and from
abroad and can meet various security challenges effectively.
Among these, the promotion of cooperative self-reliant defense
is what the MND should realize in the defense area. The
government aims at deterring North Korea’s war provocations, and
developing capabilities and systems to be able to defeat North
Korea at wartime. The Participatory Government concentrates its
efforts on a national level to promote cooperative self-reliant
defense as one of the principles of the national security strategy by
utilizing the ROK-US alliance and by improving external security
relations.
Accordingly, the MND established a “plan of cooperative selfreliant defense”to implement the Presidential Strategic Guidelines.
The MND endeavors to develop capabilities and systems by which
it can take the initiative in deterring war provocations by the North,
while promoting the ROK-US alliance from a future-oriented
perspective and proactively taking advantage of multilateral
security cooperation.
To develop self-reliant capabilities, the MND ironed out the
“Defense Reform 2020”and proactively pursues to build an
advanced, elite, and strong force for the 21st century.


Non-Military Threats:

-----

Section 2. Objectives and Implementation Directions of the National Defense Policy

In order to attain the national security objectives in the face of rapidly
changing security environments and various defense conditions, the ROK
Ministry of National Defense defines national defense objectives and
pursues national defense policies in a consistent and effective manner.

The present defense objectives, which were established in 1972 and
revised in 1981 and in 1994, are consistent with the national security
objectives and national security strategy principles set by the Participatory
Government in 2004.

1. National Defense Objectives

- The ROK Senior Commanders’Meeting in December 2006

The MND has set the defense objectives as follows: “defending
the nation from external military threats and invasion, upholding
the peaceful unification, and contributing to regional stability and
world peace.”The specific meanings of those objectives are as
follows:
First, “defending the nation from external military threats and


-----

Chapter Basic Tenets of the National Defense Policy

invasion”signifies protecting the country not only from North
Korea’s existing military threats but also from all potential threats.
In particular, North Korea’s conventional military capabilities,
nuclear tests, weapons of mass destruction, and forward military
deployment pose serious threats to our national security.
Second, “upholding peaceful unification”means contributing to
peaceful unification of the two Koreas by deterring war, easing
military tension, and bringing a permanent peace to the Korean
Peninsula.
Third, “contributing to regional stability and world peace”
demonstrates the ROK’s determination to contribute to stability and
peace in Northeast Asia by promoting cordial and cooperative
military relations with neighboring countries in accordance with the
ROK’s national stature and security capabilities. The ROK also
seeks to proactively participate in the international community’s
efforts to maintain the world peace, including UN peacekeeping
efforts.

2. Basic Directions of the National Defense Policy

To achieve national security objectives and defense objectives,
the Ministry of National Defense defined the basic directions of the
national defense policy: (1) establishment of a firm defensive
posture; (2) reinforcement of future-oriented defense capability; (3)
building an advanced defense management system; and (4)
establishment of credible image of the military.

A. Establishment of a Firm Defensive Posture

The ROK military is poised to respond immediately to any
conceivable military threat or aggression and maintains a firm
defense posture that can deter war provocations from the enemy,
and assure absolute victory in the event of armed provocations.
In particular, on the basis of the ROK-US combined defense
system that plays a pivotal role in deterring military conflicts on the
Korean Peninsula, the ROK military maintains vigilant intelligence
monitoring and early warning systems while continuously


-----

Section 2. Objectives and Implementation Directions of the National Defense Policy

developing mechanisms of crisis management and operational
concepts to safeguard the security of the Seoul Metropolitan Area.
These measures intend to address military threats including
extensive provocation, infiltration, and limited provocation by
North Korea.
The ROK is pursuing the readjustment of the US forces
stationed in the country in close consultation with the United
States, while strengthening combined combat
capabilities and readiness. It is also making various
efforts to boost its independent operational
capabilities, including the reinforcement of the JCS
organization.
In order to cope with the newly emerging threat of
international terrorism, the ROK military maintains a
posture of rapid response against any type of
conceivable terrorist attacks, by the formulation and
development of plans to counter such attacks. The
ROK military is bolstering the system of cooperation
among pertinent counter-terrorism agencies. At the
same time, it is consolidating protective measures for
critical infrastructure and providing professional
training to counter-terrorism operational units.
In addition, the ROK military is strengthening the
mental discipline of soldiers to maximize its intangible
combat capability. In particular, the military is instilling a firm
sense of national security into its soldiers by establishing soldiers’
value system, while applying systematically various mental
education programs and audio-visual aids including the Korean
Forces Network (KFN)-TV and cultural activities that consider the
recent changes in the security environment and
the needs of the new-generation soldiers.

B. Reinforcement of Future-Oriented
Defense Capabilities

To support national security objectives and
ensure a firm defense posture, the ROK


-----

Chapter Basic Tenets of the National Defense Policy
2

military endeavors to reinforce its future-oriented defense
capabilities by expanding its leading role, taking into consideration
its national strategy, international stature in politics and economy,
and changes in the ROK-US alliance.
Reinforcing future-oriented military capabilities comes from
developing the self-reliant defense posture while utilizing the
alliance and external military cooperation wisely. The self-reliant
defense and the ROK-US alliance are the two pillars of Korea’s
defense policy; building the self-reliant military force and
developing a firm ROK-US alliance, enable us to achieve the futureoriented defense.
Above all, in order to keep pace with recent developments in
the strategic environment including readjustment of the USFK, the
ROK military has developed the ROK-US alliance in a futureoriented direction. In doing so, Korea and the United States have
conducted joint studies and consultations on the issues such as the
joint vision of the future ROK-US alliance, the relocation of the US
forces in Korea, the command relationship, and development of
combined combat capabilities.
In addition, the ROK military has sought to bolster its
capabilities, not only to seize the initiative in deterring any existing
threats from North Korea, but also to secure core military
capabilities to meet with potential threats in the future. It will also
build a solid foundation for the self-reliant defense by gradually
developing its own technological ability for advanced weapon
systems and strengthening its defense industrial base.
Furthermore, in order to shape security environments in favor
of the nation’s security, the MND will promote national interests
and enhance the ROK’s international prestige, while expanding
military diplomacy efforts proactively so that military cooperation
with other countries can contribute to the peace and stability on
the Korean Peninsula.

C. Building an Advanced Defense Management System

The MND has taken measures for efficient defense management
through continuous self-evaluation and defense reform by


-----

Section 2. Objectives and Implementation Directions of the National Defense Policy

addressing changing security environments and new security
challenges. In particular, the MND has upgraded specialization and
consistency of defense management within limited defense
resources, conducting the defense reform on a large scale by
selecting reform tasks on all fronts for a low-cost and highefficiency management system.
The MND will enhance the competencies of MND civilian
government officials and upgrade their expertise so that they can
make and implement policy decisions effectively. Such an initiative
is designed to enable the MND to effectively connect national
policy with the military policy, to coordinate service interests
harmoniously, and to enable the armed forces to concentrate on
their combat missions.
Moreover, the MND promotes force structure reforms by
considering that victory in modern warfare is
determined not by number of troops but by
advanced and modern weaponry and equipment. To
do so, the ROK military will increase the composition
of officers in the troops and plan to establish an elite
military manpower system, while reducing the
number of enlisted men.
Innovating the defense management system will
enhance the efficiency of defense management

- Education to enhance MND

systems. To be specific, the MND will construct an officials' professionalism
ubiquitous defense informational environment through the
development of the logistic areas and the realization of networkcentric battlefield operation concepts. Such measures will meet
with challenges stemming from the needs for enhanced
transparency and accountability in the defense resource
management field and the increasing operation and management
costs of weapon systems due to their high-precision and
diversification.
Furthermore, the MND will provide quality combat service
support and enhance efficiency in the administration of combat
support units. The MND will expand outsourcing in those areas in
order to make standing armed forces concentrate on their combat

and other operational missions.
The MND continually pursues policies aimed at boosting
morale and promoting the welfare of soldiers by improving barrack
facilities and living environment, while upgrading the “quality of
life”of military personnel by developing the military medical
service system like those of advanced nations.

D. Establishment of the Image of a Trustworthy Military

Even a military equipped with the state-of-the-art weaponry
and equipment cannot guarantee victory if it fails to earn the trust
and support of the people. In order to establish an image of the
armed forces that is trusted by the people, the ROK military is
taking such measures as to improve the barrack culture, to realize,
the “defense administration open to the public,”and to promote
the welfare of the public.
Reform for a new barrack culture intends to create conditions
favorable for enlisted soldiers’self-development and personal
career during their service. Furthermore, the MND will establish
military conditions that help soldiers to actualize their democratic
values on the one hand and to focus their military lives on the
fulfillment of their duties by respecting their human rights during
their service time.
The ROK military will achieve an “open defense administration”
that guarantees public participation as well as openness and
transparency through various institutional reforms. In this regard, it
will enhance the fairness, transparency, and customer-oriented
nature of the current conscription administration. It will actively
disclose current defense issues and matters of public concern prior
to receiving public requests for information disclosure. It will also
seek to reflect the opinions of people from various walks of life by
increasing the involvement of civilian experts in the defense policy
formulation process.
The ROK military will strive to protect and promote safety and
interests of the people. In other words, the military is setting up
organizations and systems to provide timely support for managing
national disasters and catastrophes and recovering from those


-----

Section 2. Objectives and Implementation Directions of the National Defense Policy

emergencies. To guarantee the people’s property rights in relation
to various military activities, measures have been devised to reduce
the noise level at military airfields and firing ranges. At the same
time, the ROK military is broadening the scope of environmental
preservation and management by securing personnel dedicated to
the management of military environmental facilities and cleaning
up contaminated soil.
Furthermore, it will do its best to satisfy the people’s rights to
know and to resolve any inconvenience inflicted upon them and to
settle various civil complaints.

Since the inauguration of the Participatory Government, the MND has
continuously been pursuing the defense reform to build a cooperative selfreliant defense posture by restructuring the force structure and enhancing
the efficiency of the defense management.

In order to actively cope with changing security environments and
aspects of future warfare, the “Defense Reform 2020”intends to
reorganize military structure, to pursue the state-of-art information and
scientific force so that the ROK military can exert its integrated combat
power to its fullest extent. On the other hand, the Defense Reform 2020 is
organically connected to the development of the ROK-US alliance.

Moreover, the Defense Reform 2020 purposes to build an advanced,
elite, and strong force for the 21st century by enhancing the efficiency of
defense management and improving overall defense capabilities through
upgrading the defense manpower operation system, acquisition and
logistic support system, and defense informationization.

1. The Defense Reform 2020

The Participatory Government has continuously promoted the
defense reform in order to better cope with future warfare, while
reflecting changes in security environments. In January 2005, the
MND began to analyze problems lying in the past defense reform
efforts and identify unreasonable and inefficient factors inherent in
the Korean defense system. Based on such analyses, the MND
prepared the Defense Reform Plan 2020 while referring to the
defense reform cases of major foreign countries.
The essence of the long-term vision of the Defense Reform
2020 is to realize the self-reliant and advanced defense which can
assure peace and prosperity of the Korean Peninsula. The ROK will
be able to achieve a self-reliant military force and establish an


-----

Section 3. Defense Reform to Build an Advanced, Elite, and Strong Force

advanced defense management system through the Defense
Reform 2020 by completing technology-intensive military structure
and force systems to be able to actively cope with future security
situations and future warfare.
The MND drew up the defense reform draft through the
Defense Reform Committee, organized on June 1, 2005, within the
MND, and reported the defense reform basic plan to President Roh
Moo-hyun on September 1, 2005. At the same time, the Defense
Reform Plan was released to the general public. The goal of the
defense reform was defined to “build an advanced, elite, and
strong force and to work together with the people.”
The four key points of the Defense Reform 2020 are as follows:
First, the ROK armed forces will build their military structure
and force systems that best befit characteristics of modern warfare.
Second, the civilian workforce in the MND will be expanded,
while the military will concentrate on the fulfillment of combat
missions.
Third, the defense management system will be innovated to
promote information and science for the military force in a highly
efficient and low cost manner.
Fourth, the defense system will be transformed into a highly
efficient one by improving the barrack culture and overall national
defense.


2. Key Tasks for the Defense Reform

The MND will establish a comprehensive plan, taking the
security environment and conditions into account. The reform will
be gradually implemented in phases, with the goal of completion
by the year 2020. The following contents are the key tasks for the
Defense Reform 2020.
First of all, the ROK military will strengthen the advanced
military capability, create a high quality elite force, and develop a
force equipped with science and technology. Until 2020, the ROK
military will reduce from 680,000 troops to 500,000 troops
gradually.
The JCS will be reorganized as the central organization capable

of defense planning and operational execution. Its functions and
organizations will be strengthened so that the ROK military can
exercise the integrated military capabilities of the army, navy, and
air force.
The ROK Army will restructure it by reducing the numbers of
army corps and divisions, as reinforcing the combat capability of
each unit in twice to three times. The Army will also secure
weapons and equipment with high combat efficiency and increase
the unmanned aviation vehicles, next generation tanks, armored
personnel carriers, firepower system, simplifying the command
structure so that it can transform into a modernized organization.
Changes in the army structure are shown in Figure 2-1.

In particular, the ROK Army will integrate the FROKA (First ROK
Army) and the TROKA (Third ROK Army) to create the Ground
Operations Command (GOC), while changing the SROKA (Second
ROK Army) into the Rear Area Operations Command (RAOC).
Furthermore, the general outpost (GOP) guard systems which have
been maintained for 50 years since the Korean War will be replaced
by guard brigades equipped with advanced guard systems, which
will, in turn, reduce the number of guards and reinforce the quality of
the guard system.
The ROK Navy is building a structure suitable for threedimensional operations on surface, underwater and in the air. It
will reform its force structure from coastal defense to omnidirectional defense structure strong enough to uphold our national
interest including protecting the Sea Lines of Communications

Section 3. Defense Reform to Build an Advanced, Elite, and Strong Force

(SLOC) and marine resources and ensure the safety of the nation’s
maritime activities. The unit structure will shift from the current
structure of 3 Fleet Commands, 1 Submarine Combat Group, and 1
Naval Aviation Wing to 3 Fleet Commands (FC), 1 Submarine
Command (SC), 1 Naval Aviation Command (NAC), and 1 Maneuver
Combat Group (MCG). These changes are designed to develop the
ROK Navy’s maneuver unit structure so as to enhance operational
capabilities suitable for future battlefields. The following Figure 2-2
indicates the changes in the ROK Navy structure.

The Marine Corps will turn into a versatile structure of air-land
maneuver units and strategic island defense that is capable of
three-dimensional landing operations, rapid response operations,
and ground maneuver operations.
The ROK Air Force will develop a structure suitable for air
superiority and precision strike by constantly keeping a watchful eye
over the enemy and maintaining a high-level combat readiness posture
for immediate response, such as retaliatory strikes at peace time. The
mission of the Air Force during war is to achieve air superiority and
provide support for ground and naval operations, while securing the
military operational capabilities throughout the Korean Peninsula.
The changes of the ROK Air Force structure are shown in the
following Figure 2-3. In order to enhance air operational effectiveness,
the Air Force Northern Combat Command (AFNCC) is established
along with the Air Force Southern Combat Command (AFSCC), 9
Fighter Wings, Air Defense Artillery Command (ADAC), and Air
Defense and Control Wing (ADCW).

The reserve forces will be changed into a quality elite reserve
force by 2020. Maintaining only the critical number of reserve forces
relative to the size of standing armed forces enables the reserve
forces to function as alternative forces to regular armed forces.
In its reform of the defense management system, the ROK
Armed Forces will increase the ratio of officers and introduce a paid
volunteer system in order to reinforce professionalism, so that the
new military manpower system can correspond to a new force and
manpower structure. The ROK Armed Forces will also introduce a
new system to ensure more transparency and rationality of
personnel management. In addition, in O & M transparency,
professionalism, responsibility and efficiency will be enhanced by
innovating the defense management in general.
In the mean time, a new barrack culture will be created so that
parents can send their children to the military service without
anxiety. To help enlisted soldiers regard their military service period
as a period in their life for self-cultivation, the ROK Armed Forces
will shape conditions for self-regulated barrack life, establish an elearning system and modernize military installations.
Particular items in the Defense Reform 2020 that require
legislation will be introduced in separate bills and regulations and
will be implemented consistently. The MND will periodically
evaluate the state of its implementation and defense conditions,
and will revise and supplement the basic plans of the defense
reform, when it deems necessary, in order to address changes in
security environments.

3. The Effect of the Defense Reform

The recent Defense Reform 2020 reflects the MND’s serious
efforts to meet nationwide demand for reform. The reform holds
significance not only because it reflects the President (the Supreme
Commander) Roh Moo-hyun’s strong will to accomplish defense
reform, but because military leaders together took the lead by
accommodating the era’s call upon the defense reform.
The features of the ROK Armed Forces in 2020 are shown in the
following Figure 2-4.

<Figure 2-4> The ROK Armed Forces in the Year 2020

First, the ROK Armed Forces will possess military capability
commensurate with their advanced international stature by building
the information and science-centered advanced military force. They
will devote themselves to nurturing a military force that “sees
further, moves faster and strikes more precisely”in order to
actively cope with a rapidly changing modern warfare, being fully
equipped with advanced surveillance, maneuver, and attack
capabilities, and forming a balanced force structure among the
three military services.
Second, the ROK Armed Forces will be converted into the

economic military, managed efficiently and reasonably through an
innovative defense management system. By doing so, they will
minimize waste factors and become resources-saving armed forces.
Third, by improving the military culture and military service
environment to the level of advanced countries, the ROK Armed
Forces will heighten public awareness through active public
relations activities on defense policies and enhance public
confidence in the military.

4. Budget for the Defense Reform

The total budget for the Defense Reform 2020 between 2006 and
2020 is assessed to amount to 621 trillion won (force improvement
projects of 272 trillion won and O & M of 349 trillion won),
including 67 trillion won slated only for the defense reform. The
MND, the Ministry of Planning and Budget (MPB), and the Korea
Institute for Defense Analyses (KIDA) together reached the same
conclusion that such amount will be available for the defense
reform, given the nation’s economic growth and future government
budget trends.
In sum, as Table 2-5 indicates, the average rate of increase in
defense budget during the entire defense reform period is 6.2%,
and is within the bounds of the average annual increase rate of
7.1% in the government budget as well as in the GDP.

|<Table 2-5> Major Indicat|tors during the Defe|ense Reform Period|Col4|(unit: trillion won, %)|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Unit|’06 -’20|’06 -’10|’11 -’15|’16 -’20|
|GDP (nominal growth rate %)|22,422 (7.1)|5,085 (7.4)|7,215 (7.2)|10,122 (6.7)|
|Government Budget (annual increase % )|3,701 (7.1)|835 (6.9)|1,185 (7.4)|1,681 (6.9)|
|Defense Budget (annual increase %)|621 (6.2)|139 (9.9)|216 (7.8)|266 (1.0)|



※These defense reform budgets are estimates by research organizations as of 2006. Therefore, the
MND will amend the chart by annually examining the budget subject to changes taking place in the
defense reform.


-----

Section 3. Defense Reform to Build an Advanced, Elite, and Strong Force

As shown in Figure 2-6, annual increase rate of defense budget
during the defense reform period indicates the tendency that while
defense budget needs to be increased during the initial phases of
the reform at a certain rate, the increase rate will decrease over
time after the year 2015.

<Figure 2-6> Increase Rate of Defense Budget during the Defense Reform Period

5. Legislative Efforts for the Defense Reform


Major elements of the Defense Reform 2020 were stipulated
into a law in order to provide conditions for a consistent and
continuous reform. When a draft was ready for the bill, the MND
released to the public the objectives and basic guidelines that the
defense reform should accomplish. The MND also decided to
consistently promote the tasks that require legal binding power,
including tasks to reflect the basic framework and spirit of the
defense reform.
On December 2, 2005, a draft for the “Basic Laws of National
Defense Reform”was presented to the National Assembly with the
President’s approval. On December 1, 2006, the “National Defense
Reform Act”was passed in the National Assembly after going
through legal procedures such as public hearings.
Part 1 includes general provisions (purpose of the law, basic
tenets, definition of terms, basic duties of the government, etc).
Part 2 concerns the implementation of the defense reform and
includes organization and operation of the Defense Reform


☞ Refer to Appendix 6 :
“Key Contents of the National
Defense Reform Act.”

Committee.
Part 3 prescribes about advanced national defense management
systems including the expansion of civilian-based national defense
and the development of defense manpower operational structure.
Part 4 specifies reforms in force structure, balanced development
of combat capabilities, and reorganization of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
and the MND-related agencies.
Finally, Part 5 stipulates how to promote and develop a new
barrack culture including modernization of the military service
system, and military environment that will ensure human rights in
the military and provide conditions for executing military missions.

6. Pursuit of the Defense Reform, 2005-2006

To push forward the Defense Reform 2020 in earnest, the MND
formally drafted a “comprehensive plan for military structure
reform”through the “Preparation Team for Military Structure
Reform”established on December 1, 2005, along with taking
measures for legislation. Through such efforts to build an
independent defense planning capability and operational execution
systems, the phase one reform of the ROK JCS was completed in
January 2006.
The MND reviewed and confirmed priority items necessary for
military structure reform, including unit operation concepts and
deployment methods, the disintegration and wartime reorganization
of mobilization divisions, the phased reorganization of the Rear
Area Operations Command, and related force requirements.
On January 1, 2006, the MND also identified reform tasks by
inaugurating the “Preparation Team for Defense Management
Innovation.” The MND expanded civilian-based defense
manpower by establishing a “Detailed Plan to Implement the
Defense Management Innovation,”and enhanced the rationality of
force operational systems by launching the Defense Acquisition
and Procurement Agency (DAPA).
Furthermore, in order to seek efficiency of defense
management, the MND is legislating the “ Law on the
Establishment and Operation of Military-run Organizations”to


-----

Section 3. Defense Reform to Build an Advanced, Elite, and Strong Force

facilitate outsourcing in the combat service support area. The
MND is implementing measures to improve the barrack culture by
shaping environments favorable for enlisted soldiers’selfdevelopment, modernizing military barracks, and enacting the
“Basic Law of Military Service.”
In order to accelerate the defense reform, the MND has been
actively implementing the defense reform plans, through the
“Defense Reform Implementation Team”(effective Octover 9,
2006), which was organized by combining the “Preparation Team
for Military Structure Reorganization”and the “Preparation Team
for Defense Management Innovation.”

The ROK military has to maintain an omni-directional military readiness
posture bracing for any possible armed provocation to support peaceful
reunification and protect our country from external military threats and
attacks from outside.

The ROK military is thoroughly maintaining and promoting military
readiness to defend against North Korea’s all-out attack or infiltration and
provocation by making the ROK military advanced forces and by
strengthening mental readiness of soldiers and enhancing their rapid
response posture under the ROK-US combined defense system.

1. Military Organization and Force Capability

A. Strengthening the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS)

The Joint Chiefs of Staff consists of four Central Directorates
and two Assistant Chiefs of Staff and the organization of the JCS is
shown in Figure 3-1. It conducts joint and combined operations by
commanding joint military units established for joint operations, in
addition to commanding and supervising operation units including
operations command of each military service.

-----

Section 1. Maintenance of an Omnidirectional Military Readiness

As a reform measure for the force structure, the JCS
strengthened inter-operability among services and reorganized
itself for independent defense planning and military operations.
As the first stage, the ROK military in 2006 reinforced its
essential organiation centered on information and operations. As
the second stage, it is scheduled to push for reforms in connection
with the results of the ROK-US command relationship study (CRS),
triggerd by the transfer of wartime operational control.
The primary challenge for defense reform is “reinforcing
jointness”under the changing strategic environment and the nature
of future warfare. To this end, the ROK military is establishing a
joint combat development system by linking the concepts of
jointness, its experiment, and combat promotion. It has established
the concepts of operating joint forces to prepare for future warfare
by publishing The Concepts of Jointness.
The ROK military is scheduled to develop its own joint
combat development system through various efforts. These
efforts include the development of each unit’s combat method,
the creation of force requirements using the concepts of a NetCentric Warfare (NCW) by echelon, the revision of the joint
military education system, the developmenp of a joint doctrine,
the introduction of a joint specialty system, the operation of a
committee on jointness, and the reorganization of the Joint Staff
College into an exclusive institute for reinforcing jointness.

B. Force Capability of Individual Services

(1) Army

The ROK Army consists of the Army Headquarters, three Army
Commands, the Capital Defense Command, the Special Warfare
Command, the Army Aviation Operations Command, the Missile
Command, and their support units. Major organization and force
capability are as follows in Figure 3-2.
The First and Third Armies perform the mission of defending
the region that spans from the Military Demarcation Line (MDL) to

entire rear area not covered by the First and Third Armies. The
Capital Defense Command carries out the mission of defending the
Greater Seoul Metropolitan Area including providing support to
maintain the functioning of the capital and protecting its major
facilities. The tasks of the Special Warfare Command are to collect
information, locate enemy targets and carry out other designated
special missions. The Army Aviation Operations Command
provides maneuvering forces with firepower, airlift and
reconnaissance support by operating various types of helicopters.
In September 2006, the ROK military established the Missile
Command to enhance its precision strike capability.
The ROK Army will shift its current manpower-intensive force
structure into a technology-intensive one by (1) improving its
mobility, strike capability, survivability, and precision through the
acquisition of state-of-the-art weapons systems rather than reducing
the number of soldiers and units; and (2) making it a scientific,
integral force so that it can effectively execute offensive
maneuvering operations on the ground.

(2) Navy

The ROK Navy is comprised of the Navy Headquarters, Operations
Command, Marine Corps Command, and support units. The status of
its organization and major equipment is presented in Figure 3-3.

The Operations Command controls maritime operations across
the board and utilizes various vessels and aircraft to conduct
major naval component operations such as submarine warfare,
anti-submarine warfare, mine operations, landing operations,
salvage operations, and special operations. Each fleet command
possesses combat vessels such as destroyers, frigates, corvettes
and patrol crafts to defend its operational zone of responsibility.
The Marine Corps Command performs the primary duty of
conducting landing operation on the enemy’s flank and rear
areas. It also carries out such missions as forcing the dispersion of
enemy forces on the coasts of the East and West Sea, and
safeguarding the security of the west side of Seoul and
northwestern islands.
The ROK Navy is planning to shift its structure to carry out
three dimensional naval force operations including surface,
underwater, and air by creating a submarine command and an
aviation command, in addition to creating maneuvering fleets to
enhance the capability to control near sea.
To that end, the ROK will equip its navy with a state-of-the-art
defense system by building Aegis-class destroyers, next-generation

weapons. In addition, the ROK Air Force plans to establish a
Northern Combat Command to implement its mission for the
Northern area of responsibility.

C. Employment of USFK and Augmentation Forces

(1) Status of the United States Forces Korea


The United States Forces Korea (USFK), stationed in the ROK in
accordance with the “ROK-US Mutual Defense Treaty,”plays a
pivotal role and function in deterring war on the Korean peninsula
and contributes to peace and stability in the Northeast Asian region.
The Commander of the USFK also serves as the Commander of
the UNC/CFC. Under the control of the Commander of the USFK
are the 8th US Army, US Naval Forces Korea, US Air Forces Korea,
US Marine Forces Korea, and the US Special Operations Command
Korea. Figure 3-5 shows the organization and major combat
capability of the USFK.

The USFK controls two divisions and two aviation brigades as a
major combat deterrent capacity including Abraham tanks, Bradley
armored vehicles, 155mm self-propelled howitzers, multiple rocket
launch systems, AH-64 helicopters as well as a wide range of
surface-to-air missiles such as the Patriot.
As part of the Global Defense Posture Review (GPR), the US and
the ROK agreed to reduce the manpower of the USFK by 12,500 troops
in three stages by 2008. In order to complement such reduction in
manpower, the USFK has invested US＄11 billion to enhance its force
capabilities.

(2) Augmentation Forces


US augmentation forces, including the Army, Navy, Air Force
and Marine Corps, are comprised of approximately 690,000 troops,
160 naval vessels and 2,000 aircraft. These forces will be deployed
in the event of a contingency to defend the ROK.
Deployment of the augmentation forces in the event of a crisis
on the Korean Peninsula will be based on the “Time-Phased Forces
Deployment Data (TPFDD),”which primarily encompasses “Flexible
Deterrence Options (FDOs)”and “Force Module Packages (FMPs).”
FDOs, consisting of approximately 130 deterrence options, refer
to diplomatic, intelligence, economic, and military options to be
implemented when war is imminent. FMPs are those measures that
augment major combat and support units requiring the most urgent
support in the early phases of war,
should war deterrence efforts through
FDOs fail. FMPs include such major
components as rapid deployment aircraft
and carrier battle groups.

potential threats in the future. Especially in connection with North
Korea’s nuclear development, the ROK Armed Forces make it their
basic policy to respond under the ROK-US alliance, and they are
developing concrete plans of enhancing their independent response
capabilities.

A. Maintenance of Early Warning and Establishment
of Crisis Management Systems

The ROK military operates on an early warning and 24-hour
aerial surveillance system by using the ROK-US combined crisis
management and cooperation system and by monitoring the sea
and airspace around the Korean Peninsula including North Korea.
Also, it is constructing a framework of information circulation
on a real time basis in order to identify upcoming threat factors by
analyzing the movements of North Korean forces and other threat
elements.
Assuming various types of crisis situations in the Korean
Peninsula, the ROK military has prepared a manual for responding
to each crisis circumstance. The crisis management entities
comprising the ROK Ministry of National Defense (MND) and Joint
Chiefs of Staff (JCS) constantly pursue the alignment of their
command post automation systems and the improvement of their
functionality in order to ensure rapid discernment of relevant
circumstances and the execution of effective measures by sharing
information in an early stage. The ROK military has taken joint
measures to crisis from the initial stage by establishing the ROK-US
allied crisis management system. Since, it is necessary to integrate a
variety of information, to decide speedily, and to take measures
within a short period of time under crisis situations, the ROK
military is developing the peacetime ROK-US consultation body
and supplementing the crisis management system through regular
ROK-US combined crisis management exercises.
In addition, they have constantly improved their crisis
management capabilities through regular exercises and special
training programs, based on the development of concrete
procedures to deal with each type of conceivable crisis.

Especially, the dramatic improvement of functionality with the
rapid development of IT skills has enhanced the capability of the
ROK-US command post automation system.

B. Readiness Posture against Infiltrations
and Local Provocations


In spite of increased exchanges between the two Koreas, North
Korea has repeated its provocations into the South, as evidenced
by infiltration of the Northern Limit Line (NLL), shootings on a
South Korean GP, multiple violation of the borderline, and the
West Sea skirmish in 2002.

Under such circumstances, the ROK Armed Forces have
maintained a 24-hour surveillance and monitoring posture on all
North Korean military movements and potential infiltrators. At the
same time, they have conducted vigilant patrol activities by using
naval vessels, submarines and aircraft on the seas under their
jurisdiction including the five major Northwestern
Islands, Mara-do, Ulleung-do and Dok-do Islands.
In particular, to be fully prepared against the
possibility of any intentional armed provocation in the
northwestern sea, the ROK military has been
reinforcing the state of its combat readiness by
providing detailed rules of engagement.
On the other hand, the ROK military has
promoted the use of communication systems - Scene of coast guarding mission
between North and South Korean naval vessels according to the
agreement of the North-South general-level talks in 2004, in order
to prevent accidental military clashes.
Moreover, the ROK military has drastically enhanced
the “ quality” of guarding posture with scientific
surveillance equipment replacing the existing manpowercentered guarding system in the DMZ and other vulnerable
areas. The ROK military is keeping a tight defense posture
on a real time basis bracing for various incidents which can
happen in the inter-Korean administrative zone along the
inter-Korean roads and railways. - Scene of F- 16's patrolling mission

C. Readiness Posture Against an All-out War

The ROK-US allied forces maintain a combat readiness posture
on a real time basis against North Korea’s military provocations and
put an all-out effort to deter any such provocation. Moreover, they
are ready to deter the enemy’s surprise attacks with an early
warning system which can cover the Korean Peninsula and
provide swift response measures.
The ROK military has already established readiness posture to
dominate the battlefield, should the North launch a war, by

denying the enemy’s rapid attack, and launching precision strikes
against North Korea’s long-range missiles and artillery. By doing
so, the ROK military can secure the safety of the metropolitan area.
The ROK military has reinforced its capability to fight by
conducting periodical joint and combined military exercises
simulating a real war. Moreover, the ROK military is promoting
new concepts such as NCW (Network Centric Warfare), IO
(Information Operations), EBO (Effects-Based Operations) by
formulating a military doctrine to mobilize the Army, Navy, Air
forces and Marine Corps jointly and simultaneously, not to mention
enhancing interoperability and capability to perform ROK-US
combined operations.
At the same time, the ROK military is gradually setting up an
advanced C4ISR-PGM system, to see first, decide first, and strike first.

Section 1. Maintenance of an Omnidirectional Military Readiness

3. Maintenance of a Rapid Response Posture

The ROK military maintains a rapid response posture and use
personnel and resources that are necessary for staging a war.

A. Manpower Mobilization


Manpower mobilization refers to, in the event of a war or a
contingency or a quasi-national emergency, recruiting troops,
securing the support personnel necessary for military operations,
and recruiting additional personnel to keep the functions of the
government in order and perform the missions of key industrial
firms designated for wartime mobilization. Manpower mobilization
is divided into troop mobilization, wartime labor service
mobilization, and technician mobilization.
Troop mobilization refers to expanding (augmenting or
activating) military units and mobilizing troops to make up for the
lives lost in times of a war, contingency, or mobilization, and to
use them as combat troops. A critical element accounting for most
of manpower mobilization, troop mobilization aims at designating
and managing elite reservists to secure efficiency of wartime
mobilization of forces, at zoning and controlling the areas for
reservists to resport for a timely mobilization, and at continuously
improving mobilization and convoy systems.
Wartime labor service mobilization refers mobilizing people for
manual work including repairing damages and transporting
supplies and ammunitions to assist military operations. For a more
efficient implementation of missions for these laborers, the
government readjusted the candidates for wartime labor service
mobilization from those who belong to the “People’s Secondary
Military Service”to those reservists who belong to civil defense
corps.
Technician mobilization involves mobilizing people with
certain technical qualifications for equipment operation or
maintenance, the government continues to select technicians
skilled in current and new technologies.


Designated Agency:
An industrial company that is
informed by the government to
undertake a mission as part of
the wartime mobilization plan


6


-----

B. Materiel Mobilization

The objective of materiel mobilization is to back up military
operations and ensure sustainability by mobilizing such resources
as commodities, equipment, facilities and entities held by the
civilian sector and government at the right time and place.
Industrial mobilization refers to mobilization of items required
by the military in the form of food, clothing, oil, fortification
materials, etc., from production and maintenance companies,
public relations media, hospitals and so forth.
Transportation mobilization means “mobilization for use”or
“management on control”of such transport equipment as
automobiles, ships and airplanes as well as maintenance, transport
and loading/unloading service providers which the ROK military
needs in the event of a contingency. For timely mobilization, the
ROK military has adopted improved mobilization methods
including mobilization of substitute vehicles to cover partial
shortage of vehicles and expansion of the scope of potential
substitute vehicles by type in areas with insufficient resources.
Construction mobilization refers to “mobilization for use”or
“management on control”of buildings, land, construction machinery,
construction equipment maintenance service providers and
construction companies that are required by the ROK military. In
order to shorten the time spent for mobilization, the military has
improved the current mobilization system, authorizing replacement of
any deficient equipment in a city or province with similar equipment.
Communication mobilization means “mobilization for use”or
“management on control”of ordinary (domestic and international)
communication/satellite communication lines and IT service providers.
It aims at ensuring successful military operations by providing swift
support to military communication networks during war.

4. Strengthening Soldiers’Spiritual Power

The ROK military has to reinforce the spiritual power of soldiers
to ensure victory and to establish a firm perspective on our country


Mobilization for Use:
a certain period of time to be
restored to the original owner
upon termination of
mobilization; applicable to
equipment mobilization.

Management on
Control:
Controlling the steps of
production, repair,
processing and
distribution to attain the
purposes of mobilization,
with autonomy of relevant
companies guaranteed in
non-controlled areas;
applicable to company
mobilization, etc.


-----

Section 1. Maintenance of an Omnidirectional Military Readiness

and national security for the accomplishment of its missions. The
reinforcement of the spiritual power of the soldiers is very important in
enhancing invisible combat capability. And it is essential for promoting
military capability as it is for developing combat techniques.
Accordingly, the MND is placing a high priority on cultivating
soldiers’spiritual power to “establish a firm defense posture”by
training elite soldiers who can know and practice exactly what to
protect (the view on the nation), who is our enemy (the view on
security), and how to protect (soldier spirit).

A. Focuses and Meanings

The ROK military has to protect its territory and
sovereignty, the ideology of liberal democracy and
system, the lives of people and property, and our
traditional culture and history. To that end, setting up
a right perspective of the nation is essential.
It is clear from whom we have to defend. We
have to protect our country from those who
threaten, assist or support the threateners of our
national interest which includes our national
existence, security, and national sovereignty, etc. To - Fostering the military spirit through

physical training

consolidate the attitude involves establishing a sound
perspective on national security.
A soldier is one who can willingly give up his life for his
country when it is in danger. The soldier’s spirit is a crucial factor
that determines a win or loss in war, and a standard as well as an
index of the soldier’s thoughts and actions.

B. How to Realize

Spiritual cultivation for soldiers is implemented at military
schools and military units. Officers in charge have to be endowed
with the ability to teach spiritual education in the classroom and
they have to educate newly arrived soldiers by putting an emphasis
on “soldier making”so they can easily adapt to the barrack life by
understanding the military’s mission and its peculiarity.


6


-----

Spiritual education at units is implemented in regular curricula
and in the barrack life so that soldiers who are assigned to their
units can practice and internalize the “soldier values”after finishing
their military school education and recruit training.
Specifically, the MND is enhancing the quality of spiritual education
by applying various spiritual education methods, such as inviting
civilian experts, lecturing tours of the Korea National Defense
University’s spiritual education support unit, etc.
The MND is providing directions to the soldiers’spiritual
education to proceed with unity and consistency and it gives contents
adequate to adapting to changes in environment when necessary.
Also, the MND not only provides periodicals for the soldier’s
emotional stability and the instructor’s reference books but it also
distributes basic textbooks on spiritual education in order to enhance
educational effectiveness.
The MND is developing various spiritual education programs and
textbooks to provide actual practice and internalization for soldiers
in consideration of the changed environment
and their personality.
And it also has constructed a simultaneous
education system on satellite TV for military use
in order to enhance the quality and system of
cyber spiritual education to meet the needs of
the information and science era.

Section 2. Establishment Integrated Civil Governmental Military Defense Posture

As shown by the 1/ 21 incident in 1968, the Gangneng submarine
infiltration attempt in 1996, the Yeonpyeong Sea Battle in 1999, repeated
violations of the Northern Limit Line (NLL) and shootings against South
Korean guard posts, North Korea has constantly perpetrated acts of
provocation against South Korea. Meanwhile, North Korea possesses
120,000-men special forces in the name of the “military-first policy”; it
has military capabilities to invade into South Korea at any time.

Besides the fear of military threats, non-military threats such as terror
and natural disasters are increasing in number. Therefore, it is necessary
to establish an integrated defense posture in which all national powers
available are integrated.

1. Integrated Defense System

The integrated Defense Headquarters is headed by the
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Its main missions are to
formulate and coordinate policies for integrated defense, to
ascertain and supervise the integrated defense posture, to conduct
general analyses of the situations of integrated defense operations
and present counter-measures, to provide directions for operations
and training for integrated defense, and to
coordinate and control their execution.
The Central Integrated Defense Committee
is the top decision-making organization in
connection with integrated defense, which
belongs to the Office of the Prime Minister. It
deliberates and votes on national integrated
defense policy, directions for operations and
training for integrated defense, and the

training integrated defense operations. Furthermore, it runs an
integrated defense situation room, nurtures and supports the
national defense elements, and monitors residential reporting
systems in remote areas.

2. Integrated Defense Operation Posture


The Integrated Defense System by chiefs of local governments
was constructed for setting up a regional security posture because
of the increased necessity for its role and function over regional
security issues since the local government system was introduced
in 1995.
In the case of the enemy’s infiltration or provocation, the
provincial governors or city mayors as the chiefs of the Regional
Integrated Defense Committee, declare an integrated defense
incident, and support any military operation by establishing
integrated defense support headquarters, implementing integrated
defense operations by combining all national defense elements by
nominating the corresponding region’s director of local police
agency or local military commander as a commander.
The MND is putting its priority on setting up and upgrading the
system to respond immediately and create a synergy effect by
integrating its functionality and each military unit’s effort under the
local government chief’s direction and cooperation which is
stipulated by integrated defense regulations so as to construct a
perfect regional integrated defense posture in the civil,
governmental and military defense circles.
Moreover, in the case of the enemy’s infiltration, provocation,
disaster, or accident, the MND is putting its effort to effectly run a
situation room for integrated defense by building an integrated
communication system, combining all the operational factors of the
civil, governmental and military for effective command and control.
The Integrated Defense General Situation Room is equipped
with the LAN and CCTV among functional departments in the HQ
as well as the WAN and two-way broadcasting systems in the
provincial or metropolitan situation rooms to share information
suitable to the IT generation.

The MND is enforcing a system which
enables integrated measures centering
around the chiefs of local governments by
supporting an on-line system on a real
time basis.
To protect critical national facilities,
the MND is strengthening watch and
surveillance equipment as well as
implementing a self-protection plan for

- Instructing visit for protection over the important each facility. The ROK military and police

are enforcing related exercises and

- Instructing visit for protection over the important

developing integrated protecting plans over the whole area of
critical national facilities.
Especially in 2006, it complemented concrete means to control
and evaluate the exercises, the substance and time of the drill in
order to enhance the contents and qualities of the practice by
putting emphasis on the improvement of integrated defense
training.

3. Homeland Defense Operation Posture

Homeland defense operations are integrated civiliangovernment-military operations conducted by mobilizing the
Reserve Forces with a view to eliminating enemy infiltrations in
certain areas at the earliest possible time and to guard critical
facilities and logistical supply lines, both in times of peace and
war.
The Reserve Forces pursue a step-by-step modernization of
combat equipment and complementation of homeland defense
supplies to enhance homeland defense operation capabilities in
peace and war times. In addition, the “Regulations on Nurturing
and Supporting of the Homeland Reserve Forces”was enacted and
enforced to lay out an institutional basis that ensures appropriate
support for homeland defense operations. The Rules provide for
the responsibilities and details of support by each entity fostering
the Reserve Forces, formulation of systematic nurturing plans and
the procedures of handling relevant affairs.

C. The Taegeuk Exercise


The Taegeuk Exercise is a command post exercise to brace for
possible war by promoting the JCS’s capability of independent
defense planning and the executing of military operations in order
to identify requirements for system development and combat
capability through war gaming.
The exercise was initiated to form a working-level exercise in
1995 at the request of the JCS to enhance its independent capability
in the wake of the transfer of peacetime operational control in
1994. And since 1996, it has been developed as the JCS’s general
command post exercise by expanding its participation to
operations command and naming it as the “Aprok River Exercise.”
It has been developed as the ROK military's independent
military drill by changing its name to the “Taegeuk Exercise”in
2004. It is especially developing the exercise by applying the
“Taegeuk JOS Model”which was developed by the JCS in 2005.
The JCS is promoting joint military operations, counterfire
operations, deep operations, effects-based operations, and the
system of stabilization operations by enhancing
jointness and combat-oriented thinking as well as
mastering wartime mission and procedure of
functional performance.

D. The Hoguk Exercise

Conducted annually under the supervision of the
ROK JCS since Nov. 1996, the Hoguk Exercise is an
independent large-scale field maneuver exercise
aimed at improving ability to master large-scale units
procedure for operational plans as well as enhancing
ability to conduct joint operations and integrated war
fighting capability. The exercise is making it possible
to train against a possible all-out war along the coastal
and inland axes of movement.
Through the Hoguk Exercise, the ROK Armed
Forces not only develop the concept of carrying out

equipment. By doing so, the MND is developing an operational
level concept of the ROK military’s combined operations.

E. The Hwarang Exercise

All civilian, governmental, and military operational components
take part in the Hwarang Exercise that is
conducted under the supervision of the
Integrated Defense Headquarters. It is an
expanded and upgraded form of the
comprehensive training against infiltration into
the Greater Seoul Metropolitan Area carried out
from 1977 to 1981 under the control of the
Third Army Command in order to increase its
integrated defense capabilities in remote areas
of the peninsula.
The Exercise is conducted in five regions. - Decontamination training on the road
However, in odd years, it is conducted in three
regions consisting of Seoul, Incheon and Gyeonggi, and Busan,
Ulsan, Gyeongnam Province, Daegu and Gyeongbuk Province. In
the even years, it is conducted in two regions consisting of
Daejeon, Chungcheong, Gwangju, Jeolla, Jeju and Gangwon.
The Hwarang Excercise is conducted focusing on three things:
to enhance wartime/peacetime operational plan execution
capabilities, to enhance security awareness of the residents, and to

various training programs including combat command training,
advanced combat training, and simulation training. Based on such
efforts, the Army is drastically improving the practical effects of its
education and training by allowing officers and soldiers to
indirectly experience battle field situations.
The Battle Command Training Program (BCTP) nurtures the BCTP:
combat command capabilities of commanders and staff at the levels Battle Command Training Program
of corps, divisions, regiments and battalions, based on the
application of the independently developed “Changjo 24 Model”
and “Hwarang 21 Model.”
The BCTP emphasizes mastering unit command procedures,
strengthening the operational capabilities of integrated combat
force, and assessing battle field experiences and regulations
related to field operations.
Advanced combat training is a two-way free maneuver
exercise utilizing “opposing forces.”Based on the use of
actual armed forces and equipment at the Korean Army

Maritime maneuver exercise is the training that entails offensive
maneuvers designed to neutralize the enemy’s naval force as soon as
possible and secure control of the sea in the event of a contingency.
Three-dimensional exercises involving the newest surface
combatants, submarines, maritime aircraft and maritime operation
helicopters are conducted more than 10 times a year on average.
Combined exercise participated by the ROK Navy is broken
down into the ROK-US combined exercise to bolster combined
defense capabilities and multinational combined exercise to
promote military cooperation with foreign countries.
The ROK-US combined exercise ranges from counter special
operation force exercise, anti-submarine maritime search,
submarine, mine warfare, rescue, landing, and special warfare
operations.
In addition, the ROK-Japan and ROK-Russia combined search &
rescue operations are carried out. Moreover, the ROK Navy takes
part in the RIMPAC (Rim of the Pacific) exercise, a multinational
combined training exercise. It is a good chance for the ROK Navy
to strengthen its combined military capability by exchanges and
cooperation with 10 countries including the US, Japan, Russia,
Canada, Australia, New Zealand, France and Britain.
Component exercise is implemented annually for strengthening
combat capability for various missions specific to the Navy including
anti-submarine warfare, mine warfare, amphibious warfare, rescue
and search, special warfare and submarine exercises.
Implemented all around world, the Naval Academy
midshipmen’s cruise training spans 100 to 150 days each year. Its
purpose is to enhance the midshipmen’s job
performance capabilities as prospective officers
and raise the ROK’s international stature through
goodwill visits to friendly nations.

support to the Army and Navy, etc.
Defensive counter-air training aims to block the enemy’s
infiltration into the nation’s airspace. The training utilizes simulated
enemy aircraft which employs enemy infiltration tactics, in order to
detect, identify, intercept and destroy, from a long distance, any
enemy aircraft intruding by air, with the participation of
interceptors and air defense artillery units.
Offensive counter-air training aims to win air supremacy over
the enemy’s area by using air power.
Air interdiction training is designed to restrain the enemy’s
combat capability, supply, and mobility by destroying or delaying
enemy’s potential military capability before its effective use against
our Army and Navy.
The training includes the ROK Air Forces’s independent or
Combined Large Force Exercise (CLFE) and ground-to-ground deep
strike training against tactical targets. To enhance the ability to
respond to critical targets on a real time basis, the Air Force
conducts emergency air interdiction training.
For the purpose of supporting ground and naval forces, close
air support training is carried out through the use of fighters, nightvision goggles, IR pointer that enables all-weather precision
attacks. Daytime/nighttime close air support and anti-ship attack
training is conducted against simulated targets on the ground and
in the sea. In addition, joint actual bombing, nighttime bombing
and precision-guided weapons trainings are implemented to
enhance practical attack capabilities.
The ROK military is executing counter-fire exercises through its
HQ to respond to North Korea’s 170mm, 240mm,

Section 4. Training Reserve Forces as Key Combat Units

Advanced countries today are applying considerable weight to their
reserve forces in order to utilize national defense resources while taking
advantage of their standing forces as an essential military force.

A future war in the Korean Peninsula is expected to use all the national
resources; therefore, an effective use of the reserve forces will be an
important factor, which will determine the final consequence of war.

Accordingly, the ROK military is putting its emphasis on high-level
training of the reserve forces through the reserve forces management and
development of educational training. At the same time, while enhancing
the capability of homeland defense operations and setting up an effective
war-time mobilization posture to acquire well-trained reserve forces. This
is connected to the directions of regular forces, given the limited national
resources and mobilization environment.

1. Organization of the Reserve Forces
and Resource Management

A. Organization of the Reserve Forces

The reserve forces are divided into homeland reserve forces
and mobilized reserve forces by their missions. The homeland
reserve forces accomplish their missions in their areas of
responsibility and the mobilized reserve forces execute equivalent
combat missions to the regular army by calling up new military
units in wartime or supplementing soldiers when necessary.
Currently the reserve forces number approximately 3,000,000
and they consist of regional reserve forces and work-place reserve
forces.
The reserve forces are composed of ex-officers, warrant officers

or non-commissioned officers until their retirement age in
accordance with the Military Personnel Law. Those who are
discharged from the regular and reservist units can be called up for
eight years of reserve force duty after finishing their military
service.

The organization of the reserve forces is shown in Figure 3-7.

The size of the Reserve Forces may be adjusted in connection
with the regular forces by the year 2020. At the same time, the
MND will cut down the service period of the reserve forces from
eight to five years, after upgrading its combat capability to carry
out military operations with the regular military forces in wartime.

B. Reserve Force Resource Management

Homeland reserve units, which play a central role in managing
reserve resources in relevant areas and conducting homeland
defense operations, are organized into units at the level of the
administrative districts of eup, myeon and dong across the country.
At the level of si (city), gun (county) and gu (ward), separate
mobile units remain in operation.
Workforce reserve units range from brigades to squads,
depending on the size of reservist resources at relevant workplace.
Moreover, the MND is utilizing a “national mobilization
information system”which is shared among the MND, the Military


-----

Section 4. Training Reserve Forces as Key Combat Units

Manpower Administration, each Service Headquarters, and the
reserve force unit in order to execute adminstration affairs
connected with reserve force resources management and training.

2. Reserve Force Education and Training

The education and training of the ROK Reserve Forces is
conducted for the purpose of “promoting proficiency in
mobilization procedures and guaranteeing high-level combat
capabilities after mobilization”and “nurturing homeland defense
operation capabilities.”Assuring that no impediment results to
reservists’livelihood, the MND has constantly improved their
training system by introducing more sophisticated and intensive
programs so that reservists can rapidly exercise their combat
capabilities.
The MND has improved the way of notifying
reservists of their training duty by using the Internet so
that all the reservists can choose the day of training of
their own convenience. Table 3-8 shows annual
training hours for reservists by the type of training.

Moreover, the MND is applying practical training
methods which enable them to master combat action
by setting up simulated facilities of the battle ground
for reservists’training.
And the Reservists’training methods are making use
of survival equipment and Multiple Integrated Laser

and actual fighting in wartime.

- Offering location information over the By carrying out training on holidays, the MND
Reserve Forces' training camp

guarantees the opportunity for reservist trainees who
find it difficult to participate in exercises due to work
commitments, it keeps on improving the system for reservists by
offering GPS which enables them to find the training camp.

A. Mobilization Training

Mobilization training targets reservist resources in their first to
fourth year of reserve service who are subject to mobilization into
military units. On the basis of wartime missions, this training focuses
on exercises to bolster mastery of military unit expansion/creation
procedures, perform relevant duties at individual and team levels,
and execute wartime operation plans.
Among the mobilized divisions, some of them executing
quartering exercise at the operations area and those who do not
participate in the drill have to reenter the relevant military unit for
the exercise.

B. Non-Mobilization Training

Non-mobilization training targets reservists in their first to fourth
year of reserve service who are not appointees for mobilization as well
as those who failed to participate in mobilization training. It
emphasizes the enhancement of the capacity for regional defense
operations, MOS and individual tactics and combat skill and specialty
ability by executing the training under the control of one’s former
military service and specialty unit. Reservists who served in the Navy or
Air Force on active duty are also trained in the relevant military units.

Section 4. Training Reserve Forces as Key Combat Units

C. Homeland Defense Training

Homeland defense training is classified into basic homeland
defense training and homeland defense operation plan training.
Basic homeland defense training is conducted for reservists in their
fifth to sixth year of reserve service. It stresses the enhancement of
the ability to carry out homeland defense operations by selecting
tasks essential to the execution of military missions and allowing
trainees to master required tasks.
The homeland defense operation training plan targets reservists
who are not appointees for mobilization among the reserve
resources in their first to fourth year of reserve service, and
reservists in their fifth to sixth year of reserve service. It is carried
out two times a year.

Chapter Strengthening Future-oriented Defense Capabilities
4

The ROK military is increasing its quality-based defense capabilities to
ensure self-reliant defense planning and operation capability on the basis
of self-reliant war deterrence and defense-sufficient military capabilities.

The military will be equipped with surveillance and reconnaissance
capabilities, established with a C4I system to guarantee integrated
operation of efficient combat power, to secure maneuvering and
precision-guided strike capabilities, and consolidate the increasing
defense industry in addition to defense R&D.

1. The Process and Evaluation
of Military Capabilities Buildup

The ROK military, which maintained its forces by depending on
free military assistance from the US, has undertaken force
reinforcement by its own defense expenditure since 1974.
It succeeded in the domestic production of conventional
weapons which began with the copied production of basic
weapons under the name “Project Yulgok.”It achieved the
modernization of military equipment through foreign imports of
state-of-the-art weapons, and eventually reached a phase of
conducting its own domestic R&D.
While local provocation has taken place occasionally over the
past 53 years since the Korean War, the ROK Armed Forces have
deterred war on the Korean Peninsula through the use of
cooperative security, based on the ROK-US alliance, as well as by
taking efforts aimed at self-reliant defense. The ROK’s current
military capabilities have come to maintain a qualitative edge over
North Korea’s capabilities despite its quantitative inferiority.
As a result of having prepared for potential threats of the future,
the ROK military, at present, is establishing a stepping stone that
will enable it to secure advanced key military capabilities in


-----

Section 1. Buildup of an Elite Military Force


response to future warfare.

2. Objectives and Directions
of Military Capabilities Buildup

The ROK Armed Forces makes every effort to maintain a military
readiness posture which is able to cope with existing North Korea’s
and other potential military threats in the future. Enhancing “its selfreliant war deterrence capability,”in consideration of national
circumstances and limited available resources, it continues increasing
its military capabilities so as to secure “defense-sufficient military
capabilities”sufficient to combat potential military threats. The
direction to be taken for improving military capabilities is as follows.
First, the ROK military will reinforce the military capabilities
required to convert a manpower-intensive and conventional force
structure into a technology-intensive and qualitatively advanced
force structure. Second, the force structure is being developed into
an intelligence, knowledge and network-centric structure. This
increases the suitability for a warfighting concept of “surveillance,
reconnaissance-command, and control-strike.”Third, the military
will ensure the efficient operation of high-tech weapons systems by
consolidating basic force capabilities and seeking force integration
pursuant to the High-Low Mix concept. Fourth, the military will
push ahead with early attainment of independent development
capabilities for high-tech weapons systems through intensified
defense R&D in the long term.
As the nuclear threat has materialized as a result of North
Korea’s nuclear test in October 2006, the military will increase
identification and supplement emerging demands for surveillance
and reconnaissance, precision strikes, and an interception and
protection force.

3. Improvement Plan of Defense Capabilities

A. The 2006 Plan

increased by 6.7% since 2005. This includes cost of improving
defense capabilities of 7.4994 trillion won which has augmented by
16.0% since 2005. The pure improvement cost is 5.8077 trillion
won. 1.9074 trillion won in working expenses was also required
for parts and miscellaneous items. Major projects continued in 2006
and new projects are shown in Table 4-1.

B. Mid-term (2007-2011) Defense Plan

Improvement projects of various defense capabilities will be
conducted during the mid-term from 2007 to 2011, under the aim
of “reinforcing a self-reliant war deterrence capability and
establishing a basis for defense-sufficient force capabilities.”This
plan focuses on securing independent surveillance and
reconnaissance (Sensor); building up the C4I system for integrated
operation of combat power; acquiring long-range strike capabilities
and shooter to combat unspecified threats of the future; shoring up
the existing basic force; R&D for self-reliance of the technology;
and strengthening the national defense industry.
The level of surveillance and reconnaissance force aims at
securing the capabilities of independent information collection
over the Korean Peninsula and surrounding areas. The acquisition
plan for the AWACS, high-altitude unmanned reconnaissance
plane, tactical reconnaissance and information collection systems
will be executed to ensure the strategic level of surveillance and
early warning.
Regarding battlefield management systems, the MND plans to
establish a network-centric warfare infrastructure by incorporating
strategic and tactical C4I systems and military satellite
communication systems into force by 2011, which will enable all
echelons to perform real-time “surveillance, reconnaissancecommand, and control-strike.”For this, the military intends to give
priority to establishing KJCCS linked from the Joint Chiefs of Staff to
each field army operational command, and continues to upgrade its
function. It also plans to incorporate a tactical unit-level C4I system
into the force and integrate a combined processing system of
military information dealing with each field army’s and echelon’s
military information collected in linkage with combined
command/control mechanism. Furthermore, tactical communication
systems will be upgraded to next generation communication
systems. Such concepts of battlefield management system are
illustrated in Table 4-2.

its long-distance strike capability and to combat potential
threats in the future.

- F-15K The MND will ensure continued improvement of

outdated or inefficient forces in a bid to enhance the
existing basic force capabilities. To this end, the Army
intends to both reorganize one mechanized and one
armored unit respectively and incorporate K1A1 tanks into
the force, and also to secure anti-artillery detection radars.
The Navy’s new escort ships will replace the 7,000 ton
Aegis destroyer and outdated escort ships providing an

- 214-class Submarine alternative force. The Air Force will launch new projects

the force to increase its air defense and protective capabilities.

C. Direction of Mid-term (2008-2012) Defense Program

“Mid-term (2008-2012) Defense Program”will reflect the force
demands to prepare for an altered security context such as North
Korea’s nuclear test in consideration of the “Government’s Midterm (2006 - 2010) Fiscal Management Plan.”During this period, in
parallel with the stable execution of the ongoing projects, the MND
will attempt to revise and supplement the Defense Mid-term

Process of the Incorporation
of Weapons Systems
into Force Capabilities

Defense investment in response to the uncertain future warfare environment should be put forward with
consideration of at least ten years lead time for force incorporation. Thereby, the military can utilize necessary
forces as appropriate.
Thus, with respect to defense investment the MND should determine the appropriate ROC(Required
Operational Capabilities) and move forward consistently by predicting the post-ten year security environment
and economic capabilities rather than the present financial and security situation.

regarding new forces verified in terms of their validity.

4. Defense R&D and Fostering of Defense Industry

A. Development of Defense R&D Policy

Advanced countries funnel their investments for defense
budgets into the assurance of key force capability and R&D of
cutting-edge core technologies, in consideration of future
battlefield environments so as to get an edge on not only defense
science and technology but also intelligence capabilities. As shown
by past practices of the ROK’s defense acquisition, the MND has
tried to enhance its force capabilities in the short-term by
purchasing foreign weapon systems rather than by investing in
domestic R&D. Accordingly, the technological gaps between the
ROK and advanced countries were widened due to both
insufficient investment in development of domestic technologies
and avoidance of technological transfer by advanced countries.
Accordingly, the MND should establish a new foundation not only
to set the stage for mid- and long-term policies beneficial to defense
science and technology, but to embody it systematically. Toward that
end, the MND is moving to build up a self-reliant defense capacity,
competitive to that of developed nations, with the core technology
necessary for R&D of state-of-the-art weapons systems and having a
development capability for future high-tech weapons systems.

B. Status regarding R&D
of Weapon Systems

The ROK military has centralized its
investment for the improvement of core and
leading technologies in the 2000’s, the era of
innovation of defense science and technology.
As a result, it has ended the development of
high-tech weapons systems encompassing short
- UAV range surface-to-air guided weapons, anti-sonic


-----

Section 1. Buildup of an Elite Military Force


torpedo systems, reconnaissance drones for corps level
units, electronic warfare equipment for ships, KO-1 control
aircraft, ship-to-ship guided weapons, portable anti-air
guided weapons, new-model light torpedoes, real-time C4I
systems, the first T-50 supersonic training aircraft for the
ROK, externally fitted electronic jamming devices for
fighters, and sea port surveillance systems, etc.
In particular, the military has exported a basic trainer
KT-1 to Indonesia in early 2000, with further sales contracts.
Recently it was involved in export consultation with the
Philippines and Latin American countries while at the same
time conducting sales negotiations for the K-1 selfpropelled artillery which it exported to Turkey in 2000.

C. Establishing the Foundation
of Domestic Defense Industry



- KO-1 Tactical Controller


As a consequence of that the ROK government stepped up
the infrastructure of the defense industry. 1,405 firms registered
as of the end of 2005, are currently producing defense industry
related materials, and are accomplishing remarkable growth - Ship-to-Ship Guided Weapons
making Korea the 12th ranking or highest production/exporting
country of supersonic aircraft in the world. The ROK is reaching a new
turning point in the improvement of
defense capability, procurement of
logistic goods and the buildup of the
defense industry with the enactment of
“the Defense Business Act of 2006.”
Despite continued growth in the
defense industry, the operation rate of
defense industry companies remains
at comparatively low levels compared
to the manufacturing sectors as
indicated in Table 4-3.

※Source : 2006 management analysis of defense industry complex (the Korea Defense Industry Association, Nov. 2006)


In this context, the MND will move forward to improve “the
institution of specialization & grouping”for the sake of elevating
the competitiveness of defense industrial firms, and to step up the
defense industrial infrastructure through the reasonable operation
of defense industrial materials and the system designating specific
firms. As this system is one for stable procurement and quality
control of military-exclusive equipment and materiel which are
difficult to be obtained when market economy principles are
applied, the MND plans to develop the system to nurture
companies producing major goods, such as strategic materials,
even after the abolishment of the above system.
Furthermore, the MND is moving ahead with cutting back
indirect expenses on exporting goods through the exemption of
the rental fee for technologies that the government retains to
enhance export competitiveness.
Hereafter, the MND will continue to create demand for the
defense industry along with the expansion of investment for
defense R&D, and smoothen the enforcement of the planned
investment. Along with decision making reflecting both the
technological and production capacity of the domestic defense
industry, it will expedite systematic defense industrial policy such
as the continuous improvement of the system reflecting the
opinions of the Armed Forces and the defense industrial complex.
At the same time, on the basis of survey and analysis regarding
defense industrial infrastructure, the MND plans to encourage firms
having the same or similar kinds of businesses to streamline
facilities voluntarily in the mid- and long term perspective. It also

plans to enhance the structural competitiveness of the
defense industrial sectors through highly experienced
R&D and production personnel-centered reorganization
of the defense industry areas.


D. Expansion of International Cooperation
in Regard to Defense Industry



- K-200 ROK-made Armored Vehicle


International defense industry cooperation ought to be
intensified to strengthen the export support of Koreanmade defense industry goods, and guarantee stable
operation of introduced weaponry as well as the import - Light Torpedo
of advanced technologies from abroad. To this end, the MND has
concluded defense industry cooperation agreements with 24
countries and accordingly expanded exchanging countries
including Europe, South America and Asia. In addition, it has
entered into agreements with them on quality assurance, exchange
of price information, and exchange of technical data in order to
guarantee the long term and stable operation of imported
weaponry.
By holding joint committee meetings regularly on defense
industry cooperation with those nations which concluded defense
industry cooperation agreements with the ROK, the MND carries
out a support role for exporting domestic defense products, and
executing international joint cooperative business. It also
introduces advanced technology and makes consultations to enable
smooth logistics support of foreign import
equipment. Furthermore, it endeavors to seek
new markets for defense industry export in South
America, Asia and the Middle East countries.
Being aware that the broadening of defense
industry export is essential to maintain the
complexity of the domestic defense industry, the
MND focuses its military diplomatic capability on
the expansion of defense industry export by
making up military diplomacy guidelines and

industry export. To achieve this goal, while consolidating on-thespot export support activities by defense attaches and establishing
support systems government-wide for defense industry exports, the
MND plans to reinforce the organization bearing exclusive charge
of its export by augmenting export support manpower.

Section 2. Development of the Future-oriented ROK-US Alliance

The ROK-US alliance has been playing a pivotal role to maintain peace
and stability of the Korean Peninsula on the basis of mutual respect and
common values such as liberal democracy and market economy that the
two allies have built over half a century. In the mean time, the ROK-US
alliance faces a new era of transformation in accordance with radical
changes in internal and external security environments, post 9/11 attack
and the ROK’s increasing national power.


Holding the SPI (Security Policy Initiative) meetings since 2005, the two
nations exert all efforts to set up a road map of the future ROK-US
alliance in addition to monitoring follow-up measures of the USFK
rearrangement.

Hence, the ROK-US alliance will be driven to “comprehensive,
dynamic and mutually beneficial alliance relations”encompassing various
fields such as politics, economy, society and culture, as well as the
military, which contributes to the maintenance of peace and stability in
both the Korean Peninsula and Northeast Asia.

1. Realignment of the ROK-US Alliance

A. Background

The ROK-US alliance is now undergoing a process of futureoriented alignment and development according to changes in the
security environment such as the progress of inter-Korean
relations and changes in US security and military strategies toward
uncertain security threats.
The US is pursuing changes from a threat-based to a
capability-based strategy in order to respond to trans-national and
non-military threats that have newly emerged since the September
11 terrorist attacks.
To realize concepts of such a military strategy, the US is

pursuing not only a high-tech, mobile and
light military capability, but also a
realignment of its military bases stationed
all over the world.
The GPR focuses, in principle, on the
expansion of allied and friendly nations’
role. The ROK military is also requested to
expand its role sharing according to an
increase in defense capability.
From the Korean point of view,
growing has been the national demand

- ROK-US Summit (Sept. 2006), Washinton, D.C. that Korea seeks for mutually beneficial,

cooperative and mature allied relations with the US on the basis of
its increased national power derived from economic growth.

B. Relocaton of the USFK


A relocation project for the Yongsan Garrison has been
discussed since March 1988, not only to meet the national desire
for the transfer of foreign troops stationed in the center of Seoul
but also to provide the conditions for the stable stationing of the
USFK in conjunction with a balanced development of the land, and
the strengthening of the ROK-US alliance.
This project was, in fact, suspended due to the excessive cost of
the relocation in 1993. The necessity for the resumption of this
project, however, was proposed with the construction of USFK
apartments in Yongsan Army Garrison, December 2001. Thereafter,
the two sides reached an agreement on the principle of an early
transfer of the garrison at the ROK-US summit in May 2005, and
since then close negotiations have been in progress.
As a result of the negotiation, the ROK-US agreed to transfer the
Yongsan Garrison involving UNC/CFC to the Pyeongtaek area with
a target date of the end of 2008. This relocation project began by
concluding the Yongsan garrison transition agreement (UA/IA)
together with the ratification of the National Assembly in December
2004. Due to the time needed to secure the site because of the
residents’opposition, evaluation of the environmental impact,
and additionally the negotiation of cost sharing between the


UA (Umbrella Agreement):
This document takes the form
of a treaty outlining the
principles, sites and costs of
the Yongsan Garrison
relocation. It consists of a
preamble and 8 articles.

IA (Implementing
Agreement):
This document is also in the
form of a treaty stipulating
details necessary to the
implementation of the
Yongsan Garrison relocation
plan. It consists of a preamble
and 7 articles.

Section 2. Development of the Future-oriented ROK-US Alliance

ROK and the US, the deadline for the transfer will be determined
on the basis of ROK-US consultation.
The relocation of the US 2nd infantry division is a project to
integrate subordinate units of the division which perform their
missions in several places located in the northern area of Kyunggi
province and aims at the balanced development of national land,
the solution of local residents’inconveniences, and a US plan for
relocation.
In the 1st stage, the USFK will integrate small dispersed bases
stationed north of the Han River into Dongducheon and
Euijeongbu area by 2006, and in the 2nd stage, major bases will be
moved to Pyungtaek and Gunsan area by 2008.
The USFK is scheduled to be redeployed into 16 bases within 2
regions as shown in Table 4-4. During this process, more than 50
million Pyung will be transferred to the ROK.
Site preparation and construction for infrastructure to relocate
the 2nd infantry division of US will be completed by late 2008. To
move ahead with it smoothly, the ROK and US concluded the
“Amended Agreement on LPP”in 2004. LPP
(Land Partnership Plan):
During the 33rd SCM (Nov. 15,
2001), ROK and US signed a
letter of intent on LPP, which
was ratified by the ROK

After the ratification of the National Assembly in December
2004, the MND continued to exert all efforts to inform Pyungtaek
residents of governmental policy along with calling for their
understanding through various ways such as resident meetings,
briefing sessions to the local civic group, and press meetings.
While seeking for various measures to support for the local
residents’life, the MND simultaneously pursued purchasing sites
of bases scheduled to be transferred.
As a result of governmental efforts, the ownership of sites on
US was transfered to the MND in January 2006. The MND is
thereafter preparing facility construction including surveys
regarding the planned area and ground investigation.
The ROK government made a “master plan for the facilities”in
2006, and plans to undertake foundation work in 2007, after
completing an evaluation of the environmental impact; an
investigation of the index of cultural assets; measures of migration
such as support for migration of residents in the area concerned;
and the establishment of a migration complex.

C. Transfer of Military Mission
and Modernization of the USFK

(1) Transfer of Military Mission


SCM (Security
Consultative Meeting):
This annual consultative body
comprising the defense
ministers of the two countries
was established to discuss
and resolve major security
issues in the wake of North
Korea's attempted attack on
Cheongwadae and seizure of
the USS Pueblo in 1968. With
the discussion of the potential
withdrawal of the US 7th
division in 1971, the SCM was
upgraded into a full-fledged
security consultative body
both in name and substance
involving high ranking defense
and diplomatic officials of the
two countries. It directs
strategic directives to the
Military Committee.

JSA:
Joint Security Area


The USFK is transferring of some military missions to the ROK
military pursuant to an agreement between the ROK-US in the 34th
SCM, December 2002.
Of the ten military missions that have been assumed by the
USFK, with the exception of day and night search and rescue
operations, the ROK military has already taken over the JSA
security mission, the decontamination operation mission in the rear
area, expediting the burying of mines, the management of the air
to surface firing range, mission of counter-fire operation
headquarters, the control of the main supply route, the operation
of counter-SOP forces at sea, the control of close air support (CAS),
and weather forecasting. Day and night search and rescue
operations will be transferred by the end of 2008. Although the
two nations agreed to review the transfer of additional military


-----

Section 2. Development of the Future-oriented ROK-US Alliance

missions in the 37th SCM (October 2005),
the two decided to integrate it into the
tasks for transition of the OPCON in
accordance with the agreement to
coordinate the military command
relationship.
The transfer of the military mission of
the USFK is meaningful in terms of the
improvement of Korea’s leading role in its
defense as well as the expansion of the
mission corresponding to the increment of Korea’s military
capabilities. Taking into account Korea’s military capabilities on
the basis of this backdrop, the two countries will move ahead with
the transfer of the military mission on an gradual and phased basis.

(2) Modernization of the USFK

The ROK-US committed to reduce the USFK by 12,500
personnel in 3 stages by 2008. If downsizing is implemented
according to the agreed plan, the size of the USFK troops stationed
will be reduced to about 25,000 troops by the end of 2008 from
37,500 in 2003. The step-by-step downsizing scheme agreed by
both sides is shown in Table 4-5.

<Table 4-5> Stage-by-stage downsizing scheme of the USFK for 2004-2008

|Stage|Year|Personnel decreased|Personnel stationed|
|---|---|---|---|
|1st|2004|5,000|32,500|
|2nd|2005~2006|5,000|27,500|
|3rd|2007~2008|2,500|25,000|


To complement the vacuum for a military capability caused by
the downsizing of the USFK, the US stepped up the USFK’s
capability by aiding its force modernization through the investment
of 11 billion dollars into 150 areas over 4 years until 2006, and now
is pursuing the maximum force operation by means of reorganizing
the USFK. Its force modernization is being primarily carried out by
focusing on the strength of combat units, C4ISR and so forth.

2. Transition of Wartime Operational Control and
the New Military Structure for the ROK-US Alliance

A. Background


President Rhee Syngman, the Supreme Commander of the
Korean Military at the time of the Korean War in 1950, handed over
the ROK’s operational control (OPCON) to the UN forces
commander, General McArthur, inevitably to protect the country
from a national crisis. The OPCON was transferred from the UN
forces commander to the CFC commander with the creation of the
CFC in 1978 and then a peacetime OPCON was transferred to the
ROK Joint Chiefs of Staff at the end of 1994. Thereafter, the CFC
commander remained in charge of the wartime OPCON and the
peacetime CODA.
The discussion to transit the OPCON began with a ROK-US study
and consultation on OPCON transition based on the grounds of
both the former presidential candidate, Roh Tae-woo’s campaign
pledge in August 1987, entitled “the transition of OPCON and the
transfer of Yongsan garrison,”and the “EASI”in 1990-1992
following the “Nunn-Warner Amendment”in 1989.
At the 13th MCM in 1993, the ROK-US concluded to transit a
peacetime (during armistice) OPCON between 1993-1995, and to
consult regarding the transition of the wartime OPCON after 1996.
As a result, the ROK government recovered the peacetime OPCON
first on December 1, 1994.
After 1993, KIDA and RAND carried out a joint study on the
development of the future alliance between the two nations. There
were director-level studies and consultations on the direction of the
future ROK-US Alliance and the change in the role of the ROKUSFK between the defense ministries from 1995 to 2002.
In addition, the ROK-US defense authorities have been
assessing their role in future security situations and conducting the
JVS at FOTA and SPI consultations since 2003, and on this basis,
continue to study and consult about the future command
relationship of the ROK and US.

Section 2. Development of the Future-oriented ROK-US Alliance


B. Current Status

On the basis of such a historical background and a study to
develop the future ROK-US alliance, the two sides have started
substantive talks with a common position of accelerating the
discussion on the wartime OPCON in the 37th SCM in October
2005.
Concluding the TOR regarding the study and report on the road
map for transition of wartime OPCON, the ROK and US made a
road map for the wartime OPCON transition through close
consultation of the combined working group. In this context, the
ROK and US agreed, in the SCM held in October 2006, to
“expeditiously complete the transition of OPCON to the ROK after
October 15, 2009, but not later than March 15, 2012.”
The two nations agreed on four principles with regard to the
wartime OPCON transition: (1) it is based on the “ROK-US Mutual
Defense Treaty,”(2) it will ensure the continued stationing of USFK
and deployment of US reinforcement troops, (3) it will continue US
support for bridging capabilities such as intelligence assets, (4) it will
sustain combined readiness posture and deterrence capability.
Something to be prepared for the implementation of the agreed
road map is to substantially build the capabilities necessary for the
independent exercise of the wartime OPCON. This will involve
materialization of a new ROK-US military cooperation system and
the establishment of a series of systems, such as the intelligence
and crisis management cooperation system, echelon-by-echelon
operation plans and the ROK-US combined exercise system.

C. Military Structure of the New ROK-US Alliance

The military structure of the future ROK-US alliance, after
transition of wartime OPCON, is a new system of joint defense in a
“supporting-supported”pattern and for this, the ROK JCS and
USFK plan to establish close cooperative relations to set up a
Military Cooperation Center (MCC).
The MCC will ensure close cooperation, as a core organization
of the ROK-US joint defense system consisting of more than ten
standing or non-standing sub-bodies, in essential fields to maintain

a deterrence and readiness posture, such as intelligence and crisis
management, war plans, exercise and training, etc. By forming
strong cooperative systems in the area of intelligence and the
operation of air force capability, a robust joint defense system
equivalent to the current CFC system will be established.
Through the stable management of North Korea’s military
threat, the advance in South-North relations, groundwork for
military confidence building, and a realignment of the USFK, the
ROK and US will not make the solid ROK-US alliance weaker in its
course of transitting a wartime OPCON, and it will maintain the
ROK-US joint readiness posture firmly to deter any war.

3. Ensuring Conditions for the Stable Stationing
of the USFK

A. Defense Cost Sharing


Defense cost sharing (consultation) implies that the ROK
government will pay a portion of the stationing cost of the USFK
through the conclusion of the “Special Measures Agreement
(SMA)”with the US. The ROK government has been sharing a
portion of the USFK stationing cost since 1991, taking into account
the sharing ratio between the US forces and other friendly nations;
the extent of the USFK’s contribution to the defense for Korea; and
the need to develop the ROK-US military alliance into a
“partnership-based security cooperation.”
The cost sharing contribution by the ROK is applied to four
areas: (1) labor costs regarding Korean employees by the USFK; (2)
military construction costs for building non-combat facilities
including barracks; (3) CDIP costs to back up combat/combat
support facilities including ammunition dumps; and (4) logistics
support costs to provide goods and services including
railway/automobile transport support. In 2004, the ROK
government paid 622 million dollars as its cost sharing
contribution.
The negotiation of defense cost sharing has been carried out
between the ROK Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MOFAT)
and the US Department of State since the major authority dealing


Cost sharing contribution:
It refers to the financial
assistance from the ROK
government to partially cover
the expenses associated with
the US military presence in the
country according to the

with it changed from the MND, which was in charge till 2004, to
MOFAT in 2005.
The defense cost-sharing paid after 2005 was determined in
June 2005 through several senior-level talks initiated in November
2004. The two nations agreed to reduce the defense cost-sharing to
680.4 billion won which would be paid in the Korean currency
(won) effective for 2 years and freezing any rate of increase during
that period. The backdrop to the decrease of the defense costsharing reflects the change of environment such as the relocation
of Yongsan Garrison, LPP, the dispatch of troops to Iraq,
downsizing of the USFK, etc. The distribution ratio of the defense
cost-sharing per area is indicated below in Table 4-6.

<Table 4-6> 2006 Distribution Ratio of Defense Cost-sharing per Area

The ROK and US had held six rounds of senior-level meetings
during the period from May to December 2006, to negotiate
defense cost-sharing after 2007, which, at last, reached a final
agreement on December 6, 2006. This agreement includes a
validity period of 2 years and assigns an amount of 725.5 billion
won as the 2007 defense cost-sharing. It confirms the 2008 cost will
be affected by the increase rate of market price in addition to the
2007 cost. The defense cost-sharing has been paid in the Korean
currency (won) in whole since 2005 to secure the stability and
predictability of the budget.

B. Redressing of Public Grievances and
Improvement of Training Conditions

Training of the USFK in a war-like setting is essential to
maintaining a solid combined defense posture. However, accidents
and damage caused by the US forces as well as severe noise from
US Air Force firing ranges have left many people in the ROK,
including local residents, discontent with the situation. This triggers
a deterioration in the training conditions.
To resolve this issue, the two countries took measures to
improve the operation of SOFA to improve the surrounding
circumstances of the training grounds and to implement safety
measures which must be observed by the USFK during training. In
particular, the ROK government took measures such as the
installation of safety facilities, construction of sidewalks, and
improvement/expansion of winding or bottleneck roads in the
northern part of Gyeonggi Province. Moreover, the USFK is
seeking to improve its relations with local residents by adopting
comprehensive safety measures during training in conjunction with
giving prior notice of unit movement plans.
In the context of regarding the ROK-US alliance as a basis for
the sake of national security, it is a very significant task to stably
manage an allied country and to ensure the proper training
conditions for the USFK which is indispensable for the
maintenance of combined defense posture. Therefore, by
minimizing people’s damage and inconvenience, the government
is seeking to improve all conditions so that the USFK can carry on
with an effective training program.

C. Activities for Strengthening Ties
between ROK and US

Based on the common belief that it is
imperative to promote mutual understanding
by consolidating human relations, the ROK
and the US are jointly developing and
implementing programs aimed at boosting

- ROK-US friendly tug-of-war game friendly ties among the ROK Armed Forces,


-----

Section 2. Development of the Future-oriented ROK-US Alliance


USFK, and local residents.
In a bid to increase mutual goodwill activities, the ROK military
has been implementing such programs as the establishment of
brotherhood relationships between the ROK and US military units,
events inviting USFK soldiers, and guardian programs for USFK
soldiers. The USFK is also providing a wide variety of programs of
the similar nature including the New Horizons Day, the Good
Neighbor Program, and the Community Outreach Program.
Furthermore, the USFK is endeavoring to win support of the local
people by assisting farmers during busy seasons, flood relief, and
medical support.
Such efforts contribute enormously to creating stable working
conditions for the USFK by providing opportunities for US soldiers
and South Koreans, who have different cultures and backgrounds,
to share a sense of cultural unity.
The ROK government continues to make combined efforts with
the USFK to prevent and minimize inconvenience or harm to the
local people dwelling near US bases. By doing so, residents nearby
the US bases and USFK as good neighbors will develop a new
cooperative relationship that will contribute to local development,
coexisting peacefully.

D. Development of the Future ROK-US Alliance

For the past 50 years, the ROK-US alliance has remained a
cornerstone for the maintenance of peace and stability not only in
the Korean Peninsula but in Northeast Asia. On this basis, the ROKUS relations have expanded further in the fields of close security
cooperation, vital economic exchange and civilian cooperation.
The ROK-US alliance is adapting itself to changes in the security

environment and is extending the value of democracy and market
economy beyond a simple military alliance.
Based on the successful agreement of FOTA, the two countries reached
the consensus that it was necessary to organize a similar consultative body
and to engage in comprehensive discussions about not only outstanding
issues of the present but also agendas associated with future development
of the alliance. Thus, they have
been placing SPI in operation since
2005. In this body, the ROK-US joint
study has been assigned three
agendas: Comprehensive Security
Assessment (CSA), Joint Vision
Study (JVS), and Command
Relations Study (CRS).
In the Joint Communique of

the 38th SCM held in Washington
on October 20, 2006, the US Defense Secretary D. Rumsfeld assured
solid commitment and expedient support of the US pursuant to the

extended deterrence through the provision of a US nuclear umbrella.
The ROK-US alliance now remains more solid than ever. In the

future, the ROK-US will develop their relations into a
“comprehensive, dynamic, and mutually beneficial alliance,”by
readjusting the alliance on the basis of reflecting the progress of
North-South relations as well as a change of security environment.

Section 3. Promotion of External Military Cooperation

The objective of the ROK's military diplomacy is not only to deter war
on the Korean Peninsula but to secure international support and
assistance in the case of an emergency. It is further to resolve the North
Korean nuclear problem peacefully by establishing mutual trust with
friendly nations, and more broadly, to contribute to international peace
while improving peace and stability in Northeast Asia.

To achieve this goal, the ROK military maintains and develops
balanced military relations with neighboring countries along with the
consolidated ROK-US alliance. It is also actively pressing ahead with the
mutilateral military cooperation and expanding military exchanges among
regional countries.

Moreover, according to the remarkable economic growth and the
development of democratization, the ROK military contributes to
international peace and stability by actively participating in international
peace keeping and arms control activities to carry out a role
corresponding to national prestige in the international community.

1. Military Relations With Neighboring Countries

A. ROK-Japan Relations

Japan shares the universal values of democracy and a market
economy system with the ROK, and it is an important neighboring
country which exerts joint efforts for the sake of
regional stability and peace. The MND holds
diverse working-level meetings regularly, such
as the ROK-Japan defense ministerial talks,
defense policy working-level meetings, and
security policy conferences. Through the
exchange of views concerning the assessment of
security situations and the direction of defense
policy, the two nations endeavor to extend the
scope of mutual understanding and cooperation

- ROK-Japan delegates' conference on military exchange


-----

Chapter Strengthening Future-oriented Defense Capabilities
4

for the stability and peace of the Korean Peninsula and in the
region.
However, questions regarding matters of historical perception
between the two countries and Japan’s wrong insistence on the
rights of possession over the Dok-do island, are regarded as factors
that need to be overcome in favor of developing military
exchanges and cooperation in a future-oriented direction.
Since the two nations’first defense ministerial meeting was
held in 1994, they have been holding senior-military level
exchanges such as exchange visits between the Chiefs of the Army,
Navy and Air Force, working-level defense policy conferences,
meetings between military authorities, and intelligence exchange
conferences, etc. The personnel exchanges involving mutual
exchange visits between staff colleges and cadets, and exchange of
military personnel are being made more actively than ever. They
also have been improving various military exchanges, such as
ROK-Japan maritime search and rescue exercise, mutual visits of
cargo airplane, and mutual cooperation (East Timor, Iraq) in
international peace keeping activities.
In the future, maintaining firm military confidence and ties with
Japan which has been formed thus far, the ROK military hopes to
move forward to a “future-oriented ROK-Japan cooperative
relationship”with the ROK-Japan summit in October 2006
providing the momentum. It will further materialize substantive
security cooperation between the two nations in order to
accomplish a Northeast Asian era of peace and prosperity and the
regional and international cooperation in addition to a peaceful
resolution of the North Korean nuclear issue.

B. ROK-China Relations

Due to the special nature of the regional security environment
surrounding the Korean peninsula, more substantial and reciprocal
military exchanges between the ROK and China are limited. The
development of military relations between the two countries is,
however, very significant for the sake of both for resolving pending
security issues such as the North Korean nuclear issue and for
stability and peace of the Korean Peninsula and in the Northeast


-----

Section 3. Promotion of External Military Cooperation

Asian region in the future. To this end, the two
sides should diversify and revitalize mutual
military exchanges which are at the beginning
stage compared to other fields. The starting point
should be a desire to expand the foundation of
versatile military relations through regular and
institutionalized exchanges based on mutual
understanding and military dialogue.
The ROK-China military exchanges have been

- Naval Academy midshipmen’s port call in China

steadily developing since the opening of ROK
defense attache’s office in Beijing in December 1993 and Chinese
defense attache’s office in Seoul in April 1994. They continue on
the basis of a “full-fledged cooperative partnership”agreed by the
two government leaders in July 2003.
Military exchanges between ROK and China consist of three
levels such as military leader’s level, working-level exchanges, and
other exchanges. The military leader’s exchanges are conducted in
the form of mutual visits between the defense ministers, the
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (the Chief of General Staff),
the Chiefs of the Army, Navy and Air Force, and field commanders
(military regions commander and political commissar). The military
working-level exchanges are largely performed between the
Ministry of National Defense, the Joint Chiefs of Staff and persons
in charge of intelligence and policy in the Army, Navy and Air
Force. Additionally, annual defense academic conferences, military
affairs studies, mutual visits by heads of educational institution,
short-term visits/research studies by student officers of the Army,
Navy and Air Force colleges, and various sorts of sports exchanges
are in progress. The two nations also have been carrying out
mutual visits of navy vessels and aircraft since 2001.

C. ROK-Russia Relations

Following the establishment of diplomatic relations in 1990, the
ROK and Russia opened defense attache’s offices in 1991. Since
then, the two countries have made much progress in establishing
systems for building military confidence and improving cooperation
including military leaders’exchanges.


-----

Chapter Strengthening Future-oriented Defense Capabilities
4

The two countries have been forming a
“constructive and complementary partnership”for
16 years since 1990 when bilateral diplomatic
relations were established. President Roh Moohyun, who visited Russia in September 2004,
stipulated bilateral relations as a comprehensive
partnership of mutual confidence, which
established a foothold for the two nations to take
one step forward.

- Agreement to prevent dangerous military During the ROK defense minister’s visit to
activities between ROK and Russia

Russia in April 2005, two defense ministers
agreed that peace and stability in Northeast Asia
would be indispensable to both countries’security, and further
agreed to increase Russia’s contribution in regard to inter-Korean
relations and military exchange and cooperation. In addition,
meetings, such as the first army delegation’s conference held in
2005, defense policy working-level meetings held annually, and the
military joint committee to implement the “Agreement to prevent
dangerous military activities between ROK-Russia”provide
opportunity to consolidate bilateral military confidence building
and substantial military cooperation.
High-ranking military leaders’reciprocal visits, such as the
Russian Air Force commander’s visit to Korea in March 2006, Far
Eastern region commander’s visit to Korea in June 2006, and the
ROK MND vice-minister’s visit to Russia in September 2006, are in
active progress.
Bilateral military exchange cooperation is being expanded and
developed between the two nations. For example, both maritime
joint search/rescue and counterterror exercises are being
conducted in parallel with reciprocal visits of the two nations'
vessels.
Such a military relation between the ROK-Russia will continue
to contribute to the realization of a peace settlement on the Korean
Peninsula and regional peace and stability in Northeast Asia.

2. Relations with Off-Region

A. Southeast Asia and Oceania

Southeast Asia is increasingly emerging as an
important area because ASEAN-centered stable
security structure continues to be maintained in the
post Cold War. In particular, the need for military
exchanges and cooperation becomes greater day
by day as the need for the safety of sea lanes of
communication, such as the Straits of Malacca,
becomes significant, and the possibility for
cooperation in the defense industry is gradually
increasing. - ROK-Vietnam Defense Ministers Talks
Thus, the ROK military pushes ahead with
military exchanges and cooperation with South East
Asian countries focusing on military leaders’
exchanges, intelligence exchange conferences, and
defense industry and logistics joint committee. In
addition, there are active visits by military leading
figures of Indonesia, Thailand and Philippine, and
defense university students.
Defense diplomacy in the Oceania is carried out
with the focus on Australia and New Zealand. They - ROK-Australia Defense Ministers Talks
have common interests with ROK in securing sea
lanes of communication, and due to the similarity of major weapon
systems to that of Korea, military exchanges and cooperation are in
active progress on favorable condition of defense industry
cooperation.
In May 2005, the former defense minister, Mr. Yoon Kwangung, who visited Australia held a defense ministers meeting. At the
meeting, the ROK MND discussed mutual security affairs of interest
and measures to improve the exchanges with Australia and New
Zealand through defense policy working group meetings held
every year. They are currently engaged in various military
exchange activities including exchange visits of naval vessels and
defense university graduates, and the exchange of military
education.

B. Europe

Military diplomacy moves ahead, aiming at the
development of an advanced military doctrine and
technology through military exchanges
activities, and improvement of defense
industry exports, through reciprocal
exchange of military science technologies.
To consolidate ties with nations that
participated in the Korean War, the ROK
has paid close attention to and provided
support to invite Korean War veterans to
Korea, erect monuments commemorating
European participation in the war, and provide

- Participation of the MND's Military Band
in the Event of "2005 Korean Year" for exchanges among generations who have

never experienced the war.
Among recent activities involving major military exchanges, the
ROK defense minister’s visit to Turkey in September 2005, and the
Turkish defense minister’s visit to Korea in July 2006, provided
momentum in promoting mutual military exchange/cooperation
and friendly relations.
Among regular bilateral consultations with European nations
are the joint defense policy working-level meetings, joint defence
industry and logistics committee meetings, and intelligence
exchange meetings. With a focus on defense industrial
cooperation, the ROK is increasing the number of countries with
which it engages in mutual exchanges.
Concerning military education exchanges, ROK military officers
are being trained at military educational institutes of six countries
including Germany, Greece, and Sweden. In return, military
officers from Turkey and France are being trained at ROK military
training institutes. The above cases indicate brisk exchanges of
military education.

C. Southwest Asia and Middle East

ROK military exchanges with countries in the Southwest Asian
region have been developed with a focus on India, Pakistan, and


-----

Section 3. Promotion of External Military Cooperation

Bangladesh. Specifically, it makes vital exchanges with them
by exchange visits of defense university students, dispatch
for officer’s education, and reciprocal visits of cruise fleets.
Regarding military relations with Middle East countries,
the significance of their strategic value is increasing in terms
of energy security. Furthermore, the MND is expanding the
cooperation of reciprocal military exchanges including an
establishment of mutual defense attache’s office, defense

- ROK JCS Chairman's courtesy call

industry exports, and technological cooperation as friendly on UAE Chief of General Staff
circumstances created by the dispatch of Korean troops to
Iraq and the need for military exchanges is incremented.
In particular, the MND is strengthening military exchange and
cooperation with Middle Eastern countries through its conclusion
of SOFA agreements to send liaison officers to units subject to US
Central Command stationed in Qatar in February 2006, and its
conclusion of defense cooperation agreement with UAE in
December as well.

D. Other Regions


The MND consults closely with Canada on national
defense issues through regular defense policy workinglevel meetings, and further promotes friendly military
relations bilaterally through exchanges such as naval
combined training and mutual visits of naval vessels.
As the Central American region has been expanding
rapidly since the conclusion of free trade agreements, it
is expected that military exchanges with these regional
countries involving defense industry cooperation and
military education exchanges will continue increasing. - Vice Defense Minister, signing a

ROK-Brazil Defense Cooperation Agreement

The vice-defense minister’s visit to Guatemala in March
2006, paved the way for facilitating defense industry cooperation.
Particularly, in relation with Brazil, there was a positive outcome
which involved the conclusion of defense cooperation
agreements. These are expected to contribute to a future-oriented
defense industry and logistics cooperation with Central American
countries.
Concerning the Central Asian region, economic exchange

cooperation between the ROK and CIS nations has been rapidly
increasing since the ROK president’s visit to Kazakhstan in
September 2004, to Azerbaijan in May 2006, and the Prime
Minister’s visit to Ukraine in 2005. In line with these activities,
there have been many developments in defense diplomatic spheres
such as the setting up of systems to promote military exchange and
cooperation encompassing the ROK military’s support in founding
the Kazakhstan navy in 2005, military leaders’reciprocal visits, and
the conclusion of the “MOU on exchange cooperation of military
education between ROK-Kazakhstan.”
Hereafter, military relations between Korea and CIS nations will
focus on the comprehensive security cooperation in combination
with securing energy resources, diplomacy for economic
cooperation, and creating circumstances for defense industry
cooperation.
Although military exchanges with the African region are yet to
be activated, mutual exchanges need to be developed as Africa’s
role in the international stage will be greater in the future taking
into account its potential as it makes up around one fourth of the
world’s countries in number.

3. International Peace Activities

A. UN Peacekeeping Operations (PKO)

The UN PKO started with the UNTSO in 1948, to resolve
interstate conflicts peacefully with the creation of the UN after the
second World War.
As the pattern of regional conflicts has changed to domestic
conflicts and internal wars since the 1990s in the post Cold War, the
recent PKO are being broadened not only to include surveillance
activities in the conflict region, but also to bring resolution to the
conflict (peace enforcement) or reconstruction activities after the
conflict settlement. As the conduct of complex missions requiring
the participation of the military, police, and civic sectors is
demanded, the type of participation is divided into several groups
who can fulfill missions, such as the surveillance group, the
peacekeeping forces, and the combined PKO.

Section 3. Promotion of External Military Cooperation

(1) ROK Mlilitary’s PKO

☞Refer to Appendix 8

“Status of the UN PKO.”

The ROK joined as one of the UN member states, and
performed an exemplary PKO when a detachment of construction
engineering corps was sent to Somalia in July 1993 (UNOSOM-II) UNOSOM-II:

United Nations Operation in

which was suffering from starvation due to armed conflicts and Somalia
drought.
Also the Field engineering corps with more than 160 persons
were sent to Angola from October 1995 to February 1997, and a
battalion size infantry unit was dispatched to East Timor from
October 1999 to October 2003. Those operations contributed to
human rights protection and peace settlement in support of
community reconstruction and the recovery of public peace and
order. - Medical support unit's

completion of

Furthermore, the ROK military medical support group was the mission in the Western

Sahara (May 17, 2006)

dispatched to the Western Sahara and rotated its mission with a
Malaysian unit. It then was pulled out after executing its final
mission of the 23th dispatch contingent unit on 17 May 2006. It
carried out anti-epidemic support and activities aimed at preventing
infectious diseases in local people on the basis of a medical
support mission to all the PKO members for more than 10 years
from September 1994.
Meanwhile, since the ROK armed forces dispatched the
UNMOGIP to India/Pakistan in 1994, it has carried out missions
such as armistice monitoring, patrol, inspection and mediation by
dispatching 30 field-grade officers to Georgia, Liberia, Burundi,
Sudan and Afghanistan as military observers.
Conducting the mission of PKO participation successfully
several times thus far, the ROK military has contributed greatly to
enhancing its national image and national prestige in recognition of
being the most exemplary country amongst the nations
participating under the UN flag. Aggressive and active
humanitarian relief activities and local rehabilitation activities
provided a decisive momentum in conveying a friendly image
through Korean’s self-sacrificing attitude to the local people.
The above activities contributed to increasing Korea’s national
prestige and helping Korea be elected as a non-permanent member
of the UNSC. These also became stepping stones for displaying


-----

Chapter Strengthening Future-oriented Defense Capabilities
4

Korea’s diplomatic capability in a variety of international political
arenas, such as assuming high-ranking posts including the UN
Secretary General (UNSG) and Special Representative of the UNSG.

(2) Expansion of PKO Participation

The fundamental purpose of the UNPKO, regarding regional
conflicts and the violation of basic human rights like the right to
life which they suggested as main challenge to human coprosperity, is to embody perpetual world peace by peaceful
resolutions through unified responses.
Particularly, in consideration of the reality of inter-Korean military
tension yet to be resolved fundamentally, the ROK is able to build up
its image as a peace loving country and set up a foundation for
securing support from the international community with respect to
issues of the Korean Peninsula by means of its extended participation
in the international PKO. In addition, Korea can make use of this
image as a foundation for consolidating diplomatic capacity in the
international political stage, for example, the UN.
The MND has adopted institutional measures to expand Korea’s
international PKO participation as part of the “National Defense Reform
2020”and is actively pressing ahead with these measures. From 2007, to
secure a more aggressive and active international PKO participation as a
nation producing the UN Secretary General, the MND supports overall
activities covering civil, government, and military, and also sets up policy
direction to diversify the region participated. With its detailed
performance task, it moves ahead with the upgrade of “UN Stand-by
Arrangements System,”the formation of PKO standing army and the
creation of the national level PKO center.
The UN Stand-by Arrangements System, as a system to facilitate
and expedite the deployment of member states engaging in the
PKO, categorizes the level of participation into 3 stages: the first
stage is to notify the “unit scale”capable of PKO participation to the
UN and the second one is to hand in “detailed planning data”over
PKO participation units. The third is to conclude MOU with UN.
Despite participating in the Stand-by Arrangements System, the
MND is not to accept it automatically but to be able to decide
whether it will dispatch troops independently. Prompt power


-----

Section 3. Promotion of External Military Cooperation

projection to the conflict area and immediate response through
preliminary training are to become critical factors for the success or
failure of the mission assigned. Hence, the timely participation in an
emergency situation, with “preparation of an appropriate scale of a
PKO stand-by unit”would be able to maximize participation impact.
Furthermore, the MND is under active review regarding a plan
to “found a state-level PKO center”in charge of policy study for
PKO and comprehensive education covering civil, government,
and military. Hereafter, establishing a state-level integrated
educational system through the foundation/operation of the above
center, the MND expects to maintain the consistency in its relevant
policies and PKO operational systems.


B. International PKO through MNF (Multi-National Forces)

With the September 11 attacks in 2001, the international
community has come to regard indiscriminate international terrorism
as a common enemy of mankind, and regards it as a pressing issue
which should be resolved multilaterally.
Facing new challenges such as international terrorism, the PKO in
the international community is expanding from a type of PKF which
previously conducted activities to conform to direct UN
command/supervision to a type of regional security organization such
as NATO or MNF led by a specific country. In particular, in the course
of carrying out the war on terror after September 11, the US considers
international terrorism to be the biggest enemy against world peace
and human security, and it plays a significant role in building up
counter-terrorism coalitions in the international society.
With the approval of the national assembly, the ROK
government dispatched Korean troops to Afghanistan and Iraq to
participate in the counter-terrorism international coalition, for the
sake of world peace and human safety, and to contribute to the
stability of post-war peace stability in Afghanistan and Iraq.

treatment activities, and peace reconstruction pursuant to UNSC
1368/1373, the ROK government dispatched several naval/air force
transportation units. Domestic enactment procedures included the
approval of the national assembly (September 2001) and the dispatch
of ROK medical support units (Dongeui unit) in February, and a
construction engineering unit (Dasan unit) in February in 2003.
The ROK medical support unit, consisting of more than 60
persons (more than 670 persons per year) at present, is conducting
medical support and anti-infectious disease activities for the
coalition forces and local residents based on Korea’s excellent
medical technology. The construction engineering support unit,
comprising more than 150 persons (more than 1,030 persons per
year), is performing a variety of missions such as construction/civil
engineering work, ROK-US combined PRT support, and support for
the people.
Reforming their mission in an exemplary manner and
conducting activities for civil affairs, on the basis of friendship with
the local community, including humanitarian level of relief,
medical treatment activities and construction support activities. As
well as operating Taekwondo (Korean martial art) and Korean
language (Hangeul) classes, the Dongeui/Dasan units are highly
appreciated by coalition forces and local residents.

(2) Seohee/Jema Units’Dispatch to Iraq

Since the US-led coalition countries began to take military
action against Iraq in March 2003, the ROK government has
convened an ad hoc cabinet meeting on March 21 and made a
decision to detach Korean troops. This decision was also made
also in consideration of the international attitude toward the war
against Iraq and the significance of the ROK-US alliance.
The National Assembly passed a resolution in favor of dispatching
Korean forces. It focused on dispatching one battalion (less than 600
persons) of construction engineering support corps and a medical
support unit of less than 100 persons from April 2, 2003.
Consequently, the MND dispatched 200 persons from the construction
engineering support unit (Soehee unit) and 90 persons of medical
support unit (Jema unit) to Nasiriya in Iraq April 30, 2003.

Section 3. Promotion of External Military Cooperation

For more than one year until August 31, 2004, the Soehee and
Jema units actively supported the coalition force’s base operation,
the humanitarian level of post-war rehabilitation support and the
medical support activities for local people.
These units, in addition to supporting 46 cases of postrehabilitation work, including new construction of hospitals and
schools and water-supply facilities/sewage constructions, executed
humanitarian support projects. They also donated medical devices,
medicines, wheelchairs, erected an IT center, and performed
scholarship activities as well as giving medical treatments for
approximately 15 thousand patients. Such devoted activities of the
Soehee and Jema units contributed not only to the Iraqi peace
settlement but to laying the grounds for the activities of the peace
reconstruction division and enhanced Korea’s national prestige.

(3) Peace/Reconstruction Support Unit’s Dispatch to Iraq

The US, after declaring the end of the Iraqi war on May 1, 2003,
requested an additional dispatch of Korean forces to Iraq on
September 4, the same year.
In this context, the ROK government announced a plan for an
additional dispatch on October 18, 2003, and concluded the plan
on December 17 through deliberate discussion. The dispatch
focused on providing support for peace and reconstruction and it
was independently in charge of a specific area with less than 3,000
troops.
With the approval of the 245th National Assembly on February
13, 2004, the MND organized the Zaytoon unit
comprising of more than 3,600 elite troops involving
Sohee and Jema units as Iraqi peace/reconstruction
support units. Thereafter, it was decided that they
would be dispatched in Arbil after close consultation
between the ROK and US and several field
investigations. It terminated deployment in July
2004, with the 1st echelon of 3,566 soldiers in total,
taking advantage of airforce, maritime and ground
transport. - Ground maneuver of Zaytoon Unit

community on the basis of a lucid sense of
mission and self-esteem. The humanitarian
support activities of the unit, have been
evaluated as being of the most exemplary
standard and have won the reputation that they
demonstrate a “model of civil affairs operations.”
In addition, the unit is recognized as a member

of the local community by the local people, since
it maintains close cooperative relations with the
Kurdish local government and takes the lead in local
reconstruction. The president of the Kurdish local government has
mentioned that “we had no friend except mountain so far but now
we have come to call Koreans our friends.”

4. Multilateral Security Cooperation and
International Disarmament Activities

A. Multilateral Security Cooperation

Today, with problems of unconventional and transnational
issues such as terrorism, drugs and the environment as well as
conventional security issues such as territory, races and religion
have been unveiled, the significance of multilateral security
cooperation is increasing.
Multilateral security cooperation seeks to resolve through
dialogue and cooperation on a multilateral basis, pending regional
issues in the areas of politics, diplomacy, economy, society and
culture as well as a variety of security issues that could develop
into regional conflicts. It further strives for prevention and peaceful
resolution of the conflict. Taking into account such characteristics,
multilateral security cooperation is greatly needed in the Northeast
Asian region Where the Cold War structure still exists.
Though multilateral security cooperation functions to enable
pan-regional countries to respond to transnational security issues,
there are limitations in resolving security issues due to delay in


-----

Section 3. Promotion of External Military Cooperation

decision making process and non-binding implementation of the
agreements. As such, the multilateral process has practical
limitations in resolving structural security problems in Northeast
Asia.
Thus, the multilateral security cooperation in Northeast Asia
encounters difficulties. Accordingly, the ROK government will
continue to make every effort to complement bilaterally
cooperative relations to improve security environments on the
Korean Peninsula as well as in this region, and to lay the
foundation of establishing a multilateral cooperative body in
Northeast Asia.
In Particular, the government expects the Six Party talks to
resolve North Korea’s nuclear problem and successfully progress
toward a multilateral cooperative body in Northeast Asia. ARF:ASEAN Regional Forum
Meanwhile, the ROK government is taking an active part in

a peaceful resolution of North Korea’s nuclear issue through the
Six Party talks, the MND has continued to make efforts for a
prompt resolution of North Korea’s nuclear problem and a
peaceful settlement for the Korean peninsula.
The ARF is trying to push ahead with development

outcome accomplished so far. Thus, related agencies and
departments need to take special concerns and make preparations
regarding discussion issues in each area and development trends.
In April 2006, the 17th NEACD was held, in Tokyo, Japan, with
the longest and most vigorous activities among nongovernmental
dialogue bodies in Northeast Asia. This meeting provided all
delegations of the Six Party Talks with the venue for dialogue in
which North Korea’s nuclear issue could be discussed, instead of
the Six Party talks under stalemate. Thereby, it gained global
attention and confirmed its usefulness.
The MND, dispatching a delegation to the “Defense Intelligence
Sharing Conference,”prepared momentum not only to introduce
the government’s defense policy and defense reform but also to
improve military transparency of the ROK.
The former defense minister, Yoon Kwang-ung, participated,
for the second time, in the “Asia Security Meeting”held in
Singapore in June 2006 subsequent to 2005. In a speech in the
meeting, entitled the “Participation of Military Power for
International Security,”he introduced the ROK force’s peace
keeping activities and the effort to upgrade the level of Korea’s
participation in the “UN Stand-by Arrangements System”from the
current 1st stage to the 3rd stage, and proposed to seriously review
the measures to respond substantially and effectively to
international scale of disaster.

B. International Disarmament Activities

Currently, the international community regards the proliferation
of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, and its delivery
means, missiles, as serious threats against world peace and
stability, and seeks close cooperation to prevent proliferation of
these weapons.
The ROK has been promoting international disarmament and
nonproliferation activities more actively since joining the UN in
1991. The ROK, through implementing its duty cordially as a
member state of relevant international regimes and taking positive
actions on behalf of the international disarmament and
nonproliferation regimes, contributes to international peace and

ROK government’s initiative. The government is concerned about
14 non-member states like North Korea. Being reelected as a
member of the executive board in the 11th meeting of the states
parties in 2006, the ROK reconfirms its position in the Asian region.
The ROK delegation, proposing the measures to secure
universality in the 2nd Review Conference in 2006, led member
states to urge non-member states’participation and early
implementation of the convention.
Sharing the necessary information between
the related ministries within the government and
maintaining consistency of policy in the
activation of consultation meetings relevant to
export control of the strategic materials from
2002, the government prevents and actively
intercepts on a government-wide level, defense

Thus, the MND is in the middle of stepping up its international
influence in the areas of international disarmament and
nonproliferation, by securing transparency and enhancing
international reliability regarding WMD through broad international
disarmament and nonproliferation activities.

divides the area under the
control of the UNC commander
and the area under control of
North Korea's commander.
the MDL starts from the
northern bank of the river
Imjingang with MDL No. ooo1
and continues to the East Sea
district with MDL No. 1292

NLL (Northern Limit Line):
It is a line the UNC
commander established in
Aug. 1953 to restrict patrol
activities of the ROK Airforce in
conjunction with the purpose of
reducing the possibility of an
occurrence of and preventing
accidental armed clashes
between the South and North,
the NLL was established on the
criteria of the prolonged line of
the MDL toward the East Sea
and an intermediate line
between 5 islands in the
northwest and North Korean
area toward the West Sea.


The ROK military has continued to make efforts to strengthen the
perception that both the mitigation of inter-Korean military tension and the
mutual confidence building for peace on the Korean peninsula based on
the government’s “peace and prosperity policy”are more important than
anything else.

In particular, through a series of South-North military talks, the MND
has, in priority, pushed ahead with measures to mitigate the tension in
and around the West Sea and the MDL which have been areas of
significant tension.

Meanwhile, by supporting/assuring inter-Korean exchange/cooperation
projects carried out through the MDL and NLL militarily, the MND has
made use of it as a catalyst for reducing inter-Korean military tension.

As a consequence, it is recognized that they contributed, more or less,
to mitigating military tension in and around MDL, a symbol of inter-Korean
confrontation.

1. Mitigation of Military Tension on the West Sea


The elevation of military tension on the West Sea
resulted from the so-called “West Sea Clash”where
North Korean naval vessels invaded the NLL fortythree times deliberately from October to November
1973. Since then, the “West Sea engagement”on
June 29, 2002, following the “Yeonpyung Naval
Battle,”where a naval skirmish took place between
South-North navies on June 15, 1999, resulted in
cooling down an atmosphere of inter-Korean

- The Chamsuri 357 that engaged in the West Sea

reconciliation/cooperation that had been created since naval campaign
the “June 15 ROK-DPRK Joint Declaration.”
Under these circumstances, the government
deemed the measures for mitigating tension in the West Sea to be
urgent. It activated the first round of inter-Korean General-level

military talks in May 2004, and then adopted
the “ Agreement on the Prevention of
Accidental Naval Clashes in the West Sea, and
the Cessation of Propaganda Activities, the
Elimination of Propaganda Apparatus in the
Military Demarcation Line Areas (hereafter 6/4
agreement),”and “Its Annex”in the second
inter-Korean General-level talks and workinglevel delegation meetings.

- 1st Round of the inter-Korean
General-Level Military Talks(May 2004) As measures to prevent accidental armed

clashes in the West Sea, the two sides agreed
to establish emergency liaison systems in the “6/4 agreement”: ①
use/communication of an international common network for
commercial vessels; ②establishment/use of visual signal (signal
lights and flags) provisions; ③intelligence sharing regarding illicit
fishing boats of a third country; and ④installation of a
communication liaison office in the West Sea.
In particular, the mutual communications utilizing subsidiary
means like international common network for commercial vessels
and visual signals (e.g., signal lights and flags), prevented mutual
confrontation and occurrence of misunderstanding caused by
missing sea routes and shipwreck relief. It also reduced the
possibility of the occurrence of accidental clashes. It is further
recognized that such communications contribute to mitigating
military tension in the West Sea.
The two sides, sharing the view that accidental skirmishes
could take place in the process of controlling a third-countries’
fishing boats, which made illegal fishing in the sensitive waters of
the West Sea, agreed to exchange the daily information as to illicit
fishing vessels. The fact that they have implemented it faithfully so
far since June 15, 2004, helps to build confidence in the program,
even though it might be merely rudimentary.
In conjunction with that, the communication liaison office
installed in the West Sea as of August 13, 2005 provided the
channel for direct communication with each other in use of
wire/wireless means between inter-Korean naval authorities. It
now can prevent the possibility for the occurrence of accidental
clashes in the West Sea and plays the role of liaison system capable


-----

Section 4. Mitigation of Inter-Korean Military Tension

of preventing the escalation in the event of clashes.
Since mutual communication rates below expectation in spite
of a series of such measures, the need to improve prevention
measures concerning accidental skirmishes in the West Sea was
raised. Thus, the government has been pressing ahead with
consultations with North Korea as well as seeking ways to establish
inter-Korean joint fishing waters, and create maritime cooperation.
As result of these efforts, “the third inter-Korean General-level
military talks”were held in the “Tongilgak (Unification Pavilion)”
within Panmunjeom from 2 to 3 March 2006. In this meeting, the
ROK delegation urged the North Korean delegation to agree to
consultation for peaceful settlements in the West Sea, bringing
forward the issue regarding the “Prevention of Armed Clashes in the
West Sea and Establishment of Joint Fishing
Waters.”However, the delegation from North
Korea maintained that the two sides should consult
on the NLL in the West Sea, in advance, in order to
sort out the risk of clashes in the West Sea
fundamentally. Therefore, the two sides terminated
the talks without agreement.
“The forth inter-Korean General-level Military
Talks”(May 16-18, 2006, “The House of Peace,”
Panmunjeom) resumed after more than two - 4th Round of the Inter-Korean General-Level
months, North Korea avoided discussions about Military Talks (May 2006)
substantive mitigation of tension while reiterating the past position
that North Korea should, first of all, deal with matters to fix the NLL.
In this context, regarding “insistence on the negotiation of NLL issue
first”proposed by North Korea, the ROK delegation expressed the
view that it had intention to be able to discuss it in the “Defense
Ministerial Talks”on the premise of implementing (1) the principle
which was to respect/observe existing waters the South and North
had exercised jurisdiction over as having been agreed in the 1992
Inter-Korean Basic Agreement, and (2) military items agreed in the
Basic Agreement, in the midst of the North’s negative reaction.
In the future, the ROK government will continue to move on
with bilateral consultation with the North for peace settlement in the
West Sea while faithfully implementing measures to prevent
accidental clashes pursuant to the “June 4 agreement.”Concerning

the attempt to inactivate the NLL by North Korea, the
government will keep the NLL resolutely as the MDL until the
new NLL is determined, since the NLL is a firm maritime
demarcation line which has been maintained for the past 50
years. The ROK will continue taking a firm stance over the
existing position that is to respond determinedly to North Korea’
s invasion.

2. Mitigation of Military Tension Around MDL

A. Military Assurance of a Passage
Through the South-North Administration Area

The ROK military has made efforts for military support
and assurance of inter-Korean exchange/cooperation,
and to make those activities result in the mitigation of
tension in the military area. As a result, the 1st round of
the inter-Korean Defense Ministers Talks was held in
September 2000. The two sides agreed to hold workinglevel meeting to support the inter-Korean railway and
road connection projects in conjunction with military

- The 1st round of the inter-Korean
Defense Ministers Talks support for exchange and cooperation.

In particular, after the adoption of the
“Agreement on Military Assurances for Designation of the Joint
Administration Area in the East and West Coastal districts, and
the Construction of Railways and Roads Connecting the South
and North”(hereafter refered to as the Military Assurance
Agreement) in the 7th inter-Korean military working-level
meeting held in September 2002, the inter-Korean Joint
Administration Area was designated with a partial opening of
the DMZ near the Kyungeui and Donghae lines. In addition,
the construction works to connect railways and roads nearly
reaching the last stages as of December 2006. Thus, Gaesung
industrial complex project and overland tour came to be
possible. More than 20 meetings were, thereafter, held between
inter-Korean military authorities to consult military assurance
issues of the railways/roads connection works and the passing.
Exchanges of direct communication and various documents


-----

Section 4. Mitigation of Inter-Korean Military Tension

took place everyday between the South and North Korean
military servicemen, by installation of telephone and fax
machine with one circuit respectively, in military situation rooms
located in Kyungeui and Donghae lines. In the process of
transferring personnel and materials through the railways and
roads, a momentum has been created that the DMZ, formerly the
actual site of inter-Korean confrontation, is now able to be utilized
peacefully.

B. Suspension of Propaganda Activity
and Implementation of Agreement
on the Elimination of Propaganda Means

The aforementioned the “June 4 Agreement”involves
agreements with regard to the suspension of propaganda activities
around the MDL and the elimination of propaganda means in
conjunction with an agreement related to the prevention of
accidental clashes in the West Sea.
This agreement focuses on (1) the suspension of propaganda
activities from June 15, 2004; (2) the elimination of propaganda
means around the MDL with 3 steps until August 15, 2004; and (3)
the reinstallation of propaganda means and prohibition of
resuming propaganda activities. Owing to this agreement, the
Inter-Korean propaganda war avtivities which used to be labelled
as war without bullet were suspended and there means were
eliminated, resulting in making opportunity to support
the ROK government reconciliation and cooperation
policy.

3. Military Support for inter-Korean
Exchange and Cooperation

Considering that the majority of inter-Korean
exchange and cooperation projects continue passing

- A scene to put troops/ equipment

through land, sea and air routes within the military for demining
area involving the MDL and NLL, the ROK military
supports it through the evaluation of its military impact.
The volume of inter-Korean passage after January 2004 is


-----

Chapter Strengthening Future-oriented Defense Capabilities
4


indicated in Table 4-8. In the case of a volume of inter-Korean
passage by land (through the MDL, based on one way), the level of
more than 600 times in 2003 after the completion of provisional
roads on the Kyungeui and Donghae lines in December 2002,
rapidly increased to more than 3,200 times in 2004 and 5,000 times
in 2005. Along with the construction work of the Gaesung
complex, the number of transit persons during that period came to
reach approximately two million people. In this context, the
military is supporting consultation between the UNC and the North
Korean Military, escort and guard in relation to the
passage through inter-Korean administration area around
Kyungeui and Donghae lines.
The sea route passages were also averaging the passage
of 5 ships per day to transport materials between the
South and North before the “Inter-Korean Agreement on
Maritime Transport”came into force, and most ships were

- Loading into North Korean cargo ship of a third country’s nationality, such as China and

Panama. However, 150 North Korean ships in total
received the ROK government’s approval for maritime
transportation as of October 2006, and some 530 ROK
vessels per month on average also navigate into North
Korean waters.
Accordingly, the ROK military reviews permissions
regarding North Korean vessel’s sailing in ROK waters and

- North Korea's Koryo maintains surveillance during sailing and emergency
passenger plane preparedness posture.

Inter-Korean air transport continued to increase in
number of transports, after the first running, using provisional

impact, the ROK military reviews permissions regarding the interKorean aircraft transport scheme, and maintains air surveillance
and an emergency preparedness posture during the operation
Meanwhile, the ROK military has completed demining and
roadbed works in order to connect the inter-Korean railways/roads.
It has also carried out work to remove mines buried beneath the
power transmission lines in the Gaesung industrial complex at the
north of the civilian control line in 2006.
Thus, in the course of executing inter-Korean exchange and
cooperation projects, the military continues to make efforts to mitigate
inter-Korean military tension and to build confidence by virtue of a
variety of consultations and agreements between
inter-Korean military authorities and the contacts
made in the process of their implementation.
All the while, North Korea took a positive
stance toward military support in regard to
exchange and cooperation, while it showed a
passive attitude to consultation on pure military
issues such as military confidence building
measures. Therefore, taking into account the
security situation caused by North Korea’s nuclear

- Military support for roadbed

test and the trends of inter-Korean dialogue, the construction of the Kyeongeui Line
government will endeavor to push for the
mitigation of military tension and confidence
building to consult and execute the matters of military support for
inter-Korean exchange and cooperation, including the aggregate
collection project at the estuary of Han River and the joint antiflood project of the Imjin River, in addition to compliance with the
“Agreement on military assurance of the railways and roads
passage.”

Rapid changes in the security environment and the development of
high-tech weapons systems require defense manpower with stronger
capabilities and various specialties. Securing and managing such defense
manpower is the key to successfully exercising combat power.

The MND is improving its defense manpower structure to ensure a
civilian-centered decision and promotion of defense policies, as well as to
provide an environment for the military to devote itself to combat missions.
To accomplish these goals, the MND is implementing a scheme to expand
the civilian base, such as adjusting the end-strength of MND headquarters,
not to mention increasing the use of civilian personnel. The MND is also
promoting policies to strengthen officers’specialties and expend
opportunities for self-development.

In addition, the MND formulates and implements a wide array of
welfare promotion measures to improve the “quality of life”for service
members, with the intent to boost their enthusiasm and morale. In other
words, the MND is pursuing a dramatic enhancement of service
members’working conditions through the improvement of their salary
and allowance system, improvement of barracks facilities and residence
conditions, expansion of medical support, and improvement of living
conditions of service members’families. At the same time, the MND is
seeking to improve job security for military personnel, bolstering measures
to support the reemployment of retired military personnel and improve the
military pension system.

1. The Establishment of an Advanced Defense
Manpower Structure

A. The Strengthening of the Expertise of Public Officials
in the MND Headquarters

In the process of combining and arbitrating national security
and defense policies, not to mention deciding and promoting them
as well, the Minister of National Defense needs to be assisted in the
general perspective by those with neutral views and balanced


-----

Section 1. Retention and Management of Elite Defense Manpower

judgement. For the Minister of National Defense to be supported in
that way, the assignment and utilization of civilian experts in the
MND staff system is indispensible.
To accomplish this goal, the personnel structure in the MND
headquarters has been changed to ensure the civilian-centered
construction and promotion of defense policies so that national
security and defense policies can be effectively connected.
Furthermore, the civilian-centered formation and assignment of
positions in the MND headquarters are also done to efficiently
manage the military, as well as to secure the environment for the
military to devote itself to combat assignments exclusively.
However, the key to this personnel policy lies in not focusing
solely on increasing the number of civilians in senior positions in the
MND, but on training and properly using civilian experts within
defense policy and military management sectors. As such, the MND
intends to expand civilian expert officials working in the MND
headquarters and assign military officers to required positions in
order to transform and develop the personnel structure in which
civilian personnel with specialties and active military officers are well
harmonized. Considering the organization stability and the deed for
civilian experts, etc., the MND plans on increasing the limit of the
number of civilian officials in the MND headquarters with each year.
According to this adjusted number limit, 5 positions at the
director general level, such as the management director general of
legal affairs, the planning director general of personnel planning,
the planning director of military installations, the director general
of international cooperation, and the management director general
of public affairs, have been converted into general official positions
between 2005 and 2006. As of June 1, 2006, only 4 positions
among 15 director general positions, including the military policy
advisor, the director general of policy planning, the director
general of mobilization planning, and the director general of
logistics management, are occupied by active military officers.
Meanwhile, 10 positions among 68 team leader positions will
be converted into civil service positions by 2007, and 114 positions
in person-in-charge level, currently occupied by majors or
lieutenant colonels, will be converted into civil service positions by
2009.
As civilian official positions are gradually expanded in the MND
headquarters, the number of positions occupied by military office


-----

Chapter Establishment of an Advanced Defense Management System

will be reduced by optimal level. The promotion plan for the
adjustment of the official number limit in the MND headquarters is
shown in Table 5-1.

Expansion of Female Workforce Utilization The MND established the“ Women’s Defense Policy Team”in order to implement various female-oriented policies on behalf of the government and society. In the past, the MND’s policies have focused only on female soldiers. However, through the current team, the opportunity is provided to promote various new policies, intended for all women in the MND including female officials and military civilians. discussing the directions (May 2006) The current status of the female workforce utilization in the MND is as follows: the ratio of female officials to the total official number limit is about 33%, while the ratio of female military civilians to the total military civilian number limit is about 15%. Both ratios are increasing every year. The status of MND female workforce in 2006 is <Table 5-2> Status of MND Female Workforce in 2006 (Unit: number of persons) Classification Total Class 4~5 Class 6~7 Below Class 8|626||244|39||382|61||182|29|444||

presented in Table 5-2.
Furthermore, to expand the number of female service members
in the ROK Armed Forces continuously, the number of female
officers and non-commissioned officers (NCOs) will be increased
from 4,000 in 2006 to 11,600 by 2020. At that point, the ratio of
female officers to the total officer number limit will be increased
from 2.7% to 7%, while the ratio of female non-commissioned
officers from 1.7% to 5%. The annual plan for the expansion of the
number of women soldiers is presented in Table 5-3.

<Table 5-3> Expansion Plan (Draft) of Service Women by Year
(Unit: number of persons)

|Classification|Total|Army|Navy|Air Force|
|---|---|---|---|---|

|2015|8,853|5,983|1,308|1,562|
|2020|11,606|7,790|1,938|1,878|



※ Based on each Service's future force structure plan

To expand the number of female military personnel, each cadet
academy assigns 10% of the avalable positions to female
applicants, and each Service increases the number of recruitment
of female officers candidates graduating from civilian colleges. In
addition, each Service plans to recruit more female noncommissioned officers. Thus, in the target year of 2020, the
number of female soldiers will have expanded by about 2.8 times
compared to that in 2006.
The utilization of female military personnel is based on the
principle that “without consideration of gender, all soldiers
meeting the requirements for task execution be assigned to any
position and perform the same task in the time of either war or
peace.”However, the assignment of women soldiers to the
following units is restricted: regimental or lower level units of
ground close combat operation, units of special operation or
reconnaissance tasks, and units or positions in which the physical
requirements are inappropriate for most female soldiers.
Right now, female armed personnel are performing their tasks
successfully in various posts, including policy-related posts, major
commanders and staffs, fighter and helicopter pilots, battleship

crews, posts in special areas, and soldiers of overseas troops. The
total number of female dispatched troops is 60 as of 2006. In Western
Sahara, Afghanistan, and the Zaytun unit, they are doing their best to
accomplish assigned tasks in various areas such as combat posts (i.e.
platoon commanders, pilots, special unit posts, battleship crews) and
technical posts (i.e. weapon maintenance, air defense control).
According to the “Framework Act on Women’s Development”
(legislated on 2002), the MND has introduced and promoted the
“Evaluation System of Gender Influence”as the analytic tool of
military policies, planning to carry out this system extensively
within each Service.
In addition, for female military personnel to manage military
life and family life at the same time, the MND has improved various
laws and regulations related to the reinforcement of maternity
protection and pregnancy. Furthermore, the MND provides for
maternity leave, establishing and operating day-care facilities in
accord with military characteristics, not to mention educating
military personnel to expand men’s consciousness about maternity

protection. Through such activities, the MND has actively
promoted the expansion of service men’s gender equality
perception and women’s development activities.
To enhance the leadership of female military personnel, the
leadership program was also designed to command and train
female officers within each Service, along with female officials as
well as military civilians. The leadership program was cosponsored
with the leadership development center in Ewha Woman’s
University, held in the Korea Military Academy on July 2006. On
September 2006, as part of the 56th commemoration events of
women soldiers foundation, a networking event was held for all
female military personnel to enhance morale.

C. Expansion of Military Civilian Personnel Utilization

Under the military force reduction
currently promoted by the MND, military
officer positions in higher units (including
each service headquarters and combat
support units) that may be more efficiently
performed by civilian personnel will no
longer be filled by achieve military officers.
According to this plan, about 26,000
civilian positions in the military in 2006,

- Networking event of female military personnel (Sep. 6,

which is around 3.9% of the current military 2006)
force, will be increased to 30,000, about 6% of the military force of
2020. At the same time, the personnel management system for
civilians in the military will be improved. The appointment system
will be improved to secure excellent personnel, while open and
contracting positions will be expanded as well.
This expansion of civilian basis in the military is designed as a
response to security environment changes around the Korean
Peninsula, as well as to actively prepare the basis to accommodate
social changes and reforms.

2. Development of Military Human Resources

The ROK military has been carrying out various types of
educational training to accomplish the goal of “fostering best
military members to win against the enemy.”Through such


4


-----

Chapter Establishment of an Advanced Defense Management System
5

educational training, the foundation of today’s military capabilities
might be laid. Especially, as weapon systems have become highly
advanced and are based on information technology, the MND has
recognized that fostering excellent manpower and cultivating
military members’potentials are the cores of developing combat
strength. Consequently, the following tasks have been promoted
actively.

A. Improvement of the Military Educational Training System

In the past, the military educational training system was
classified into school education and unit education. But now, it has
been classified into military education, human resources
development and unit training to foster best military personnel and

cultivate their potentials.
Military education is divided into candidate training to train
civilians to become service members and refresher training to
improve military duty performance. Military educational institutions
provide this specialized military educational service. Human
resource development is divided into specialty education that
fosters the acquisition of specialized skills and supports the selfdevelopment of member of the military. Human resource
development utilizes various types of education systems, including
prominent domestic/offshore educational institutions and elearning. Unit training, the purpose of which nurtures unit and
military members’combat operation capabilities, is divided into
individual training and collective training. The conceptual diagram
is presented in Figure 5-4.

B. Development of Military Education

The ROK military has steadily made efforts to improve military
education so that many changes and developments have been
made.
To acquire excellent junior officers and strengthen military
infrastructure, the ROK military has improved the system to foster
officers, as well as non-commissioned officers under the ROTC
system. Especially, as the organization of the ROTC has been
authorized in 10 additional universities, the ROK military has
prepared the basis to secure elite officers from various regional
universities.
Furthermore, to develop the academic system of military
science as well as support professional personnel majoring in
military science, the degree of military science as a double major
has been conferred in military academies, with a master program of
military science being provided by the Korea National Defense
University. In order to improve the expertise of officials in the
MND headquarters, the Korea National Defense University has also
established specialist educational programs related to national
security policy, procurement, information technology, organization
and manpower. To strengthen the education of combined
operation capabilities, the ROK military has reviewed the curricula
of the Joint Staff College, service colleges, and military academies
and is currently setting up a combined educational system.

Especially, through mutual friendship and exchange activities,
military academies attempt to enhance understanding of other
military departments and expand the consensus.

C. Fostering Manpower with
Special Skills

To nurture field specialists initiating
military specialization and digitization,
various types of domestic/overseas training
and education programs are offered.
Degree-based education is intended to
foster military personnel who will be
utilized at educational institutes and
research departments. Every year, over 420
service members are selected for
enrollment in master and doctoral

- ROK-US military educational exchange council programs.

Overseas military education aims at acquiring advanced military
knowledge, fostering regional experts, and promoting cooperation
with allied countries. The ROK military sends about 400 service
members to major countries for study related to security and
defense industries. Especially since organizing the military
educational exchange council between the ROK and U.S. (March
2003), mutual cooperation has been strengthened by identifying
proper curricula, enhancing communication at working level, and
both countries’military educational development.
In addition, through an MOU other countries through contract,
the ROK military is strengthening cooperation military educational
exchange. In 2006, the ROK military discussed military educational
exchange cooperation in detail with Kazakhstan and Israel. To
reduce the language problems of foreign military trainees, the
Korean language course has been established in the Army
Intelligence School.

D. Civilian-Military Educational Exchanges

To enhance specialization, openness, and the diversity of
military education, exchanges and cooperation with civilian
educational institutes has been strengthened. The Korea National


-----

Section 1. Retention and Management of Elite Defense Manpower

Defense University and each Service have signed exchange
agreements with civilian universities and research institutes to
invigorate exchange activities, including mutual support of
professors, exchange of academic information, joint research
projects, and academic conferences.
Notably, according to the promotion of the military human
resources development policy, a military educational training
evaluation committee has been formed to have military educational
training courses acknowledged by the state. This committee
maintains a systematically cooperative relationship with the Korea
Educational Development Institute, Korea Job Competency
Development Institute, Korea University Education Council, and
Junior College Association. The ROK military has opened and
presently operates branches of civilian colleges (graduate schools)
within units to provide a better educational environment for military
officers, as well as to improve duty performance policies to promote
the development of Military Human Resources.

E. Promotion of the Military Human Resources
Development Policies

Soldiers who are attending colleges or have graduated from
colleges, comprise 82% of the ROK military servicemen, the highest
ratio in the world. The MND promotes military human resources
development policies at the governmental level in order to increase
combat capabilities as well as contribute to the expansion of the
knowledge base of both the nation and society by extensively
providing opportunities for self development to soldiers.
The main points of military human resources development
policies are as follows.
First, to provide a dynamic educational environment
during the duty service period, the MND supports a
program to improve soldiers’language abilities in their
free time by carrying forward a scheme where soldiers can
earn college credit through e-learning based on internet
computers installed at all military facilities; of course, these
credits earned in military educational training courses are
acknowledged by civilian educational institutions.

village in 2006. Furthermore, foreign lecturers, U.S. soldiers in the
ROK, and language resources in the ROK military have been
utilized for that purpose. In addition, 11 ROK Army branch schools
have been designated as educational institutes of which credits are
acknowledged. Technological schools and signal schools in the
Navy and Air Force have also been designated as model schools
for credit acknowledgement. Therefore, in the case of
technological servicemen, credits earned through military
educational programs can be acknowledged as college
credits
Second, to help soldiers earn college credits during the
military duty period as well as provide a learning
environment for servicemen’s self-development, the MND
provides various courses, such as languages, certificates,
college lectures, and cultural studies through “e-learning
portal for servicemen’s self-development,”which is

- Self-development learning
after daily work connected to cyber knowledge information rooms.

Third, to increase opportunities for military servicemen to
get further qualifications, the MND makes efforts to: a) expand the
exemption system for national technical qualification examination
requirements in terms of the military areas closely connected to
society; and b) help service members get national technical
qualifications for military techniques and capabilities to be usefully
utilized in the private sector.
Through these military human resources development polices,
the duty service period can be considered as a period of selfdevelopment for soldiers. The status of national technological
certificates acquired (1975~2005) is shown in Table 5-5.

Section 1. Retention and Management of Elite Defense Manpower

3. Improvement of Advanced Military Welfare
and Medical Support System

A. Improvement of Treatment for Service Members

(1) Improvement of the Salary System for Military Personnel

Though the “Military Personnel Remuneration Act”should be
applied to salary and allowance systems for military personnel,
military personnel are instead subject to the “Government
Employee Remuneration Regulations”and “Regulations on
Government Employee Allowance.”Thus, the unique nature of
military service has not been properly taken into account.

- Special environment
of military service


Considering the unique conditions that military personnel
face, including serving in remote and distant areas, frequently
moving, having difficulties regarding their children’s education,
early retirement, and difficulties in finding new jobs, the existing
“Military Personnel Remuneration Act”must be revised to reflect
reality. Hence, an independent compensation system is going to
be applied.
In future, military personnel’s salaries will be aimed above
the level of standard private companies, and the enactment of the
“Enforcement Decree of the Military Personnel Remuneration
Act”will be promoted to reflect an appropriate salary increase
rate.

Meanwhile, on the basis of a corporal, an enlisted man’s
monthly salary was increased to 65,000 won in 2006 (which was a
raise of 47% in 2006 as compared to 2005) and will be increased to
80,000 won in 2007, so that minimum expenses necessary during
the duty service period will be met.

(2) Improvement of the Allowance System
for Military Personnel

The MND plans to introduce various allowance systems
reflecting the unique working conditions and job specialties,
thereby improving the allowance system to ensure equality among
individual Services and branches.
In addition, to compensate for extra living expenses incurred
under a poor working conditions (i.e. serving in remote and distant
areas, a poor educational environment for the children, separation
from the family, frequent moving), the MND plans to introduce a
family separation allowance, a college student tuition support
allowance, a special medical service allowance, and a noncommissioned officer incentive allowance, as well as increase the
allowance to a realistic level. At the same time, considering high-risk
working incentive, the MND also plans to introduce independent
allowances, such as an allowance for special operation in contact
areas, an ambush allowance, and an outdoor billeting allowance.
Furthermore, the MND promotes tax exemption for allowances in
order to preserve household budgets (family allowance, residence
allowance, tuition support allowance).
Regarding the period of military education,
only 50% of the education period is
reflected in the salary class. However, the
MND’s goal is to fully reflect this period in
the salary class.

(3) Improvement of Food and
Clothing for Military Members

Not only to meet the divergent

Section 1. Retention and Management of Elite Defense Manpower

tastes of a new generation of soldiers but also to provide soldiers
with a nutritious diet by focusing on “quality”rather than
“quantity,”the ROK military promotes an increase of basic food
expenses as shown in Table 5-6. It plans to increase food expenses
to become 90% of civilian meal expenses by 2011.

<Table 5-6> Basic Food Expenses for Enlisted Men
(Unit: won per person/day)

|Civilian 5,877 6,024 6,175 6,360 6,551 6,747 In line with the trend of development in civilian clothing, the ROK military has gradually made military clothing more functional, making it lighter and better able to endure heat and cold. Moreover, both the maintenance of soldiers’dignity and convenience of tactical activities have been much improved. In particular, to be in conformity with the KS standard, the military clothing numbering system has been diversified like a commercial system to allow soldiers to wear clothing fitting their sizes. As shown in Table 5-7, according to the“ Five-Year Clothing Quality Improvement Plan,”the MND has improved combat shoes, summer combat uniforms, undershirts, and underwear. The MND plans to supply woolen socks, combat helmets, sports wear, and gloves with each new year-all product at a quality comparable to that of commercial products. <Table 5-7> Five-Year Clothing Quality Improvement Plan Classification 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010|5,877||6,024||6,175||6,360||6,551|||

B. Improvement of Barracks and Residence Environment

In accordance with the trend of social development, including
enhanced public awareness and living standards, not to mention
small and decrepit barracks, officers’residential facilities are being

improved in stages. Especially, considering the “quality of life”of
enlisted soldiers, barrack facilities are being improved drastically.
In consideration of the socio-cultural environment where military
men of a new generation are raised, the ROK military models barracks
on the type found in advanced countries. Per capita area for exclusive
use is being expanded from 0.7 Pyeong (1 Pyeong = 3.3058 m[2]) to 1.9
Pyeong, and the platoon-level consolidated non-bed type is improved
to the squad-level individual bed type. In 2006, 698.2 billion won was
invested in improving the integrated barracks of 144 Army battalions,
100 barrack buildings of GOP and coast/riverside guard units, and 134
barracks of the Navy and Air Force. According to the improvement
project, non-modernized and old barracks, as well as those located in
frontline areas, will be improved by 2010. Also, barracks of the
consolidated non-bed type already renovated will be replaced by
those with individual beds by 2015.
A total of 963.7 billion won has been invested in the
improvement of 16,540 officers’residential units that are 15
Pyeong or smaller, or 25 years old or more. However, there are
still 27,487 military households that qualify as decrepit and small
residential units, a number that comprises 34.5% of all military
households. The status of military residence based on construction
year and size is presented in Figure 5-8.
Those particular 27,487 military houses will be renovated or
constructed to national housing standard of 24~38 Pyeong or more
by 2011. Furthermore, 18,000 military houses will be constructed
through the Build-Transfer-Lease (BTL) method to improve military
housing conditions drastically.

quarters by allocating available financial resources by 2011 in order
to provide one residence for each applicable officer.

hospital (with research and educational functions), and its tasks
will be converted to the tentatively named “Armed Forces Central
Medical Center”of the ubiquitous type in the 21st century.

D. Improvement of the Living Conditions
of Service Members’Families

(1) Educational Support
for the Children of Service Members

Professional military personnel face serious constraints on their
children’s education, for their duties require them to work in
remote places, move frequently, and live apart from their families.
To alleviate these problems, the ROK military is pursuing a plan to
expand dormitories to house the children of service members and
increase opportunities for the children’s special admission to
universities.
Currently, 12 dormitories for the children of service members
(accommodating about 2,000 persons in total) are operating in 10
cities around the nation. In 2009, additional dormitories
accommodating over 400 persons will be built in Seoul.
The university special admissions system for service members’
children is currently being implemented at 62 universities in 2006.
The MND plans to expand the application of this system to more
universities based on their educational qualities and employment
prospects, so that more service members’children may benefit. In
addition, the MND provides road-shows to explain the entrance
examination to service members’children (as well as parents)
every year. The meeting materials are also posted on the internet
home page to provide relevant information.

(2) Provision of Incentives to Address the Problem
of Low Fertility

The MND considers the phenomenon of low fertility as a
national issue because a decrease in population signals a decrease
in economic activities; to combat this phenomenon, it promotes


-----

Section 1. Retention and Management of Elite Defense Manpower

various policies to encourage births. First of all, according to the
“MND Guide to Grant Incentives to have Children,”families with
multiple children are given top priority when moving into military
residence, assigned to spacious residence, preferential payment of
the rent fund, and benefits of using welfare facilities. Because of
these measures, the MND was recognized as a superior institute for
the promotion of child births in Korea by the “Committee on Ageing
Society and Population Policy.”In addition, personal affairs policies
for married military couples are being revised, and the “Veterans’
Pension Act”was revised to the effect that when a retirement
allowance is paid, the leave of absence period for
pregnancy and delivery is fully calculated into the period
of service.

(3) Recreational Facilities

Currently, the ROK military directly operates 9 central
recreational facilities. In addition, it holds 2,324
membership accounts in civilian condominiums and
intends on securing more than 100 additional accounts - Military recreational facility at

Seogwipo Condominium

every year.
In order to help professional service members enjoy their
leisure time and build up physical strength, the ROK military
currently has 29 sports centers. Three additional sport centers are
being built in the Gyeryongdae area, the aviation school, as well as
the Air Force’s Seosan Wing. Furthermore, a sports center at
Haenam (for the Navy), Osan, and the Sacheon Wing are planned
for construction or expansion.
In the future, based on the concept of a belt, the ROK military
will establish a set of recreational facilities (welfare centers,
recreational centers, condominium, sport centers, etc.) in major
tourist spots by region, to be available all year round.

E. Reinforcement of Employment Support
for Expectant Veterans

(1) Progress and Future Direction of Employment Support

Because retired service personnel released from the military are

“present service members’future,”support
for the stable reentry of these men into
society improves the morale of present
military service personnel, affecting the
strength of the military as a whole.
Thus, the MND and each Service
established a department taking exclusive
charge of veterans in 2003 and has actively
implemented employment support plans at
the whole military level.
The directions the employment support
policy are taking are: 1) expanding the range
of job slots open for members over 20 years in
service, both within and outside the military to
make employment more readily available; 2)

- Information & communication education
for officers to be discharged providing job guidance and counseling for

members over 10 years in service in order to
raise their employment competition abilities and help them compete
for limited job opportunities regarding military-related or civilian job
openings; and 3) providing job offerings and employment
information to members under 10 years of service to support
employment conditions.
Based on this employment support policy, the hiring of
knowledgeable and militarily experienced veterans as full-time
instructors in military education institutes, not to mention experienced
training veterans as scientific training instructors is expanding. Also,
the increse of the range of civilian occupations in the military sphere,
such as management staff of military welfare facilities, reserve force
commanders, employees of military-related organizations, etc. is
actively being promoted, as seen in Figure 5-9 below.

(2) Strengthening of Job Guidance and Education System

Various education programs are implemented to improve
employment competitiveness of impending veterans. Especially,
customized job guidance programs for specific occupations are
developed to vastly improve employment chances.
Through the creation of several customized education programs
directly related to an occupation, such as building manager,
guidance counselor, logistic manager in harbors, small and
medium enterprise site manager, administrator, and Chinese
instructor, employment rates are increasing. Furthermore, through
various commissioned education programs in professional institutes
and private institutes indirectly related to employment,
employment capabilities are strengthened. Lately, through the
military, industry, and academy agreement, the pursuit of


5


-----

Chapter Establishment of an Advanced Defense Management System

customized vocational education required by business
is active in order to raise employment rates and
improve technical job skills.
Also, to conveniently provide information to
remote and distant unit service members, an
education tour process operated starting from 2006.
For soon to be discharged service members, an
employment and establishment exposition is held
(every May and October), a job offer and hunting day
activated to not only provide various information but
also to induce hiring and employment counseling on
the spot. Therefore, employment support activities
are strongly promoted.
Through the “MND Job-Seeking Support Center,”
a military employment information system has been
structured to: a) present more pertinent and varied
education, b) present employment and business star-tup

includes interaction with the business personnel supervisor and
email contacts for various CEOs to arrange employment.
Advertisements using military buses, regular military satellite TV,
etc. are also actively involved. A military job guidance and
education system is shown below in Figure 5-11.

F. Improvement of the Military Pension System

(1) Characteristics of the Military Pension System

The military pension system, which had been operating under
the “Public Officials Pension Act”(enacted on January 1, 1960),
was separated from the Act on January 2, 963 due to the unique
characteristics of military duty.
The purpose of the military pension system is to stabilize the
livelihood and enhance the welfare of veterans as well as their
bereaved families. The system pays an appropriate amount of
money when military personnel retire due to age, physical/mental
disability, death, or medical treatment for any disease or injury
incurred in the line of duty. This system is a strong manifestation of
national compensation, in addition to that of social insurance and
living security.
The reason for having this system in place is that military
personnel must fulfill their missions even at the cost of their lives in
order to safeguard the nation and protect the lives and property of
the people. The life of military personnel is seriously restricted for
reasons such as emergency standby, operation and exercise, and
frequent moving. If they fail to be promoted, mandatory retirement
is inevitable at the age of 45 to 56, when the outlay typically
reaches the peak in life. Reemployment prospects after retirement
are limited since the military knowledge they have accumulated
during active duty is hardly compatible with civilian occupations.
These characteristics of military duty are accommodated by the
system.

(2) Improvement of the System for Financial Stabilization

The military pension fund has suffered deficits since 1973. As a
result, the government has compensated for these deficiencies. The


5


-----

Chapter Establishment of an Advanced Defense Management System
5

reason for such shortages is that the numer of pension beneficiaries
increased when an appropriate level of funding had not yet been
secured during the early phases of implementing the military
pension system. Under the military pension system, beneficiaries
are eligible for pension without paying contributions for the period
preceding the enactment of the “Veterans’Pension Act.”For those
who fought in wars such as the Korean War and the Vietnam War,
the number of days in combat was tripled when calculating the
amount of pension without additional financial support from the
government. Because of early retirement under the unique
characteristics of military duty, the beneficial period of military
pensioners is relatively longer than those of other pension
beneficiaries. Consequently, the government revised the
“Veterans’Pension Act”to redress deficits within the military
pension fund and stabilize the pension finance. As part of such
efforts, the government revised the “Veterans’Pension Act”in
2000, increasing the proportion covered by individuals and the
state from 7.5% to 8.5% as shown below in Table 5-12.

<Table 5-12> Increase of Coverage Rates by Individuals and the State

|Classification|1963|1970|1996|1999|2001|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Coverage Rate (%)|3.5|5.5|6.5|7.5|8.5|



In addition, instead of active duty compensation increase rates,
the fluctuation rates of the consumer price index were applied in
raising military pensions. The government also changed the basis
for calculating the amount of pension from the compensation
earned in the last month of military service to the average monthly
compensation for the three years preceding retirement.
Furthermore, in the case of a budget shortfall of the military
pension fund, the government ensures that it is covered by the
national treasury. In addition, the government legislated the
accumulation of a legal reserve. Through such institutional devices,
the government has laid the foundation for stabilizing the fund.
Moreover, a new information system for military pensions has been
developed and serviced since May 2006 to provide various pension
related information to military pensioners.
The means testing system (in which a part of the pension
within a half of the pension is suspended for payment for


-----

Section 1. Retention and Management of Elite Defense Manpower

pensioners who have incomes over a certain amount of money)
has been in operation since November 2006. This system is
expected to help stabilize fund financing. The status of pensioners
by year is presented in Figure 5-13.

The change in the environment of MND resource management, such
as the increase in maintenance expenses based upon the concentration
and diversification of the weapons system, calls for a progressive change
in logistics areas.

Thus, to improve the ROK military’s logistics support abilities, the
structuring of a user and duty-centered integrated logistics information
system is necessary. Specifically, to eliminate the causes of dispute and
lowered quality, competitive procurement is promoted as much as
possible. In addition, to allow the utilization of allied countries' resource
abilities in times of emergency to secure logistics support, advancing the
allied logistics support system, as well as concluding interactive logistics
support pacts with the third countries providing international logistics
cooperation, are crucial.

Meanwhile, the efficiency of the MND management can be raised with
the active usage of civilian resources in simple support duties and areas in
which civilians hold a competitive advantage. By introducing competitive
principles and civilian management techniques into the combat service
support areas, an efficient and high-quality service can be provided
through a military executive agency who accomplishes the efficiency of
defense management

1. Efficient Use of Defense Resources

Lately, in the area of logistics resource management, three
environmental changes worth noting have occurred. First, the
demand of advanced logistics resource management based upon
future war patterns; second, the construction of an integrated
information system in logistics resource areas based upon latest
information technology; and third, a quantified objective
assessment on logistics support performance, etc.
In order for our military to effectively react according to
environmental changes and achieve innovative performance,
logistics assets must be openly accounted for and an integrated

Section 2. Reform of Defense Resource Management

logistics information system established for effective operational
support. While reforming defense procurement methods, which
are a major cause of internal disputes, the MND is focusing on
developing a user-centered performance index and building up the
performance management system to promote the efficient
management of defense resources.

A. Construction of Integrated Logistics Information System

The MND is promoting an evolutionary information system
centered around the user and mission by visibly accounting for all
the Services’logistics resources and applying the latest information
technology to innovatively improve the logistics support
capabilities. Seen in Figure 5-14, the first stage is producing a
functional information system through the development of an
equipment maintenance and transport information system as well
as improving the efficiency of the deteriorating ammunition and
material information system by 2008. The second stage is
constructing a singular integrated logistics information system by
combining materials, ammunition and equipment maintenance in
order to strengthen the link between the internal and external
logistics systems by 2014.

From 2005, in order to continually account for logistics supplies
and goods, ubiquitous technology including the RFID has been
applied to ammunition maintenance as a model for others.
Moreover, to enhance the united logistics support capabilities
between the ROK and U.S., the RFID based G-ITV (Global In
Transit Visibility) experimental system is underway.

B. Expansion of the Competition in Defense Procurement

To resolve the issues of cost overruns or low quality goods in
negotiated contracts, the MND is promoting a gradual expansion in
competition by dividing group negotiated contract items by “those
items by small-to-medium enterprises”and “other contracts items.”
“Group negotiated contract items by small-to-medium
enterprises”are to be procured by more competitive methods in
accordance with government policy. In 2006, model categories
(such as clothing, foods) were elected for competitive contracts to
be offered to small to medium enterprises, a practice soon to be
implemented in all aspects from 2007. “Other negotiated contact
items”are subject to gradual change to competitive contracting
from the years 2008 to 2020 through the MND’s plans, aiming to
reduce associated organizational and company conflicts.

C. Establishment of a Performance Management System
of Logistics Support

In current logistics support units, possession rates of
approved stock items, supply rates, and stock exhaustion rates
have been used as methods to confirm logistics activities in
terms of the supplier (logistics support unit) rather than the
user (combat unit). Consequently, the improvement of the
logistics preparedness has been difficult to quantitatively
measure.
To mitigate this problem, the MND is establishing a
performance management system which develops and utilizes


RFID:
Radio Frequency Identification


-----

Section 2. Reform of Defense Resource Management

performance indices based upon the user. This system involves
quantitatively measuring the supplier’s logistics activities. The
status of performance indices based upon the user is presented in
Table 5-15 below.

<Table 5-15> Status of User-Centered Logistics Performance Indices

The time needed for the user to

|Requirement|Demand Estimation Accuracy|
|Procurement|Procurement Lead Time|
|Supply|Requisition Waiting Time|
||Inventory Level|
||Meal Satisfaction|
||Clothing Satisfaction|
|Maintenance|Repair Cycle Time (RCT)|


With the establishment of the logistics support performance
management system, logistics preparedness and user satisfaction
can be drastically increased. In addition, logistics assets can be
efficiently operated and budgets savings realized.
To promote this, the MND developed the performance indexes
from 2005 to 2006, reflecting the characteristics of each Service,
and will experimentally apply performance indexes after
establishing performance management systems in each Service
during 2007-2008. After 2009, these measures will be expanded to
encompass the whole military.

2. Strengthening of International
Logistics Cooperation


International logistics cooperation is
strengthened in order to guarantee stable
logistics support through the use of allied
countries’security support capabilities in case of
emergency. According to security environmental
changes between the ROK and U.S., while
developing the combined logistics support

-----

Chapter Establishment of an Advanced Defense Management System

system on a more comprehensive and future-orientated basis, the
expansion of pragmatic logistics exchange cooperation, such as
mutual logistics support pacts and military supplies transfer with
the third country, is underway.

A. Logistics Cooperation with the U.S.


The ROK military, in preparation for the abolition of the CRDL
(at the end of 2004) and the completion of the WRSA program for
allies, is searching for ways to firmly maintain the combined
logistics preparedness and is preparing for the transfer negotiation
of the WRSA. Furthermore, in case of emergency, the ROK and
U.S. joint training is put into action to continually supplement and
develop wartime support schemes so that additional U.S. troops
entering the peninsula can be quickly deployed.
Moreover, for an environmentally friendly disposal of waste
ammunition in the ROK, an incinerator was provided among
ammunition demilitarizing facilities in June 2006 in Yeongdonggun, Chungcheongbuk-do.
In the meantime, the large scale exchange of the existing TKP for
SNP in April 2005, for the USFK’s oil transportation, has reduced oil
leaks and restrictions on private property rights to a large degree.

B. Logistics Cooperation with the Third Country

The ROK’s international status has been raised, resulting in a
continual increase of varied logistics cooperation with third
countries. Thus, mutual logistics support pacts with Thailand and
Australia have been completed, and pacts with Turkey, Philippines,
New Zealand, etc. are being pursued. Furthermore, military
supplies, such as naval vessels and planes, have been transferred
from Philippines, Bangladesh, Kazakhstan, etc., while the transfer of
military goods with other countries as part of defense industrial
cooperation is also being investigated.

Section 2. Reform of Defense Resource Management

3. Expansion of Civilian Contracts
in the Resource Management Area

A. Gradual Expansion of Civilian Contracts

At the moment, the ROK military is enforcing civilian contracting in
only certain parts of the military, such as the management of facilities,
cleaning and gardening. However, the importance of civilian
contracting is to take a larger role in the future. In the resource
management area, utilizing civilian contracts in roles such as
supporting simple work and areas in which civilians hold an
advantage is expected to raise the efficiency of defense management.
Therefore, areas which do not relate directly to combat and
military operations and can easily be undertaken by civilians, such
as vehicle repairing, managing welfare facilities and officer’s
cafeteria, establishment and installation, cleaning, gardening,
laundering, hair cutting, repairing combat boots, and environmental
beautification, will be increasingly contracted out to civilians. From
2007, a detailed scheme will be followed step-by-step. The scheme
for civilian contract targets and yearly plan is as Figure 5-16 below.

<Figure 5-16> Promotion Plan for Civilian Contracting

B. Fair Selection and Management
of Civilian Contract Enterprises

Civilian contract enterprises are selected by objectively setting a
standard based upon management results of the requirements, the
enhancement of production, and the cutting down of expenses,
and civilian contract enterprise information is systematically
managed through a database. Also, detailed civilian contract work
content, cost calculation method and payment conditions, the
opening and conclusion of contract length, and conditions for
cancellation are to be maintained in an exact and fair manner.
Through setting conditions, such as the duty to notify beforehand,
establishment of provisional contract length for the continuation of
work, and testing abilities of the enterprise, the appropriate
selection of an enterprise can be made fairly. Also, stable service in
case of emergency will be promoted.

C. Preservation of Security and Achievement
of Missions during Wartime or Emergent States

In order to ensure the smooth completion of combat missions,
concluding detailed contracts on civilian contract enterprises'
wartime and ordinary duties, and setting up emergency preparation
training plans are necessary. Then, training and assessment need to
be enforced. In light of the possible strike of civilian contract
enterprises and disconnection of service, maintenance of related
laws and ordinances, and countermeasures are to be prepared.
To preserve security and prevent the leak of military information
outside, a detailed provision on maintaining secrecy is to be
included in the contract, and security inspections along with
security education are to be continually implemented in civilian
contract enterprises.

4. Selection and Management
of Military Executive Agency

In the area of combat duty support, competition principles and


-----

Section 2. Reform of Defense Resource Management

civilian management techniques are to be introduced.
Organizations that can raise the efficiency of defense management
will be appointed as a military executive agency. The publicly
hired agency chief is granted the right to control personnel,
organization and finance in order to continually enable progress for
an organization that provides efficient and high-quality service.
A military executive agency, unlike the simple procedure of
openly selecting a commanding officer previously appointed as the
officer of active duty and changing the expertise of the
organization’s external and internal side, is also granted the right of
unit management to manage the unit in ways never done before,
modernizing into an organization with both flexibility and
professionalism.

A. Promotion Plan

The promotion plan for the military executive agency, including
the management system diagram, is the same as Figure 5-17.
Maintenance depot, supply depot, data processing facility,
printing depot, installation field, and welfare bodies must be
assessed for performance. Units that can be assessed for
performance, and perform duties requiring enforcement and
business acumen will be targeted as the military executive agency
from 2007 to 2012, and the number of units appointed will be
gradually expanded.
For the appointment of the military executive agency, a target
unit has to be confirmed and all related areas discussed to form a
consensus. A perfected system will perceive the problems
beforehand, having selection standards of the target unit
established and a selected committee, including a civilian expert,
created in order to carefully appoint the target unit.

B. Promotion of Enactment
of the “Military Executive Agency Act”

In July 2006, a public hearing for the enactment of the system
for the military executive agency was held in which the ideas and
thoughts of military personnel and civilian were heard. In the
proposed “Military Executive Agency Act.”the hiring of the agency
chief following public recruitment procedures, the agency chief’s
self-regulated rights in personnel, organization and finance, the
progress agreement contract and progress assessment method, the
appointment of the military executive agency and conditions set for
management, and the installation of an operation council and
committee will be stipulated.


-----

Section 2. Reform of Defense Resource Management

C. Management and Experimental Introduction
of the Military Executive Agency

In 2007, three units will be experimentally run as military
executive agencies in order to minimize problems associated with
system operation. Furthermore, the MND is going to ensure the
appropriateness and reliability of the performance assessment by
quantifying performance indexes, which is based on policy studies
of target units. Also, a fair assessment council including civilian
experts, will be set up to assess the progress of the commanding
officer. Moreover, yearly progress assessment reports will be made.
Progress enhancement workshops will commence so that the
military executive agency is naturally able to perfectly complete
missions in wartime and ordinary situations, while providing a faster
and higher-quality service than now.

The appropriate defense budget is achieved by balancing the
requirements of military power commensurate to security threats and the
nation’s financial capability. Within a systematically connected system
through the “defense planning management system”(planning-
programming-budgeting-execution-assessment system), the MND makes
efforts not only to secure an appropriate defense budget, but also to
allocate available resources to efficiently support the requirements of
military power.

1. Stable Securing of an Appropriate Defense Budget

A. Trend of Defense Budget Allocation

The ratios of defense expenditures to GDP and the government
budget have changed in line with changes in the security and
social environment. As shown in Figure 5-18, until the early 1980s,
the ratios of defense expenditure to GDP and government budget
stood at 5% to the GDP and 30% to the government budget
respectively, as the MND had steadily promoted projects such as
“Yulgok project”since the 1970s to build up military strength for
self-reliant defense. But from the late 1980s, the defense budget
has been on a downward trend until the early 2000s because of the
increasing demand for social welfare, as well as the IMF financial
crisis from 1997-1998. However, an upward trend for the military
budget was established by the Participatory Government to
promote “cooperative self-reliant defense.”As a result, the defense
budget is 2.6% of the nation’s GDP and 15% of the government
budget, as of 2006.

B. Defense Expenditures Commensurate
with Security Circumstances

It is desirable that an appropriate defense budget be reached by
balancing military requirements commensurate with security threats
and the nation’s financial capability. However, the “security threat
environment”has priority in the allocation of defense budget, for
national defense is based on the primary goal of securing national
survival. In particular, countries either in a direct military
confrontation with enemies, such as the ROK and Israel, or with
imminent security threats must decide defense expenditures
proportional to their “security threat level.”
Viewed in this light, even though the ROK is at the top of the
“security threat level,”as shown in Table 5-19 the allocation of
resources for national defense remains lower than other countries
facing disputes and confrontations.


A new concept of GDP:
An inter-industry relation table
(standard, index) has been
expanded according to
changes in GDP basic year
from 1995 to 2000. As an
accounting standard has been
converted to "93 SNA," a
requirement of an international
organization, new projects and
social overhead capital have
been reflected additionally.
(Generally 10~15% increase
relative to the existing GDP)

SNA (System of National
Accounts):
An accounting standard and
system to summarize the
results of economic entities'
activities as well as the assets
and liabilities status of the
national economy.

2. 2006 Defense Budget

A. General Account Budget

The amount and functional allocation of the FY 2006 defense
budget are presented in Table 5-20 and Figure 5-21.

|<Table 5-20>|Defense Budget for FY 2006|Col3|Col4|Col5|(Unit: billion won)|Col7|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Classification|FY2005 %||FY2006 %||Increase/ Decrease %||
|Total Defense Expenditure|21,102.6|100.0|22,512.9|100.0|1,410.3|6.7|
|DCI Costs|7,298.7|34.6|7,499.4|*33.3|200.7|2.7|

|Project Costs|5,209.1|24.7|5,816.8|25.8|607.7|11.7|



※Ratio changes after the transfer to DAPA (Ordinary Operating Costs : 66.7→74.2%, DCI Costs :
33.3→25.8%)
※MND Budget (Ordinary Operating Costs)
: 15.0→16.7 trillion won, DAPA Budget (DCI Costs) : 7.5→5.8 trillion won
※Expenditures that are not closely connected with force reinforcement in existing categories are
listed under MND Ordinary Operating Costs, including a share of defense expense, costs for
relocating US forces in Korea, and repair/parts spending. Operating costs of DAPA and subsidiary
agencies are classified as DCI costs.


The defense budget for FY 2006 concentrates on the
reinforcement of self-reliant defense capabilities and the
improvement of soldiers’morale as well as welfare in line with the
promotion of the “Defense Reform 2020.”Financial resources
earmarked for national defense amount to 22.5129 trillion won, up
6.7% from the figure of 21.1026 trillion won (including the revised
supplementary budget of 280 billion won) in 2005. Such an amount
comprises 15.3% of the government budget and 2.6% of GDP.
The allocation for Defense Capacity Improvements totaled
7.4994 trillion won, up 2.7% from FY 2005. The DCI allotment
reflects requirements to secure self-reliant defense capabilities and
core combat capabilities, including K1A1 tanks, new 155mm selfpropelled artillery, 7,000 ton-class destroyers, 1,800 ton-class
submarines, F-15K fighters, and AWACS.
To maximize existing combat capabilities, it reflects several
costs, such as the costs of package requirements (including K-9
armored ammunition carriers), equipment upgrades (including F

Defense Capacity
Improvement:
Until now, terms of
investments for force
reinforcement had been used
differently, such as "Force
Improvement," "Force
Investment," and "Defense
Capacity Improvement," in line
with changes of categories.
However, with the inauguration
of the Defense Acquisition
Program Administration
(DAPA), DAPA budget means
"Defense Capacity
Improvement." Therefore, the
same term, DCI, applies to the
following.

5E/F), and aging vehicle replacement requirements (including
portable antiaircraft missiles). Ammunition reserves and equipment
maintenance costs are also allocated to improve warfare
sustainability capabilities and operation rates. In addition, it
focuses on the expansion of R&D investment regarding core
weapons systems, including Korean helicopters and nextgeneration tanks.
Ordinary operational costs rose to 15.135 trillion won, an increase
of 8.8% from 2005. Such expenses mainly reflect the cost of enhancing
service members’morale and welfare based on creating quarters
furnished with individual beds, securing BOQs, increasing enlisted
soldiers salaries & medical fees during vacation periods, and newly
introduced expenses for commanding activities of squad leaders.
In addition, such expenses reflect the increased budget for
purchasing fuel for equipment operation and securing necessary
training grounds to maintain combat readiness and capabilities.
The expenses also take into account financial resources required to
expand environmental preservation facilities and relocate civilian
houses near ammunition dumps. These efforts are to promote
public convenience and to reflect the financial requirements for the
enforcement of special laws aimed at providing compensation to
personnel who performed special operations.

B. Special Account Budget

There are four special account budgets under the MND’s
control: Special Accounts for Military Pensions, Special Accounts
for National Property Management, Special Accounts for Executive
Agency, and Special Accounts for Relocating USFK Bases. The
amount and allocation of the Special Accounts Budget for 2006 is
presented in Table 5-22.

<Table 5-22> Status of Special Account Budget for FY-2006
(Unit: 100 million won)

|Classification|FY2005|FY2006|Increase/ Decrease|%|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Special Accounts for Military Pensions|16,608|17,747|1,139|6.9|
|Special Accounts for National Property Management|6,792|3,114|△3,678|△54.2|
|Special Accounts for Executive Agency|297|261|△36|△12.1|
|Special Accounts for Relocating USFK Bases|-|6,264|-|-|



Revenues for the Special Accounts for Military Pensions are used
to pay out pensions to retired military personnel. The Special
Accounts for Military Pensions for FY 2006 were increased to 1.7747
trillion won, up 6.9% from the previous year to reflect the increase
in pension recipients as well as the rise of consumer prices and the
rate of improving treatments in 2005.
Revenues to fund the Special Accounts for National Property
Management are spent on relocating military facilities to rural areas
and purchasing private land that the military is currently using. In
order to settle civil petitions, the Special Accounts for National
Property Management for FY 2006 set aside 311.4 billion won for
relocating 30 military facilities and purchasing private land that
military units currently use.
The Special Accounts for Executive Agency was created to
ensure that the Defense Agency for Public Information Services
serves as an executive agency that pursues the public interest with
enhanced independence and efficiency in terms of operation. For
FY 2006, 26.1 billion won was allocated to these accounts to fund


-----

Section 3. Efficient Allocation and Execution of Defense Budget

the production of newspapers, broadcasting programs, movies, as
well as military satellite television broadcasting.
The Special Accounts for Relocating USFK Bases is a new
budget account to merge and relocate USFK bases to Pyeongtaek
or other places. For FY 2006, 626.4 billion won was allocated to
purchase land and construct facilities.

3. 2007~2011 Mid-Term Defense Plan

A. Focus and Scale of the Mid-Term Defense Plan

To promote the first stage of the “Defense Reform 2020,”the
“2007~2011 Mid-Term Defense Plan”was formulated to mainly
reflect the requirements for self-reliant war deterrence and
advanced defense management. Under the plan, 150.7499 trillion
won was allocated, maintaining the average increasing rate of 9.9%
per year.
The portion of Improvements in Defense Capabilities that
stands at 25.8% (based on the budget transferred to Defense
Acquisition Program Administration) of the total defense budget as
of 2006 will be gradually increased to 35.9% by 2011.

B. Planned Programs by Area

(1) Defense Capacity Improvements

Defense Capacity Improvements aim to ensure self-reliant war
deterrence and establish the combat force infrastructure for
national defense. Consequently, DCIs place the focus on: a)
securing independent surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities,
b) building a battlefield management system to integrate combat
capabilities, c) securing military strength to prepare for unspecified
future threats, d) reinforcing the existing force, and e)
strengthening domestic R&D capabilities as well as the
infrastructure of the defense industry.
The allocation for research and development will be annually
increased to actively promote the independent development of


-----

Chapter Establishment of an Advanced Defense Management System
5

advanced weapons systems for which the ROK is currently reliant
on advanced countries and to develop core technologies according
to evolving future battlefield environments. In addition, these
accounts will facilitate an open R&D in association with
developments in national scientific technology.

(2) Ordinary Operational Expenses

To establish an advanced defense management base and new
military culture in the barracks, ordinary operational expenses
focus primarily on improving soldiers’morale and welfare,
enforcing defense digitization and scientific defense management,
fostering elite soldiers, improving the existing combat force's
operation and maintenance, preserving the environment, and
enhancing public convenience. (See Table 5-23.)
To boost morale and promote the welfare of soldiers, enlisted
men’s monthly salaries were raised to a realistic level. Besides,
these expenditures reflect requirements to improve the aged
integrated barracks of 260 battalions and 1400 residential facilities
as well as to modernize the 3 military hospitals
For the purpose of nurturing high-quality human resources and
enhancing the maintenance as well as operation of the existing
combat force, the ROK military will expand domestic/overseas
commissioned education, not to mention local/wide area
networks. In addition, the compensation for reserve force training
will be provided.
Regarding environmental preservation and public interest
protection, ordinary operational expenses include the installation costs
of environmental preservation facilities (i.e., sewage/wastewater
disposal plant, soil contamination prevention facilities). Also, these
allotments reflect the requirements of a safe zone around ammunition
dumps and special laws to provide compensation to personnel who
performed special operations.

※Based on the DAPA budget.


In a bid to secure the financial resources for defense reform, the
MND will make every effort to reflect combat force requirements
decided through the “defense planning management system”to the
Mid-Term Defense Plan. At the same time, it will try to include the
resources requirement of the Mid-Term Defense Plan within the
national fiscal management plan, which is a governmental midterm plan.
In line with the changing security environment, the ROK
military will examine which weapon system has the priority, when
is the right time to incorporate the system into force capabilities,
and how investments are concentrated on the most important
projects through budget reallocations to utilize the defense budget
efficiently within the limited defense resources.


National Fiscal
Management Plan:
The "National Fiscal
Management Plan" have
become legally effective since
Jan. 1, 2007 through the
"National Finance Act."
Therefore, this plan should be
used as basic reference when
drawing up budgets.

Defense digitization aims at enhancing military capabilities by
automating command/control systems and battlefield management. In
addition, it pursues the realization of defense management and operation
of low-expense as well as high-efficiency based on the digitization and
electronic transactions of defense resource management. To achieve
these goals, the MND is promoting an expansion of digitization
infrastructure, linking the defense digitization with government policies and
digitization education.

1. Digitization of Battlefield Management

The digitization of battlefield management, based on the concept
of future battlefield, aims at setting up a battlefield management
system that is able to integrate and operate all components of
combat force, such as ISR, command/control system, and PGM. The
promotion of the digitization of battlefield management is divided
into three parts: the command/control system, the military
intelligence system, and the modeling & simulation system.

A. Command/Control System


The conceptual diagram of battlefield management is described
in Figure 5-24 below. The Joint Chiefs of Staff have operated the
CPAS, which was developed to automate the major combat force,
command post functions of operational units, and enable
transmission/receipt of telegraphic messages to and from tactical
units under their command. Furthermore, since 2004, the JCS has
developed the KJCCS, an upgraded form of the CPAS, which will
be established with the aim of interoperability with tactical C4I
systems of the individual Services by 2007.
The army tactical C4I system, called ATCIS, was built to
automate the battlefield function of tactical echelons of the corps or
subordinate level. System capacity will be upgraded, and the
number of targeting units will be also expanded by 2009.

Section 4. Pursuit of Defense Digitization


The naval tactical C4I system, called KNCCS, based on the existing
KNTDS, will be established centered on the operation headquarters to
enable command/control of integrated naval operations by 2007. The
system is scheduled to be delivered to all units by 2010.
An air-combat tactical C4I system will be developed by 2007 in
order to support aerial operations, including the identification of
current situations, decision-making by commanders and personnel of
each operational echelon, and the consideration of interoperability
with the existing TACC and MCRC.

B. Military Intelligence System

MIMS is an automated military intelligence system integrating
the intelligence functions of individual Services (and each echelon)
and ensuring the distribution as well as sharing of military
intelligence by all Services on a real-time basis. It is scheduled to
develop an application system that will enable inputting, saving,
searching, and distributing by 2008, as well as to also establish
hardware like a basic communication network by 2010.

C. Modeling & Simulation System

The MND is building a simulation system that allows for the

analysis of military principles, battlefield management concepts,
unit structures, and operational plans appropriate for future
warfare. Based on such efforts, the MND is also establishing a
decision-making and R&D simulation system that supports
analysis and assessment for each stage of weapons system
acquisition.
The ROK military has developed and operated several training
models for each echelon, including “Taegeuk JOS”(the three
Services joint training model of the Joint Chiefs of Staff), and
“Changjo 21”(the training model for division and corps-level units
of the ROK Army). The naval and air-combat forces have each
been developing “Cheonghae”and “Changgong.”In addition, the
MND is pursuing the expansion of the training simulation system
applicable to the JCS, individual Services, each echelon and each
battlefield function.
The MND already set up the battalion-level KCTC in 2005 to
help troops accumulate indirect warfare experience in simulated
battlefield environments, which is improving soldiers’capability to
adopt to battlefield conditions as well as their combat capabilities.

2. Resource Management Digitization

The function and composition of resource management system
digitization are presented in Figure 5-25.
Resource management digitization is divided into four
functional categories, namely budgeting/accounting, planning
/personnel management, logistics/procurement, and eadministration. Performance-based digitization investment and
evaluation are promoted on the basis of EA. In addition, it builds
up an integrated defense budget information system linking
national and defense financial information for the efficient
operation and management of defense resources. Finally, the MND
is promoting digitization of resources using ubiquitous-based
technologies.

A. Blueprint Plan of Defense Information Technology.

The MND is pushing ahead with the establishment of EA on all
Service levels, which will be utilized to clear up any obscurity of
digitization requirements, prevent double investments in
digitization project, and integrate information systems. EA
development was initiated for the MND in 2006 and will be
completed for all the Services by 2009. At the same time, the MND
is working on EA development for the battlefield management
system, which has been running as a model since 2004.
The EA, a blueprint of defense information technology, will be
an architecture base of individual Services and related groups in
alignment with a governmental level EA. In future, the
requirements of digitization projects will be requested, controlled
and assessed based on the architecture of each group,

B. Digitization Support through Resource Digitization

The MND is digitizing entire resources in various ways. It also
plans to establish a defense integrated administration reform
system associated with a government-promoted electronic
administration, defense integrated finance information system
connected with the national finance information service, and


EA:

information resource management system.
Regarding the defense integrated administration reform system,
the MND will improve the existing electronic decision system and
military portal system, ultimately supplementing these systems with
a performance management system, service management system,
and knowledge management system. The core system of the
defense integrated system became incorporated into force
capabilities in 2006 and will be upgraded step by step by 2010.
The integrated defense finance information system is designed
to work with double-entry bookkeeping and accrual basis
accounting in accordance with the reform of the government
accounting system. Through this system, it is possible to share
information through the digital accounting and budget system, as
well as establish the transparency of budgeting connected with the
defense resource management information system. The BPR/ISP
projects in the development plan for the defense integrated finance
information system were completed in the first half of 2006, and
the core system is developing now.
The information resource management system is promoted to
develop core technology and apply it to units at the level of a
division/brigade or higher in 2008. It will be gradually expanded in
stages to all of the Services that have information resources from 2009. As
a method of resource digitization, the MND will make full use of
ubiquitous-based technologies, including agent software automatically
collecting information of the PC and RFID for defense digitization.
Digitization of logistics resources based on universally available
technologies enables the automatic collection of logistics and
procurement information. It also improves the efficiency of related
operations to effectively manage collected information. In efforts to
carry out logistics-related services through the digitization of
logistics resources, the project for upgrading ammunition and
materials information systems will be initially undertaken from 2007
to 2008. The equipment maintenance information system will be
developed by 2008 as well as utilized in alignment and interface
with logistics-related systems.

Section 4. Pursuit of Defense Digitization

3. Promotion of the Digitization Environment

A. Expansion of Digitization Infrastructure


Digitization infrastructure consists of an information and
communication network, computer systems, and information
protection systems.
The information and communication network based on BTL
will be set up at the level of an independent company by 2008. In
order to accomplish this project, old cables installed in field units
will be replaced with fiber-optic cables, and a WAN will be added.
Furthermore, it is to be introduced a new technology, such as the
VoIP, and establish an integrated internet network.
In alignment with the establishment of the Mega Center, the
ROK military is concentrating its efforts on building an
infrastructure that encompasses host and personal computers. The
Mega Center has already established one pilot center for each
Service and presently aims to integrate scattered information and
communication offices, not to mention the host computers of
individual Services into 61 information and communication centers.
In addition, it is promoting the shift of the application system. Until
2012, the MND will build two to four Mega Centers through which
integrated operations are available to all of the Services. Personal
computers are being disseminated under the goal of achieving
“one personal computer for each military personnel in charge.”As
of October 2006, the dissemination rate of personal computers
within the ROK military stands at 95%, and the military intends to
raise the rate to 100% by 2008.
Under the information protection system, a practical manual for
cyber security crisis confrontation is already published to cope with
a cyber crisis step-by-step. CERTs, operated by units at the level of a
corps or higher, have set up the basic system tackling cyber threats
by developing an integrated security control system, computer virus
prevention system, and military certification system. In addition, they
will be organized to have more duties according to the establishment
of the battlefield management information system and the defense
integrated information management office. The MND plans on
upgrading the information protection system for future NCW.


BTL (Build-Transfer-Lease):
The BTL is a lease-type private
funding project method. First,
a private enterprise constructs
a social infrastructure using its
own fund. While transferring
the ownership of the
constructed infrastructure to
the state or a local
government, it leases the
facilities to the state or a local
government to recover the
investment cost.

B. Promotion of Defense Digitization
in Alignment with National Digitization Policy.

Since the MND developed the strategy to adopt a defense
digitization policy appropriate for the national information
technology infrastructure and technology policy, it has currently
strengthened policy cooperation with the Ministry of Information
and Communication. The MND is focusing on applying innovative
information technologies to national defense in order to improve
the efficiency of defense digitization and boost national IT
competitiveness.
To achieve these goals, the MND signed an agreement with the
ministry of information and communication in 2005 and carried out
cooperation projects. For example, as a part of the introduction of
“u-IT839”new technology, the military ammunition management
system (based on the RFID and the F-15K finance management
system) was introduced as a model project. In 2006, the MND
promoted the u-ammunition management expansion project (based
on the RFID) as well as knowledge DB establishment projects,
such as the defense academic information system and defense
document management system. It also built Linuxexclusive education places in all of the Services as a
software model project.
In addition, the MND formed the digitization
cooperation committee with the ministry of information
and communication (May 2006). This committee
determined 24 cooperation tasks in six fields, which
have been promoted by the MND since the second half

- CIO workshop in 2006

of 2006.

C. Digitization Education


The MND annually holds the “CIO workshop”designed for team
leaders or higher level officials in the defense digitization field in
order to boost the digitization mind of military high-ranking officials.
To improve working-level capabilities in defense digitization,
the MND opened courses for digitization project managers and
supervision in 2001 as well as AF and CBD courses in 2006.

Section 4. Pursuit of Defense Digitization


In addition, the MND is trying to utilize digitization technology
to the utmost possible extent for civilian-administrative-military
technological exchanges in the defense digitization technology
areas and to apply high technology to defense digitization. At the
same time, technological symposiums on defense digitization have
been held to promote efficient defense digitization every December
since 2000.
A cyber information room is going to be set up after the BTO. It
aims at preventing soldiers from being cut off from the information
society during the service period. This will help solve the so-called
digital gap problem and increase employment opportunities for
discharged soldiers by helping them get educational credits or
professional certificates during the service period.
The MND plans to establish cyber knowledge information
rooms using a mixture of cables and the Internet according to the
environment of individual units in phases by 2008.

method. After a private
enterprise first constructs a
social infrastructure using its
own fund, the BTO transfers
the ownership to the state or a
local government, but has the
right of operating the facilities
for a certain period of time in
order to recover the
investment cost.

The paradigm of an advanced culture in the barracks we must pursue
is to promote the environment in which it is possible to hold dreams and
goals, respect human liberties, lead a fulfilling life and perform dutiful
military service in order to build a harmonious and united military force of
strength. Promotion of an advanced barracks culture will focus in the
direction of the military acting as the guardian of peace and prosperity as
well as assembling a strong military force while keeping the public's trust
and love.

1. Vision of an Advanced Culture in the Barracks

New-age soldiers have matured through the
development of IT and a society that places a high
value on personal norms and creativity. Thus, a
portion of soldiers may tend to feel culturally
alienated and frustrated at the communal and
authoritarian military life. Many may even go as far
as viewing military service as wasted time.
Moreover, authoritarian command, conflict
between the old and new generations, an
undeveloped military environment, etc. still exist in present society
and military service, giving rise to confused emotions towards the
military. The conscience and societal separation between civilian and
military impedes the preservation of firm military preparedness and
the unification of society. Therefore, the improvement of a barracks
culture is of utmost importance to developing national defense,
possibly even the nation itself.
Consequently, the MND has created the “Barracks Culture
Improvement Committee,”which is a joint project by the relevant
government authorities and the civilian specialists, providing an
opportunity to identity the problems with life in the barracks and


-----

Section 5. Settlement of a New Barrack Culture

epochally restructure the paradigm of a barracks culture.
The “Barracks Culture Improvement Committee”has stipulated
the definition of “an advanced barracks culture”to be “a whole of
a logical and democratic life in the barracks with which the
foundation to win against the enemies is built up based upon
respecting human liberties and holding public trust.”Thus, the
direction of “the improvement of a barracks culture”in order to be
in line with the goals of defense reform and that of national
development can be pointed into three goals: “A military that has
dreams and goals,”“a refreshing military that respects human
liberties,”and “a family-like military that allows individuals to
focus on their missions.”
The paradigm of an advanced barracks culture we must pursue
should be as seen in Figure 5-26. As the figure shows, the paradigm is
to hold dreams and goals, respect human liberties, and create an
environment in which a fufilling life and dutiful military service are
possible. A harmonious and united military force can be fostered
through these.

<Figure 5-26> Paradigm of a Advanced Barracks Culture

Environment

Dream and Goal + Respect Human Liberties + Development

Fostering a Harmonious and United Military Force of Strength


To realize this paradigm, the promoted goals of an advanced
barracks culture are to convert officers’awareness, create an
environment for self-development, accept a plethora of cultures,
respect human rights, improve the environment, etc. Through the
achievement of these goals, the advanced barracks culture’s vision
is creating a “military that people want to attend, and send.”
The MND has articulated these in the “Defense Reform 2020”as
long-term, core tasks for the “formation of the 21st century strong
military.”To facilitate the process, the MND formed and started the
“Barracks Culture Improvement Committee”(June 2006) as an advisory


-----

5

organization, including soldiers’parents as committee members.

2. Significant Improvement of Culture in the Barracks

A. “A Military with Dreams and Goals
that People Want to Attend”

(1) Establishment of Military Personnel Value

To build the value of military
personnel, a change in the officer's
consciousness is judged as a primary
necessity. Hence, education by class
is bolstered. In addition, military
personnel can undertake firsthand
study to foster a democratic civilian
frame of mind and the establishment
of a “Value Research Center” is
encouraged to systematically educate
the military personnel psyche as well

- Captains to experience difficulties of newly-enlisted soldiers as value.

To induce a change in officer’s consciousness, any higher
ranking officer above a field grade officer attends a reinforced
education session to cultivate a change of perspective during their
duty training. Any unit officers below battalion-level are educated
to enhance consulting capabilities in order to familiarize them to a
“culture of respect and care.”
By developing a communal lifestyle program and providing a
learning experience connected to life in the barracks, military
personnel can acquire a democratic awareness. Military status will
be developed along with local community through participating in
local cultural event programs associated with the local
governments. Furthermore, education by professional civilian
lecturers residing near the battalion-level unit will enhance moral
education and contribute to a more integrated civilian-military
relationship.


-----

Section 5. Settlement of a New Barrack Culture

A special research center about barracks life for the
establishment of a sound value system in service members will be
introduced to study the special military characteristics, the division
between the moral values of officers and enlisted men, the
psychology of new age soldiers, the assessment of the value of
behavior within the unit, etc. The behavioral scientific research
results will continually be provided to commanders in order to
create a sound military value system and cultivate a futureorientated leadership to ultimately raise the “true soldier.”

(2) Building of Conditions for Self-Development

To allow the service members internet access, the MND has
installed cyber knowledge information rooms by company/platoon
units. As a result, the information gap during military service period
is solved. Language studies as well as various licenses can be
obtained. Moreover, by the association with the government’s
“Special Law of Juvenile Unemployment Solution,”military human
resources can be developed and
working conditions improved to
establish an infrastructure that
promotes a higher quality of life.
By the end of 2008, 50,000
internet PCs will be installed and
utilized over three stages. At the same
time, cyber counseling internet PCs
will be supplied to captains/battalion
commanders and chief master
sergeants to provide opportunities for
enlisted men to receive counseling for - Use of a cyber knowledge information room
their concerns.
In the meantime, to allow for credit acquisition and completion
of certificate courses, a military e-learning portal site has been
opened. As seen with Figure 5-27, the site is associated with the
Ministry of Education and Human Resources Development to
organize and run the “Military e-Learning Studying Contents


-----

Chapter Establishment of an Advanced Defense Management System
5

Operation Committee.”In addition, the establishment of cyber
knowledge information rooms allows for a variety of content by
universities and public institutions to be offered, such as language
studies, employment, specialization/major, and college entrance.
These subjects allow conditions for self-improvement and
educational programs for the adaptation of service personnel to
civilian society before discharge from service possible.
Furthermore, the “Military Qualification System Improvement
Committee”was founded (October 19, 2005) to promote the
expansion of the exemption for the written exams on national
technical qualifications as well as

<[Figure 5-27> Establishment of the e-Learning System

national recognition for military
experience. To achieve these means,
legal registration is pursued.
Furthermore, to present to service

collectively supplied until the end of June 2006, and after 2007, 100
books will be supplied every year to satisfy the servicemen’s cultural
needs and contribute to cultivating their
emotions.


-----

Section 5. Settlement of a New Barrack Culture

B. Human Rights in the ‘Army to Belong To’

(1) Legal and Institutional Provisions
to Ensure Service members' rights

Through the enactment of the “Basic Law on Military Service,”
as a civilian wearing uniform, service members’basic rights
(communication privacy, freedom of religion, right to ask for
assistance in times of need, etc.) are ensured, and the duty of a
combat soldier (loyalty to one’s country, obedience to higher
command, etc.) and the restrictions on personal rights (prohibition
of group actions, limited political activities, prohibition of selfserving actions and holding an additional post, etc.) are to be
specified and provided for in the law.
To set up and execute military policy on human rights and
plans to increase military servicemen’s personal rights, the MND
Legal Affairs Management Bureau has created (since January 2,
2006) a “human rights team,”and established a human rights
officer position in each Service in order to supervise the protection
of rights of subordinate units’service members and set up and the
expansion of human rights plans.
In association with service members’assurance of human
rights, the sympathy between the military and civilian are formed
through civilian participation. The “Military Subcommittee”under
the “Ombudsman of Korea”is to provide for the objectivity and
professionalism of military difficulty settlement. By esrablishing
these committees, all issues (medical, abuse, severe actions, etc.)
are to be taken care of in the MND, subordinate units, as well as
affiliated agencies.

(2) Guarantee of Self-Disciplined Life

By utilizing the internet to build a virtual web meeting system to
increase interaction with family and friends as well as developing
online games to introduce barracks life and provide opportunities
for pre-enrolled men a chance to indirectly experience a barracks


-----

Chapter Establishment of an Advanced Defense Management System
5

life, policies to publicly show barracks life are strongly
promoted. Furthermore, with active communication with
civilians and improvements of the going/sleeping out
system to close the gap with the outside, detailed
orientations on rules and policies ease adaptations into
the unit.
The barracks life of servicemen is improved to aid to

- Picture of the club activity switch to a self-disciplined daily activity timetable as seen

in Figure 5-28. Servicemen can voluntarily participate in creating a
barracks culture, and after duty work, personal time is expanded
until midnight to make self-development possible.
By distinctively dividing military life and personal time through
applying the concept of “Going Home from Work,”a liberating
atmosphere can be induced while keeping military discipline and
rules alive, and creating conditions for a self-disciplined lifestyle.
However, those who fail to reach personal training standards are
restricted in the amount of personal freedom they are given, thus

putting responsibility on the individual for self-discipline.
(3) Development of an Advanced Leadership

To cultivate an advanced leadership, improving the system to
appoint officers with potential and strengthening leadership


-----

Section 5. Settlement of a New Barrack Culture

education for each rank by the educational institutes are necessary
in order to allow officers to be in an environment where they are
able to fully able to display their leadership. The selection method
for appointing and utilizing superior candidates who show traits of
leadership is distinguishing the core competencies by position of
service and rank, and scientifically, as well as objectively, setting a
standard for appointment. This system is to be developed and
experimentally applied in 2007, to later be expanded.
From 2007, each Service will embody the qualities and abilities
required for junior officers. Then, junior officers’s virtues and
leadership will be part of the candidate training courses, and
leadership conforming with characteristics of units and ranks will
be provided in regular courses during the period of refresher
training. In addition, leadership mastery programs to provide the
military officers with a systematic leadership education will be
developed and applied.
According to the military’s characteristics, the will and unit
management philosophy of the commander are important. Using a
specialized institute to introduce a system of examination,
assessment and advice for commanders, and providing
opportunities for the commanders under the regimental
commander-level to prove their own worth while in office, will
create a leadership of human respect.
Additionally, to ensure the full authority and command range of
the squad leaders, the actualization of command activity expenses
based upon the number of members in the squad will be
implemented to improve an environment of command.

C. “A Family-like Military”That Can Concentrate
on Duty

(1) Improvement of Personnel Management System
to Sift out Unsuitable Conscripts

The strengthening of conscription examinations by the office of
military manpower administration to psychological assessments by
using tests in civilian hospital and clinical psychologists, as well as


5


-----

Chapter Establishment of an Advanced Defense Management System
5

conscription using civilian doctors for conscription
examinations, will increase public trust. Moreover, the
implementation of the physical examination rule to
professionally categorize patients with rare and incurable
diseases as exempt from military service will continually
enhance the capabilities of sifting out draftees unsuitable
for service.

- Scene of the physical examination From 2007, advanced equipment for detailed physical

examinations (such as CT, CPA, etc.) will be introduced and past
medical history of conscript men will be used together with 3-D
physical examinations and to discover mentally handicapped
patients beforehand law. With the implementation of the “physical
examination rules for servicemen,”the system of conscription
examination will especially seek to identity patients with rare and
incurable disease. This will objectively and closely minimize the
command burden because of personnel unfit for service.
Meanwhile, because the identification of personnel unfit for
service within the first five days of enlistment by the current legal
formalities is unrealistic, extending the period until the education
of new servicemen will be put into operation. Also, unfit personnel
spotted by the commanders during the training period are to be
placed under observation for five weeks, as well as the medical
inspection committee, and peer evaluation collected to evaluate the
necessity to relocate or transfer the servicemen to other a public
service to reduce the pressure in the attached unit. Furthermore,
because the process of dealing with unfit personnel once placed
into an attached unit is lengthy, ways to speed up the process,
such as passing authority to deal with unfit personnel to the flag
officer-level units, are under development.

(2) Establishment of Accident Control System

At the moment, despite the analysis of accident cases and
attempts to prevent accidents by each Service, the incomplete
computerization of related information and the lack of scientific
analysis ultimately lead to inadequate systematic prevention plans.
With the construction of an accident management system, which


-----

Section 5. Settlement of a New Barrack Culture


holds and shares accident related material, units by rank can access
accident related material with ease and use its benefits at any
moment.
“Simple human nature inspection for the military”was
developed, and now is open for opportune use by the field troops.
A scientific management system will be installed through the
improvement and application of a human nature inspection system
jointly usable by each Service to differentiate each serviceman’s
aptitude, and hospital management utilizing a professional
technique (the ROK Army’s Vision Camp) to induce service
adaptation.
To provide professional counseling on unfit personnel within
the barracks, one civilian expert counselor or psychologist will be
appointed to take the position of the professional counselling
officer of servicemen’s basic rights at the regiment-level unit to
actively advise the commanders methods to prevent accidents and
provide counseling services to the unit.
From August 2006, the MND and each military headquarters
have been operating the “Accident Integrated Counterplan
Headquarters”in face of critical accidents, and based upon the
type of accident, a special investigation team is flexibly assembled
and operated to scientifically analyze and accurately provide an
official report with due haste. By maintaining professionalism,
consistency and transparency and providing effective management
for the accident’s aftermath, the public's faith in the military is
bolstered.

(3) Improvement of Facilities in the Barracks

Improvements to the barracks facilities are focused on the
transition of living halls to squad-level quarters with individual
beds and provide a fairly large space for personal use in thought of
the new-age servicemen’s growth environment. Rather than
maintaining the basic “accommodation”concept of the military
living space, converting into a “dwelling”concept is the center of
modifications. Facility improvement projects take into account
military structure reorganization plans and national finance to


Vision Camp:
The vision camp is a military's
own course to correct
psychological problems.
Psychological treatments are
provided to a small group of
service incongruent personnel
identified in order to enhance
their cognitive capabilities to
solve their problems. The
purpose of such treatments
make the self-treatment
possible, inducing the service
adaptation. Right now, the
vision camp caters to a group
of 20 personnel, by every two
months at the division level
units. Generally, military
religious officers, military
doctors, and counselors in the

lecturers. Those lecturers stay
at the specific area in the
division for five days in order to
administer counselling and

maintenance budgets while primarily working to improve
units in remote and distant areas and inferior facilities.
The goal and length of the improvement project are
largely divided into two stages, the first stage is to
reduce the length of the existing plan by one year in
order to improve over 50% of the facilities in the barracks
by 2009.
During the first stage, units such as GP and those out in remote
and distant areas are first improved due to the unchanged
placement of the buildings even after the reorganization of military
structure. In the second stage, currently modernized units and units
excluded from the first stage are improved, and the construction
method is specified to allow recyclable buildings, which in turn
allows flexible countermeasures in case of situation changes.
The “barracks facilities packaging”reflects the overall
improvement requirements, starting from the GP buildings, in
which central heating and cooling systems to basic facilities are
further ameliorated. Bearing in mind the budget cost of units in
remote and distant areas and integrated living halls of battalion-
level units only the buildings and fixtures are prepared, the
enhancements gradually put into effect starting from 2007.

3. Future Task

To earn the faith of the people and firmly establish the unity
between the civilian and military, the MND is selecting and
promoting the barracks culture improvement task as a key project for
military innovation. In order for the effective promotion of this task,
the MND will continually listen to criticisms of the people, service
members, and experts. Through various advertising media, barracks
culture improvements, results, and associated news will be actively
be presented to the public, and with the Barracks Culture
Improvement Committee, the Internet, and the press, the MND will
hear the ideas and assessments from the people to reflect those in the
future.

The ROK military is making efforts to make things convenient for
people in the area where its support is needed, but without causing
damage to military operations and at the same time maintaining its
flawless posture in executing its basic mission in normal times.

The ROK military implements its mission sincerely as “military of the
people.”For example, it actively supports the people by utilizing
manpower, equipment and techniques of the military, offering high quality
service to the people, pushing for an information disclosure system to
enhance the transparency of the administration, satisfying the people’s
right to know, positively promoting a national disaster management policy,
and reorganizing military facilities efficientry.

1. Management of Military Facilities

Effectively reorganizing military facilities, the ROK military is
conducting an all-out effort not only to enhance the comport of its
people, but also to secure military operations corresponding to
national security and operational environment changes.

A. Readjustment of the Military’s Using Private Land

The ROK military is constantly pushing for compensation and
readjustment to the military’s use of private land by securing the
people’s property rights. The MND is returning its unused private
land purchasing properties that it needs to use continuously
according to the “Act on Acquisition of Compensation for Land for
Public Benefits Projects.”The revenue for the compensation are
allocated by means of a “special accounts budget for the military’s
use of private land”since 1995. Figure 6-1 shows the readjustment
of private land used by the military.

Moreover, the ROK military is taking legal measures to acquire
private land for military purposes by obtaining agreement from the
landowner or purchasing the land beforehand.

B. Pushing for the Move of Military Facilities

The relocation of military facilities has been progressing
continuously since 1966 to enhance the people’s convenience,
efficiently use the national land, achieve balanced development of
urban areas, and develop modernized military facilities in line with
the acquirements for military operations.
The MND has relocated 74 military facilities investing 1,579.0 billion
won from 1998 to 2006, as shown in Table 6-2. In spite of the lack of
funds, caused by the failure to dispose of lands due to the slow real
estate market, the demand for the movement of military facilities has
increased in the wake of the enforcement of the local autonomy
system. In 2007, it is scheduled to continue with the additional
movement of 30 military facilities by investing 269.0 billion won.

C. Managemental Improvement
of Military Facilites Protection Zone

The MND is pushing ahead with legislation
enlisted “Protection of Military installations and
Bases Act”by integrating existing protection acts
such as “Protection of Military Installation Act,”
“Naval Bases Act”and “Military Air Bases Act.”
The bill has redefined military-related
protection areas as “military base and facility

- The MND's briefing for the improvement of the protection areas”and it has tried to resolve
management of military facility protection zone (‘06. 9)

administrative problems and secure civilian
property rights by simplifying related rules and
procedures etc. Table 6-3 shows the specific contents of the military
protection zone readjustment.
The new legislation introduces a system of land purchase,
which enables the purchase of land from an owner, within the
scope of the available budget, if the landowner inside the military
protection zone chooses to sell the land.
This legislation allows for new buildings or the enlargement of
structures inside military control and protection areas if they do not

<Table 6-3> Readjustment of Military Protection Zone

|Classification|Current|Revision (Expect to be executed in the late 2007)|
|---|---|---|
|The front-line control and protection zone|within 15 km south of the military demarcation line|within 10 km south of the military demarcation line|
|The rear-line control and protection zone|within 500 m from the external boundary of the unit|within 300 m from the external boundary of the unit|
|The rear-line restraint and protection zone|within 1 km from the external boundary of the unit|within 500 m from the external boundary of the unit|



cause any impediment to military operations.
The new law stipulates that local residents can put forward
different views on the various administrative measures in
connection with the military protection zone. It also supplements
the process for claiming losses in case that the MND limits the use
of various facilities in order to conduct military operations inside
the military protection zone. On the other hand, the Minister of
National Defense and the relevant commander in the region are


-----

Section 1. Enhancement of the People's Convenience

supposed to set up a management plan for the protection zone
within 5 years to ensure systematic and consistent management of
the military protection zone. The MND has classified the reserved
military operations base for helicopters as a spare base for air
operations and has given directions to designate one of these bases
as a flying safety zone.
It has also changed the administrative process for constructing
buildings inside a military protection zone. The MND has required
citizens to consult with the military agency beforehand instead of
having to make a mandatory report to the administrative agency.

D. Addressing Inconvenience for Local Residents

As a part of resolving the difficulties for local
residents, the MND has adjusted the scope and time of
the restrictive fisheries zone on the basis of regional
characteristics.
It has continuously maintained the use of barbed wire
on beaches classified as an urgent military operations
zone, but it allows for the elimination of some of the
barbed wire barriers on the bans of consultation with the
local government. entanglements in the East Sea
As part of the regulations governing the setting up of barriers,
the MND utilizes a mobile barriers in wide open areas such as the
golf courses.
Moreover, the MND is taking positive measures to consider
civilian appeals. For example, it has been appointed a fire marshal
who is a field commander to execute rescue missions as a standing
member of the integrated regional defense committee.

2. Enforcement of the Support System
for Disaster Management

A. Promoting Support for Disaster Management

It is expected that universal changes of weather such as a
typhoon, flood, or heavy snow fall might cause a large scale
natural disaster.
The MND is planning to promote disaster management policies
to protect people’s life and property.
The MND has reached agreement on disaster cooperation with the
National Disaster Prevention and Countermeasures Headquarters
(2005.8.22) and it has set up a cooperative system between the
government and the military by designating military units which are
able to support the local governrnent.
Additionally, it has published a working manual for
the MND in connection with the government’s
standard manual for crisis management (2005.11.29).
It has been posted on the MND website and revised all
the regulations in dealing with disaster prevention
measures (2005. 11. 21).
The MND has arranged specialists to lecture
commanders of various levels, soldiers and

- Specialist’s lecture on disaster management

government officials in the MND and
Gyeryongdae area who are in charge of the
disaster relief effort so that they can provide
active and systematic support for disaster
management and people’s relief in case that
a disaster occurs.
The MND has set up disaster management
curricula for military schools of various levels
including the Korea National Defense
University. In addition, it provides training in
the special educational institute such as the

- Sea surface training in search and rescue helicopter

Civil Defense Training Center and it also
carries out various disaster management educational exercises.
In addition, the MND has constantly striven to promote disaster


-----

Section 1. Enhancement of the People's Convenience

management support work in various areas such as reinforcing
disaster-related organizations and personnel of each service’s
headquarters, establishing a “disaster and security management
item in the budget,”opening a seminar on the promotion of
disaster management for civilians, government and the military,
enhancing the national defense disaster management information
system, protecting the national infrastructure system and
management of national resources.

B. Promoting Support for Disaster Recovery Activity

The ROK military continually maintains a
posture of preparedness by managing search
and rescue units and maintaining 210
briefing rooms for counter disaster
operations nationwide.
The MND has conducted support
activities for urgent rescue and damage
recovery whenever a large scale disaster has
occurred such as the typhoon “Megi”in
2004, tsunamis and earthquakes in Southern
Asia, the mountain fire in the eastern part of
Korea in 2005, the typhoon “Ewiniar”and
the earthquake in Indonesia in 2006. - Restoration of a greenhouse after the snowstorm

C. Development of Disaster Management Support

The support of disaster management has involves prevention,
emergency support and recovery, as well as in specialized disaster
management education and integrated counter disaster training of
civilians, governmental authorities and the military. First of all, the
MND is planning to vitalize the education of disaster management
in the military units by introducing such education at various
levels of the military academy’s regular curriculum. It also
plans to provide education targeting the work level members
of anti-disaster or emergency rescue teams, and to expand
annual field lecturing tours by inviting disaster specialists to
lecture.
Regular educational training in units above the battalionlevel units to prepare for disaster will take place. Participation

- Military provides a supporting
role in extinguishing in an integrated national disaster exercise which will include
a mountain fire in Yeongdong district the civil, government, and military entities is being

encouraged.
Moreover, protection of the national infrastructure system to
maintain the state’s function even though the public service is
discontinued is given high priority, and it is intended to
actively participate in large scale overseas emergency relief
measures.
The disaster management
capability of the whole military
will be enhanced. Units above the
regiment-level are designing 19
working level manuals of various
types and utilizing them. Local
governments and designated
cooperative military units have set
up an emergency contact system
as well as agreeing detailed
procedures.
Furthermore, it is intended to
designate additional disaster

- Providing relief goods and equipments for South Asian earthquake and tsunami


-----

Section 1. Enhancement of the People's Convenience

relief units which will be in charge of islands or special disaster
operations, and to increase manpower and organize each military
unit’s disaster management.

3. Reform of the Civil Petition Process

A. Reform of Information Disclosure


The information disclosure system is designed to enhance the
transparency of administrative affairs and on the basis of the people’s
right to know. It intends to do this by offering the public agency’s
information possessed by the national organization and local
governments bodies beforehand and by responding to the people’s
requests.
The MND is implementing “The Guidelines on Disclosure about
National Defense Administration Information”to meet the government’s
information disclosure system. Additionally, the MND is offering
important information such as major operational plans, and internal
inspection results, and this can be accessed by viewing the MND’s
home page (www.mnd.go.kr). Futhermore it seeks to maximize
information disclosure by establishing “minute guidelines about
non-disclosure information.”
If an applicant (the people, a corporate body, a group, a
foreigner residing in South Korea) intends to acquire some specific
information about the MND, one can request it through internet
integrated information disclosure system (www.open.go.kr), as
well as a mail service or a fax.
Information disclosure depends upon the guidelines on
information disclosure and the MND is supposed to notify the
claimant within 10 days after deciding whether it is going to
disclose the information or not.
The information that is disclosed may be delivered to the
claimant through mail, fax or e-mail.


Guidelines of Information
Disclosure:
All the information that is
claimed has to be disclosed in
principle but secret, or
classified information relating
to national security, national
defense, reunification,
diplomatic relations, etc. and
the information which can be
critical to the protection of
lives, body, and property of
the people can not be opened
to the public.


-----

Chapter National Defense with the people
6

The number of applications for information disclosure have
dramatically increased since 1998 due to a growing awareness of
the people’s rights in the wake of the passing of the “Official
Information Disclosure Act.”Figure 6-5 shows that the number of
requests for information disclosure from the year 2002 to 2005 has
increased over 5 times from 110 to 626, and the number of
disclosures has increased about 8.3 times from 58 to 483.
A “Public Files Corner”is operated by the MND on its
homepage (www.mnd.go.kr) for easy public access to
information. The “Public Files Corner”offers 17,127 information

indexes, 7,420 important papers, 523 projects which are supposed
to be announced in advance (2006. 10. 31). From July 2006, the
MND has improved the function of its homepage and offers the
original text of disclosed papers beside the indexes for the
information.
For the future, the MND has put into action plans for a
transparent national defense administration and it is also planning
to guarantee the people’s right to know by expanding the object of


-----

Section 1. Enhancement of the People's Convenience

information disclosure if circumstances allow except for classified
information related to national security or national defense.

B. Reform of the Civil Petition System

With the advent of the 21 century’s knowledge and information
age, the MND is constantly pushing ahead with the improvement
of the civil petition system to offer a high quality service
corresponding with a growing awareness of people’s rights and the
level of people’s consciousness.
To improve public satisfaction with the civil petition service, the
MND does its best to determine the problems which cause
inconvenience or discontent in all areas of national defense.
The MND published the “2005 MND Civil Petition White Paper”to
offer a high quality service and to improve the civil petition system
in 2005. It has established a petition portal system and put in place
a civil petition administration infrastructure by standardization of
the on-line civil petition process of the whole military unit and
public institutions.
As a consequence, the MND scored 9th place out of 43 in a
survey of satisfaction, which was commissioned by the Korea
Institute of Public Administration over civil petitions in public
institutions as shown by Figure 6-6.
In 2006, the MND pushed ahead with the improvement of the
civil petition system to enhance “the people’s satisfaction level by
offering a high quality civil petition service.”It has a policy vision
of achieving an “advanced national defense civil petition
administration act in common with the people.”
The MND is promoting the development of its civil petition
service by selecting 21 tasks divided into 7 fields as shown by
Figure 6-7 .
The MND actively participated in the “national on-line portal
system”which is promoted by the Ministry of Government

petitions.”The MND is constantly striving to enhance the people’s
satisfaction levels by improving the communication environment so
that people can utilize the resources of the general civil affairs
office with convenience and comfort.

4. Support for the People

In ordinary times, the ROK military is regularly engaged in
activities to support people by utilizing equipment, techniques, and
available military manpower where its
assistance is needed.
The ROK military regularly supports rice
planting and harvesting activities for the
needy areas of the farming sector where
timely sowing and harvesting is difficult
due to the lack of workers in the busy
farming season. Table 6-8 shows the
present state of the military’s support for
farming for the last 5 years.

- A support activity for rice planting

The MND is offering technical support for
the repair of farming equipment such as cultivators or rice planting
machines, making rounds of the region where there is no service
center for maintenance. This is achieved by organizing a “roving

repair team”for repairing farming equipment. Additionally, to
keep abreast with structural change in the farm sector, it is focusing
on basic facility expansion such as maintenance, and river
improvement, rather than simple manpower support.
As part of the campaign to foster farm villages, the MND is
actively supporting farming workers by “forming relationships
between a particular military unit and a farming village.”This
contributes to the enhancement of national health by providing
free medical treatment and helping to prevent epidemics.


-----

Section 2. Improvement of the Administration of Conscription

The MND is constantly pursuing service improvement with new
regislation including the “Military Service Act”to realize a fair, transparent
and balanced conscription administration process.

It is striving to produce reliable conscription administration by
implementing the efficient management of military resources and a fair
and transparent conscription administration system so that it can create a
climate for volunteering and create a good impression on its clients
through service reform.

1. Enhancement of Fairness in Imposing Military Duty

The MND is pushing ahead with a system which can enhance
the fairness, transparency and balance in conscription measures to
promote an atmosphere for performing military service voluntarily.
First of all, it has reformed the physical examination regulations
for conscription to enhance their fairness and accuracy. It has
stipulated objectively and concisely the categories of medical
conditions and the definition of physically or mentally
handicapped people and it has also newly introduced an exclusive
clause of exemption related to body (height or weight). For
example a person who is below the height of 145 cm is supposed
to be exempt from military service. In addition, it introduced a
system for psychological evaluation to be carried out in a civilian
hospital chosen by the conscript and it is also working on securing
a clinical psychologist so as to strengthen psychological
examinations.
In particular, the MND is operating a “warning system”to
prevent specific individuals from evading military duty. It has
identified 96,000 people who were targeted for close examination
during 2006 by operating a warning system for those who were
possible duty evaders, and inputting detailed information of


-----

Chapter National Defense with the people
6

physical examinations into a database.
The MND has introduced an internet
reporting system to prevent the illegal evasion of
military duty and it has designated an specific
persons to check illegal internet sites related to
military service.
It is also operating the “civil participatory
committee for the development of conscription

- Civil participatory committee talks for the development administration”and resolves complaints and
of the conscription administration process objections of the physical examinee by the

introduction of an ombudsman system in the
physical examination process for conscription.
Meanwhile, the MND is scheduled to improve the military
service system so as to secure fairness in military service and
developing a strong and well trained military, utilizing its young
human resources effectively while considering the ROK’s reduction
of its working population.

2. Revision of Related Laws

The MND is constantly revising related laws to promote a
desirable military service culture. While it is abolishing the military
register attachment system, where a person’s service record is
reported, the MND is pushing ahead with a revision of the law
regarding the disclosure and reporting of a civil servant’s military
record. This revision may eliminate the system of reporting
changes in changing a person’s military record, or shorten the
period of disclosure over the changed content.
The revised “Enforcement Decree of The Military Service Act”
involves the following: dispatching a notification paper for
conscription utilizing an electronic system; practicing early physical
reexaminations for Grade 7 rated diseases in case of recovery;
revision of the service related process to secure interest and rights
of public service member; the specialist or skilled vocational
technician’s enhancement of rights and interest, and efficient
revision of service management; and improving related text to
enable the introduction of public veterinarian system. The revised


-----

Section 2. Improvement of the Administration of Conscription

enforcement decree stipulates that the public service member can
choose the service institute. Due to the new law, the relevant
public service member who demands reconsideration by the
serving institute for reason of illness, or mental or physical
handicap, can deal with the problem with the attachment of a
diagnosis for military personnel.

3. Research & Development of the Alternative Service System


The alternative service system refers to a public service in place
of active military duty to utilize surplus human resources after
filling the quota for servicemen on active duty. Currently, the kinds
of alternative services in operation include the conversion service
system, service as a specialist research member, skilled industrial
technician, public sanitation doctor and public law officer, system
of public service member, international cooperation doctor, etc.
Recently the need for a general and fundamental review regarding
alternative service is gaining momentum as a result of various requests
for expanding cases for exemption from military service. Such groups
include athletes, artists, and conscientious objectors.
For this reason the MND has been operating a “research
committee for an alternative service system”since April 5, 2006
(tentative operation until the last of June 2007).
The research committee for an alternative service system is
placing its focus on setting principles and standards for alternative
service including cases involving foreign countries, and objections
to military service on the grounds of religious belief or other
reasons of conscience. It will consider whether the alternative
service system is necessary or not. In addition to that, the MND is
scheduled to suggest policy options by analyzing the results of a
public opinion poll. Table 6-9 shows research priority by the area.

4. Expansion of Benefit to the Military Duty Performer

The MND is developing various systems to expand benefits to
the process of people’s fulfilling military duty. First of all, it is
expanding a “self-choice system of military service.”Conscripts


Conversion service system:
Converting soldier status by
letting the soldier on service to
serve for combatant police
unit, or security instructor of
the correctional institution, etc.

and if there is a vacant post.
Additionally, the conscription date and the way of conscript
decides which serving institute he will apply for has been changed
from a monthly to a quarterly choice. Furthermore, the MND has
expanded the opportunity of choosing the conscription date and
serving institute to include those who have delayed the appointed
conscription date. It even allows to choose a serving institute
located in a nearby city, county, and ward where public service is
possible near their residence.


-----

Section 2. Improvement of the Administration of Conscription


The MND has expanded enlisted numbers to allow
members to return to school in possible periods after
serving the military service. They have joined the
military with possible periods of return to school being
January, February, July, August. The numbers joining
the military stands at 52,000 in 2005 and 59,000 in
2006.
But there is a limit to the amount of expansion to
avoid problems with the management of human
resources in the military.
In addition, the MND has abolished the license
system for foreign tourism and subsequent notification
after return from an overseas trip so that the military
conscript can go on an overseas trip freely. This has
been achieved by introducing an application system
where Korean citizens subject to military duty can
extend the period of an overseas tour through the
internet.

The ROK government is actively pursuing the repatriation of its POWs
from the point of view of “national duty and obligation.”

The government has constantly raised the ROK's POWs issue through
international organizations or Inter-Korean talks, but there still remains
difficulties in investigating the actual state of the ROK's MIA in North Korea.

Thereby, as a realistic policy option, the government actively continues
with the exchange of letters and reunions regarding those POWs as its
separated family members in a broad sense.

1. The Present State of ROK’s POW / MIAs

During the Korean war, there were three occasions when
mutual exchanges of POWs (prisoners of war) occured from April
1953 to January 1954 between United Nation forces and
Communist forces. At the time, the UN HQ counted the number of
the ROK’s MIA as 82,000 individuals, but the number of MIAs
finally released by the communist party to the UN is only 8,343
persons.
Accordingly, it is estimated that most of the ROK military’s
POWs who remain in North Korea do so against their
wishes. The U.N’s HQ constantly demanded North
Korea repatriate the ROK’s POW through the Military
Armistice Commission until early 1960. (But the issue is
yet to be resolved, given North Korea’s adherence to
the position that there are no ROK’s POWs being
detained in North Korea). Amid these claims, by
returning the ROK’s POW second lieutenant Cho
Chang Ho, the issue of the ROK’s POWs has become a
matter of primary concern. The MND disclosed 19,409
names of MIA during the Korean war on October 1997
through checking military registers and notification


-----

Section 3. Repatriation Effort for POW/MIAs

from MIA’s family members. It is estimated that the list contains a
lot of ROK’s POWs still detained in North Korea.
According to defectors from North Korea and 65 returned ROK’s
POWs, it is estimated that 5545 members of the ROK’s POW still
exist in North Korea as of October 2006.

2. The ROK’s Effort to Resolve

The ROK government has repeatedly brought up the
repatriation of the ROK military’s POW by all possible means in
fulfilling the state’s obligation and duty in the international
community. It also has put all possible efforts into resolving the
POW issue fundamentally by taking the opportunity to raise the
issues during Inter-Korean negotiations.
As a realistic alternative, the ROK government is actively
pushing ahead with the reunion of seperated family members and
letter exchanges. The ROK military’s POW issue is treated as a
reunion of separated family members.
As of today, 11 members of the ROK military’s POW and their
dispersed family members have met again at a reunion event of
separated family members. If the Inter-Korean relationship is improved
after the completion of the reunion facility for separated family
members in the Mt. Keumgang region in the future, it is expected that
more separated POW family members’
reunions might be realized.
As the number of ROK’s POWs
staying in third countries is
increasing, the ROK government
has adopted relevant laws and
systems and is preparing an
organization which will take charge
of POW issues in order to support
their rapid repatriation and stable
settlement. Due to the government’s
efforts, the repatriation of POWs
and their family members in third
world countries is on the increase
and the government is supporting

domestic settlement by supporting living expenses, pay and
pensions which are guaranteed by the law of POW treatment
proclaimed on 29th January 1999.
In addition, the MND conducts informal talks and field trips to
the security site inviting returned POWs and their family members.
The MND will implement a new law addressing some of the
problems in the current law regarding POW treatment. The new
law for the “POW’s Repatriation and Their Treatment”is designed
to offer free medical support by abrogating the current law from
Jan. 1, 2007. In the mean time, the government will continue with
the repatriation of the third world stationed ROK’s POWs and their
family members. It will continue to raise the repatriation issue with
the North Korea through various means at the government level. In
addition, it will map out various policy options for the stable
domestic settlement of POWs and their family members.

Section 4. Operation of an Environmentally-friendly Force

The activity of environmental preservation is very important because it
is directly related to the preservation of national territory where people live
and work.

Accordingly, the ROK Military is actively implementing military
management policies based on environmental protection such as
conducting periodical clean up activities and utilizing natural resources as
much as possible to refrain from damaging the environment of military
posts.

1. Development of the Scheme of Environmental
Protection

The MND is training environmental specialists and expanding
the environmental management organization to undertake
environmental protection work efficiently. To this end, it is
designing measures to acquire specialists and setting up the basis
of an environmental organization which will act through each
Service and affiliated military units.
Table 6-10 shows the requested staffing levels for the
environment preservation departments. The MND is developing an
education and training system, and promoting the management of
assigned positions by status to improve the specialized skills of

<Table 6-10> Staffing of Environment Preservation Department

related personnel.
In addition, the MND will develop the instructions and guiding
principles to harmonize them with 91 relevant laws including
“Framework Act on Environmental Policy.”and defense-related
regulations.
In particular, the ROK military has accelerated its efforts to
improve the environment by developing an environmental
management model which harmonizes with the characteristics of
each military unit. This environmental management model has
been independently managed by each service since 1999.

2. Expanding the Project of Prevention
of Environmental Pollution

The ROK military is enforcing measures to
dispose waste water efficiently by commissioning
outside facilities to dispose of polluted water,
which can amount to more than 200 tons a day.
Disposal is linked to the local government
facilities. Establishing facilities for the prevention
of water contamination was achieved by acquiring
2,367 waste water disposing facilities by the end
of 2005.
Just as shown in Table 6-11, it is scheduled to

- Measurement of vehicles’exhaust gas
(1 time in half a year) acquire a total of 7,420 environmental facilities

including facilities for the prevention of land and air
pollution at an early stage and to constantly repair environmental
facilities to improve wornout equipment and comply with the
reinforced environmental principle.

||100 million won|6,683|3,815|57|510|2,358|


-----

Section 4. Operation of an Environmentally-friendly Force

The ROK military is also implementing the management of
waste and recycling. The waste of the military is dealt with by the
relevant local government and it is incinerated by military trash
burner only if a commissioned disposal is impossible. Meanwhile,
the ROK military is setting up plans and pushing ahead with
comprehensive countermeasure policies through simultaneous
investigation of buried waste.
It is recycling designated waste such as oils, acids, and alkalis
to the maximum and it commissions a specialized agency if
recycling is impossible. As of the later part of 2006, it is operating
25,000 of the separated collection facilities in order to vitalize the
recycling of resources. Table 6-12 shows the military’s waste
disposal as of 2005.

3. Enforcement of the Preservation
of the Natural Environment

The ROK military performs military training or military
operations and it is also protecting the natural environment at the
same time.
The supporting project of regional environmental clean up
activities by military units reflects the opinions of residents’in the
the government and military regional environment committee.
more than 2 million soldiers are performing environmental clean
up activities at military compounds, training camps, rivers, and
parks, collecting more than 16,000 tons of waste every year.


-----

Chapter National Defense with the people
6

The ROK military is proceeding with measures to protect
ecological systems by utilizing the ecological & natural survey
pictures published by the Ministry of Environment.
The ROK military also enforces the protection of the natural
environment in the region, such as in the special preservation areas
designated by the “Natural Environment Conservation Act.”It also
cooperates with relevant agencies with the objective of conducting
academic research and investigating matters related to the region.
Furthermore, it is devising measures for the protection of wild
animals. In 2005, the ROK military has actively participated in wild
animal protection activities through the operation of guard post
(731), the removal of poaching equipment such as nooses or traps
(3,267), and by scattering feed to wild animals (284 tons) in the
winter season.

Section 5. Revitalization of National Defense Publicity

The MND is disclosing the content and processes of major national
defense policies to establish sympathy and direct understanding about
major defense policies. It is constantly publicizing an ‘open national
defense’through an active collection of various level of public opinion.

The purpose of the national defense publicity is to mobilize people's
support by informing them of the true image of the military. At the same
time it is enhancing friendly relationships by publicizing the peace-oriented
ROK military's national defense policy to the neighboring countries and
deterring North Korea's provocation by informing them of the ROK
military's firm countermeasure postures.

In addition to that, the MND is establishing an evaluation system of
national defense publicity in order to support a successful drive and
enhance the qualities of national defense. Meanwhile, it is implementing a
system through which various civilian experts can participate in the
process of national defense policy from drafting to evaluation.

1. Revitalization of National Defense Publicity
and Arrangement of a System

A. Revitalization of National Defense Publicity

The MND conducts regular briefings of it’s major policies. At
the same time, it offers various resources regarding national
concern and current issues regarding national defense by utilizing
military media for publicity such as the national defense focus, the
journal of national defense, military broadcasting, and the national
defense daily news paper.
The military TV broadcasting system, established on December
1, 2005, has provided dramatic development in national defense
publicity by providing a specialized TV channel for national
defense through satellite and local cable broadcasting. The MND
is steadily promoting on-line publicity to meet the demands of an
information-oriented society.

-----

Chapter National Defense with the people
6

The MND is revitalizing the
publicity of national defense policies
by redesigning its home page to
conform to the culture of the modern
netizen. It provided a further service to
the people by up-loading publicized
sources to “MND news,”which is an
internet newspaper.
In addition to that it is promoting
a friendly image of national defense
by operating a mini-home page at
Cyworld.
Furthermore, the MND is sending an E-mail, which contains
policy sources requested by the people or the relevant unit

PCRM: concerned which is related with national defense through PCRM of
Policy Customer Relationship
Management the client management concept. It provides an customized two
way publicity activities by collecting and reflecting public opinion
of policy.
The MND is expanding its shared values of security by planned
publicity events, such as a briefing session concerning the national
defense policy and field trips to
security sites, by targeting leaders
in various fields, like policy
clients, people in press circles,
academic leaders, art performers,
NGOs, veterans, etc.
In addition, the MND is doing its
best to promote an understanding of
the need for “ strong national
defense with the people”by
promoting the national defense

- Conversation between the Minister of National Defense
and Netizen (Sep. 29, 2005) publicity service for the people such

as juvenile training for the fatherland
defense and various experiences in the barracks, producing films for
movies and TV, supporting local cultural events and improving the
process of gaining access to the security tour site.


-----

Section 5. Revitalization of National Defense Publicity

B. Establishment of a System to Evaluate
National Defense Publicity

The national policy in the 21st century can be successfully
realized by the consensus of the people. Hence, the individual
person in charge of policy needs a responsible attitude from policy
drafting to publicity in order to support a successful drive and
enhance the quality of the national defense policy.
So far the publicity for national defense has been promoted in a
way that policy and publicity have been kept separate. This has
caused some confusion or misinformation. Therefore, the MND
reformed the understanding and culture inside the organization
regarding policy and publicity. It now has in place a system to
evaluate publicity so as to produce a new culture of communicating
policy to the public.
The purpose of the evaluation system of national policy
publicity is to reflect the success score of the team leader and
members by applying the achievement management system, and its
aim is to check and reflect whether public policy has been followed
over the whole process in promoting the concerned task from the
level of policy draft and decision making level, to policy executing
level.

2. Civilian Expert Participation
in the National Defense Policy Development

A. The Operation of the National Defense Policy
Advisory Committee

The MND is collecting and reflecting the opinion of relevant
specialists who are knowledgeable and experienced by operating
the National Defense Policy Advisory committee since 1981, which
consists of various experts such as leaders from academic circles
and the press. It is promoting consensus and mutual understanding
between civilians and the military regarding the national defense
policy.
The “National Defense Policy and Advisory Committee”


-----

Chapter National Defense with the people
6

consists of 11 sub-committees dealing with different policy areas. It
is supposed to hold meetings annually. Each subcommittee meets
more than once each quarter to consult on current issues of
national defense. If an urgent issue arises, it can be convened at
any time.
Apart from formal meetings, the National Defense Policy
Advisory Committee operates by various other means such as visits,
letters, telephone conversation, e-mails. Table 6-13 shows each sub

committee’s present state of the constitution
Acting upon government policy to expand the social
participation of women, as of 2006, the MND organized appointed
10 female specialists as advisory commissioners and will expand
the percentage of women gradually taking into account the
peculiarity of the of sub-committee.
By commissioning numerous local figures and persons who
belong to NGOs, it is exerting an effort to reflect various opinions
of a wider section of society.

B. Operation of the MND’s Self-Evaluation Committee

The MND has depended upon internal evaluation for work that
has been completed in the MND so far. However, it has opened
up the whole sphere of national defense to meet the demand of a
new generation by taking a decisive step to ensure the credibility
of the evaluation of its work.
Hence, the MND operates its own evaluation committee, and
the committee is managed by five sub-committees such as a
department of major policy, financial achievement, organization,
personnel management, and information.


-----

Section 5. Revitalization of National Defense Publicity

It considers the self-evaluation plan over the relevant year,
inspection of half term achievement, general evaluation over the
achievement and checking policy if necessary. The self-evaluation
committee consists of thirty civilian experts. The committee
members are comprised of professors, civilian researchers, etc,
irrespective of the gender.

the first half of 2007 in accordance with the agreed Roadmap. In noting the target

year establishment, Secretary Rumsfeld offered assurance that the transition to a

new command structure will be carried out while maintaining and enhancing

deterrence on the Korean Peninsula and ROK-U.S. combined defense capabilities.

He stated that the U.S. will continue to provide significant bridging capabilities

until the ROK obtains a fully independent defense capability. The Secretary

further noted that the U.S. will continue to contribute U.S. unique capabilities to

the combined defense for the life of the Alliance. Both sides pledged the fullest

commitment to meeting agreed-to benchmarks and timelines regarding the

transition.

Cooperation Committee (SCC), the Defense Technology and Industrial Cooperation

Committee (DTICC), and the Logistics Cooperation Committee (LCC)). They noted

that the DTICC had been given increased stature by raising the level of the Co
Chairs to the Under Secretary/Vice Minister level. They also acknowledged that as

the Alliance evolves, the SCM subcommittee structure must be examined and

adjusted to meet current needs, and agreed that the SPI would develop

recommendations for consideration at the 39th SCM.

through intense discussions on issues pertinent to the realignment of the Alliance

and the conclusion of the joint studies on the development of the future ROK-U.S.

Alliance, strongly supported the continuous development of a future-oriented

Alliance. Both sides agreed to hold the 39th SCM at a mutually convenient time in
