Foreword

The first quarter of the 21st century is a period in which the
incompatibility between social, economic, and political structures
transformed by digital data and algorithms and the notions of the
analogue era comes to light. The radical transformative impact of
rapidly developing artificial intelligence powered systems on production
processes, occupations, daily life and institutional structures has brought
mankind to the brink of a new age. With their ever-expanding scope
of application, artificial intelligence technologies are expected to have
a greater impact on the global economic structure than the Internet
revolution.

Al-Jazari of Şırnak, who is considered the founder of cybernetics,
achieved the “impossible” for his time with the hydraulic machines he
developed centuries ago. As the Thessaloniki Ordinarius Professor Cahit
Arf, who took the first contemporary step towards artificial intelligence
in our country, emphasized in his 1959 presentation titled “Can Machines
Think and How?”: “finding a way to our desire for knowledge depends
on the spread of confidence in reason”. Many Turkish citizens of similar
traits working both in Türkiye and abroad from the past to the present
have been contributing to the advancements in the field of artificial
intelligence. With this confidence, we believe that the time has come
for our country to make a new breakthrough in the field of artificial
intelligence.

We are living in a period where all countries are taking serious steps
towards the potential gains of artificial intelligence. However, artificial
intelligence technologies, which have many opportunities to offer in
terms of socioeconomic development, also bring some uncertainties
and risks to the agenda. Unknowingly, we are transforming from
people struggling with nature to individuals stuck among algorithms.
In addition, artificial intelligence systems trained with our codified
preferences, judgments and, discourses also lead human beings to
question themselves. This situation is actually an opportunity for our
nation. We will take steps beyond shaping our development paradigm
around economic welfare and public order in the field of artificial
intelligence.

Taking part in the field of artificial intelligence is not a matter of choice
as it is one of the strongest pillars of our development goals in line
with the “Digital Türkiye” vision and the “National Technology Move”.
By designing artificial intelligence systems with an understanding
reflecting the development and operation of artificial intelligence
systems in accordance with our common values, we have the opportunity
to add value to the entire humanity by making a new techno-economic
breakthrough combined with our deep-rooted civilization experience.

The National Artificial Intelligence Strategy is a comprehensive effort, to
which all the relevant stakeholders have contributed in order to support
this transformation that is currently being experienced on a global scale
and fed by artificial intelligence technologies, on behalf of humanity and
to ensure that our country benefits from this process to the maximum
extent possible.

I would like to thank all public institutions and organizations,
non-governmental organizations, academics, and private sector
representatives who contributed to the preparation of the Strategy,
especially the Digital Transformation Office and the Ministry of Industry
and Technology. I wish that the National Artificial Intelligence Strategy,
which we will be implementing with the contribution of all relevant
parties in the next five years will yield auspicious outcomes for our
country.

Executive
Summary

The National Artificial Intelligence Strategy (NAIS) was prepared in line with the Eleventh
Development Plan and the Presidential Annual Program for 2021. The Strategy determines
the measures that will put our country's efforts in the domain of artificial intelligence (AI) on
a common ground between the years 2021-2025 and the governance mechanism that will be
established to implement these measures.


NAIS was prepared by the Digital Transformation Office of the Presidency of the Republic of
Türkiye (DTO) and the Ministry of Industry and Technology (MoIT) in accordance with “Measure
473.1” in the Presidential Annual Program for 2021. NAIS is of an exploratory nature since it is the
first national strategy of our country in this field and due to the rapid advancements in AI and the
evolution of strategies in other countries over time. The strategic priorities, objectives, measures,
and governance mechanisms determined in this context have been designed to respond to the
opportunities, risks, and uncertainties that may arise for our country over time.

As part of NAIS preparations, interviews were conducted with public institutions, universities,
private sector organizations, NGOs, and international organizations on physical and online
platforms, workshops were held and domain experts of different disciplines were asked to
provide their evaluations. In this framework, the Strategy was finalized by taking into account
the global trends shaped by the paradigm shift in economic and social life that emerged due to
AI, as well as the recent situation and development goals of our country. In this context, the vision
of NAIS was determined as: creating value on a global scale with an agile and sustainable AI
**ecosystem for a prosperous Türkiye.** In order to realize this vision, NAIS was designed around
6 strategic priorities in line with both national policies and needs along with the AI strategy
recommendations of international organizations:

**Figure 1 National AI Strategy Vision and Strategic Priorities**


-----

Within the framework of these strategic priorities, **24 objectives** and 119 measures were
formulated. These objectives and measures outline the actions that the implementing institutions
will determine in detail. The priorities of the NAIS, as well as the objectives and measures
determined in this context, have been designed in harmony with our country's vision of “Digital
Türkiye” and the “National Technology Move”.

As the domain of AI technologies expands, the compliance pressure on individual habits,
ways of doing business, professions, and institutional structures triggers a radical transformation
in the socioeconomic structure. Although it is clear that this transformation has started and
will continue to accelerate, the means and speed of the interaction of this transformation with
existing social, institutional, and economic structures are unclear. Therefore, it is inevitable that a
long-term national strategy to be determined in the field of AI, where such uncertainties exist, is
to be based on the creation of an ecosystem that experiments, discovers, learns, and constantly
updates itself accordingly. Moreover, in order to adapt Türkiye's socioeconomic structure to rapid
developments in AI, it is necessary to act prudently enough not to make major mistakes on the
one hand, and act quickly enough to take advantage of opportunities on the other. In this regard,
the structure of NAIS is suitable for both experimenting and implementing, and it aims to create
an agile and sustainable ecosystem that can manage the transformation in the socioeconomic
structure and reduce possible inefficiencies in the functioning of this ecosystem as much as
possible. Due to the above-mentioned uncertainties and the ongoing dynamic process, it will be
necessary to review the needs, possibilities, and opportunities and shape the steps accordingly
during the implementation period of the NAIS. It is observed that other countries have updated
their strategy documents in the process because of similar needs. Due to all these reasons, the
common points in NAIS and the guides planned to be prepared in this context are living and
constantly evolving references.

The focus of NAIS is on strategic consistency and end-to-end governance, which will have
repercussions at the inter-institutional and internal level, with competence areas consisting
of quality data, advanced skills, and technical infrastructure. Thanks to the measures to be
implemented, it is aimed to create value from data through AI applications at institutions and
at the sectoral level, to carry out AI projects effectively, and to increase the maturity level of our
country's AI ecosystem within this framework.

In line with this main focus and objectives;

-  The employment of researchers and practitioners to develop organizational
competencies in AI will be supported throughout all public organizations, especially
in central public institutions, as well as the private sector and universities. Efforts
to increase the quality and quantity of employment in AI by enriching the training
content, including the existing online platforms, will be carried out with the private
sector, relevant NGOs, and universities. Professional definitions and competencies
will be determined for the development of skills in the field of AI. With new
undergraduate, graduate, and supporting research programs to be launched at
universities, the number of new graduates with domain-specific competencies
will be increased. Incentives for increasing scientific productivity in the field of AI
will be improved. Thematic programs in which pre-higher education students will
receive training on algorithmic and critical thinking, ethics, and AI applications will
be generalized.

-  Steps will be taken to increase the number and quality of AI start-ups. In this context,
cooperation with start-up networks, technology development, innovation, and


-----

incubation centers will be strengthened. Activation of AI-oriented venture capital
funds will be prioritized. In this direction, public incentives and supports specifically
addressing the field will be improved. Interdisciplinary projects will be brought to
the fore by establishing clusters and centers of excellence where advanced R&D
activities can be carried out.

-  Administrative, legal, and technical works on easy access to quality data, which is
essential for AI projects and activities, and secure data sharing between institutions
and sectors will be carried out. Testing and implementation processes of AI products
and services will be improved through infrastructures that are in operation and those
that will be newly established for high performance computing, ready platforms,
data storage, rapid transmission, and secure sharing. The capacity of existing R&D
centers will be improved, and commercialization processes will be accelerated by
emphasizing collaborations with public institutions and organizations, the private
sector and universities. Thanks to the Open Government Data Portal and the
National Data Dictionary, the data quality of public institutions will be increased
and production and sharing of anonymized datasets will be accelerated. A “Public
Data Space” will be established to ensure secure data governance among public
institutions. In order to generate more value from this data, activities that support
external participation and develop the open-source ecosystem will be carried out.

-  Researches will be carried out to ensure the adaptation of administrative and
legal regulations to AI-induced socioeconomic transformation and to evaluate its
possible consequences beforehand. Activities addressing ethical and legal aspects
of AI applications will be carried out, and international studies in this field will be
followed. By creating regulatory sandboxes and test-beds, the development, testing,
and commercialization processes will be facilitated for start-ups. Data capacity will
be improved to better understand and track transformation dynamics.

-  Our country will be ensured to participate actively in trustworthy and responsible AI
studies carried out at the international level. In addition, activities will be carried out
to launch international projects in our country, and cooperation with international
organizations will be supported. Participation in projects with cross-border calls,
particularly the multi-annual financial frameworks of the European Union and the
Union Programs within this scope, will be encouraged.

-  Structural and workforce transformation of public institutions and private sector
organizations will be supported in line with the developments in AI. AI Maturity
Model and AI Project Management Guide will be prepared to accelerate the
structural transformation and put it on a healthy footing. With the Public AI
Platform to be offered as a service, the pre-implementation preparation process
and experience transfer will be facilitated. It will be ensured to create problem
pools and identify usage scenarios for both public institutions and the private
sector. The Trustworthy AI Seal approach will be tested to encourage the use of
reference models in application development and operation. Considering the new
professions emerging with AI, training and certification programs for the existing
workforce will be carried out with sectoral collaborations.

The action plans to be implemented within the scope of the measures outlined above will be
prepared by the responsible public institutions under the coordination of the DTO and the MoIT.


-----

A two-layered governance mechanism has been established in order to effectively
implement the measures and action plans to be prepared within the scope of NAIS. The first
layer will coordinate strategically, while the second layer will coordinate at the administrative
and technical levels. In the first layer, high-level coordination and decision-making mechanisms
are involved, while the technical and administrative mechanisms for the effective design and
execution of the works to be implemented in accordance with the NAIS will be created in the
second layer.

On the other hand, two different AI development environments will be established for public
institutions and organizations and the common use of the AI ecosystem. In this context, the
“Public AI Ecosystem” to be implemented under the coordination of the Digital Transformation
Office Big Data and AI Department, will ensure following and supporting AI and advanced
analytics projects of central and local government institutions and organizations in line with the
guidelines to be prepared.

In addition, under the coordination of the MoIT General Directorate of National Technology
Department of Digital Technologies; “Sectoral Co-Creation Laboratories” will be established
within the TÜBİTAK Artificial Intelligence Institute for the common use of the AI ecosystem.
These laboratories, which will be expanded in line with the needs, will support institutions with
infrastructure and data spaces to be provided for them so that multi-stakeholder sectoral AI
applications can be developed and tested. The laboratories will facilitate institutions defining
problems, creating usage scenarios, sharing and annotating data, and meeting with domain
experts and industry representatives.

In this document, the definitions of the concepts and related technologies in the field of AI
are also included in the Annex in order to establish a common language in terms of the concepts
used.

The high-level objectives foreseen to be reached in 2025, which is the end of the
implementation period of NAIS, are as below:

-  The contribution of AI to GDP will be raised to 5%.

-  Employment in the field of AI will be increased to 50,000 people.

-  Employment in the field of AI in central and local government institutions and
organizations will be increased to 1,000 people.

-  The number of graduate-level diploma holders in the field of AI will be increased to
10,000 people.

-  AI applications developed by the local ecosystem will be prioritized in public
procurement and commercialization will be supported.

-  Contribution will be provided actively to the regulatory studies and standardization
processes of international organizations in the field of trustworthy and responsible
AI and cross-border data sharing.

-  It will be ensured that Türkiye ranks among the top 20 countries in international AI
indexes.

**What is Artificial Intelligence?**

In its most general form, AI is defined as the ability of a computer or computer-controlled
robot to perform various activities in a manner similar to that of intelligent creatures. The term AI is
used for systems equipped with human cognitive abilities such as reasoning, meaning discovery,
generalization or learning from past experiences in dynamic and uncertain environments.

AI is a discipline that is fed by other digital technologies, especially big data and computation,
and also neuroscience. AI-powered systems use advanced algorithms that learn from the
features and patterns in the data, can be updated accordingly, and are able to search and make
predictions.

The rapid development and spread of high performance computing, cloud computing,
the Internet of Things, and blockchain technologies in recent years have paved the way for the
emergence of new AI techniques and applications. Similarly, thanks to big data techniques used
in processing digital data, large datasets are made available to AI applications. The development
of quantum computing technology will enable solving much more complex problems using AI.
It is expected that future developments in the aforementioned technology fields will lead to a
wider range of applications for AI and performance improvement in the domain.

On the other hand, although AI benefits from neuroscience, contrary to its name, its
functioning mechanism does not resemble the working and conceptualization structure of
the human brain. For this reason, the concept of AI is divided into three categories: “narrow”,
“general” and “super” AI. AI systems cannot perform multitasking in a single, human-like body
yet. While AI systems can be successful in carrying out routine, procedural, and patterned
analytical intelligence tasks, their use is very limited in tasks involving emotional intelligence and
high uncertainty that require design, empathy, and adaptability. In this context, conceptual and
technical discussions on the limits and future of AI continue as well.

More detailed explanations about AI technologies and their historical evolution and
definitions of terms and concepts used in the NAIS are provided in the Appendix.

**Overview of the National Artificial Intelligence Strategy**

Since the end of the 1990s, various policies for the information society have been
implemented in our country, and with the transition to the Presidential Government System
in 2018, the importance of digital transformation was brought to a higher level. In this context,
the realization of “Digital Türkiye” has begun to be strongly emphasized on both political and
administrative grounds. The Digital Türkiye vision aims for a globally competitive Türkiye with the
increase in productivity it provides by using digital technology, products and services in social,
economic, and public activities, and the value it creates from data. On the other hand, the effect
of turmoil and structural transformations in the global economy has resulted in the localization of
critical technologies becoming an important political priority for both increasing social welfare and
strengthening national security. In this context, policies and practices that will increase Türkiye's
global competitiveness, strengthen its economic and technological independence, and provide
breakthroughs in critical technologies have been structured under the **“National Technology**
**Move” as an objection to monopolization in scientific and technological developments.**

In this framework, it is the common goal of the Digital Türkiye vision and the National
Technology Move to contribute to the establishment of an economic order in our country based
on innovation and creating value from data, by implementing AI in all areas of socioeconomic life
and increasing locality in the development of AI technologies.

In line with this common goal, AI was determined as one of the critical technology areas for
our country in the Eleventh Development Plan and the 2023 Industry and Technology Strategy.
Measure No. 473.1 of the 2021 Presidential Annual Program prepared within the framework of the
Eleventh Development Plan commissioned the preparation of the National Artificial Intelligence
Strategy to the DTO and MoIT.

The maturity level that AI technologies have reached today and future expectations regarding
effects of these technologies in different application areas require that policies and strategies
in areas such as digital government, cyber security, smart cities, broadband infrastructure,
manufacturing industry, software industry, education, and employment should be taken into
account during the preparation of a national strategy document on AI. In this context, NAIS was
prepared in line with the Digital Türkiye vision, the National Technology Move, and high-level
national policy documents, taking into account sectoral and thematic strategy documents.

**Determination of Strategic Priority Areas**

While determining the strategic priority areas of the NAIS, the priorities highlighted in
our country’s national policy documents and sectoral and thematic strategies were taken
into account. In addition, the tendencies and approaches of international organizations in the
field of AI, other relevant national strategy documents prepared by various countries, and the
measurement methodologies of international benchmarking studies were also evaluated.

Various international organizations are setting recommendations and priorities to
advance the transformative impact of AI on the socioeconomic structure in a constructive
way. Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Council adopted
_Recommendation on Artificial Intelligence, which our country is a party to and was later_
recognized by the G20 and the European Union (EU), provides recommendations on “researchdevelopment”, “digital ecosystem”, “regulatory framework”, “AI domain experts”, “labor market”
and “international cooperation” to the countries.[1 ]


-----

Considering the strategies of EU countries, policy headings regarding “AI domain experts”,
“transition from laboratory to market”, “networking for generalization”, “regulation” and
“infrastructure” stand out.[2] Similarly, the World Economic Forum (WEF) recommends focusing
on the areas of “capacity”, “investment”, “adoption”, “expansion” and “regulation”.[3]

Similar headings stand out in international comparison studies as well. In the Government AI
_Readiness Index Report prepared by Oxford Insights and the International Development Research_
Center (IDRC), it is seen that analyzes are made on 3 the main axes of “public administration”,
“technology sector” and “data and infrastructure”.[4]

The AI Index Report prepared by Stanford University Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence
Institute is based on “research and development”, “economy” and “inclusion”.[5] Another study is
the Global AI Index prepared by Tortoise Media, which includes comparisons made within the
scope of “investment”, “innovation” and “implementation” axes.[6]

It is evident that the main axes are similar in the national policy and strategy documents of
various countries.[7, 8]

In the Conceptual Report prepared by the Informatics Association of Türkiye on Opinions and
_Proposals for the Development of Artificial Intelligence in Türkiye, the challenges of our country_
in the field of AI were evaluated under the headings of “infrastructure”, “human resources”,
“stakeholder roles”, “legal and ethical dimensions”, “standards”, “data sharing” and “strategies”,
and solutions were proposed. In this direction, it is suggested to focus on the creation of an AI
ecosystem and its integration into international systems, the development of AI technologies in
Türkiye, discussing the legal and ethical dimensions of AI, and creating solutions.[9]

The adopted AI policies mainly focus on the following 6 main areas of influence according to
the aforementioned studies:

-  **Training experts equipped with advanced AI skills and harmonization of the**
**education system in this context: Artificial intelligence is related to many technical**
fields such as cloud computing, robotics, Internet of Things, augmented reality, data
science, cyber security and is affected by developments in them. Therefore, both
the development of AI technologies and the successful implementation of these
technologies in all sectors require researchers and practitioners with advanced
technical skills.

-  **Increasing the number of R&D studies in the field of AI, developing**
**entrepreneurship, providing access to high-quality data and technical**
**infrastructure: Intense R&D studies, pre-competitive collaborations, and innovative**
initiatives are required in order to be successful in AI since the field is newly
developing. In this context, regulation of intellectual property rights in line with the
changing needs is also important for the sustainability of innovation. In addition,
since the development and implementation of AI technologies requires data
collection, storage, sharing, and processing on a large scale, secure and scalable
technical infrastructures and governance mechanisms should be established to
allow this.

-  **Establishing an appropriate ethical and legal framework for AI: AI technologies**
becoming more common and widespread is changing the expectations and
assumptions about human-machine interactions. For the first time in history,
identity, rights, values, and responsibilities for human-made objects have


-----

become the subject of intense debates. The implementation of AI technologies
also raises privacy and national security concerns in many cases. In addition, the
widespread use of AI-powered autonomous or semi-autonomous decision-making
mechanisms raises ethical problems such as the protection of human rights and
the prevention of discrimination. Therefore, building an effective AI ecosystem
requires establishing an appropriate ethical and legal framework that takes into
account the technological nature of AI.

-  **Developing international cooperation in the field of AI:** Thanks to the effect of
remote working methods facilitated by current technologies, it is possible to reach
competent workforce anywhere in the world. In addition, it is possible to develop
more successful AI technologies and applications through the joint use of data
repositories with domain experts and technical infrastructure resources that
belong to different countries. Moreover, the development of AI technologies and
the collection of large-scale data that usually belongs to the citizens of different
countries, cause tensions between large technology companies and the countries
that own the data, leading to discussions on digital sovereignty. Therefore, there is
a need to develop international cooperation in the field of AI in order to manage
the above-mentioned tensions and benefit more from AI technologies on a global
scale.

-  **Managing the impact of AI on employment and professions: Since AI technologies**
facilitate the automation of routine and repetitive jobs, there are extensive
discussions on various platforms regarding issues such as preventing employment
losses that may occur in large segments of society working in such jobs;
communication, creativity and group working skills necessary to be productive
in a work environment where AI is heavily used; current and next generation of
employees gaining the ability to work with machines; impact of remote and flexible
working models on the current labor market and employer-employee relations as
well as social security systems. In this context, in order to protect and strengthen the
innovation and productivity of the national economy in the age of AI, it is necessary
to ensure the adaptation of existing employees to the new working environment
that has emerged with the generalization of AI technologies, to manage the social
tensions that will arise in this process, and to equip the youth with competencies
suitable for the labor market of the future.

-  **Transforming institutions and companies with AI applications:** Thanks to AI
technologies, it is possible to make proactive decisions by processing a large amount
of collected data on the inputs used in business processes, products, and services.
This situation presents opportunities in terms of increasing competitiveness by
increasing productivity both at the company and country scale. In order to realize
this potential, effective measures need to be taken on several issues such as
technical infrastructures that need to be created at sector and/or company scale,
applications that have to be developed, the workforce that has to be trained, and
business processes that have to be redesigned. In this context, it is important to
establish multi-stakeholder coordination mechanisms.

NAIS has been designed around the “organizational competence”, “strategic consistency” and
“governance” dimensions within the framework of strategic priorities determined by considering
the above-mentioned impact areas and our country’s national, sectoral, and thematic policies
and strategies. As shown in Figure 2, NAIS focuses on three core AI competencies, namely “skills”,
“data” and “infrastructure”. The organizational competence dimension focuses on activities aimed


-----

at increasing the maturity of core competencies within institutions. The governance dimension
aims to provide administrative and technical coordination within and between institutions
for the continuous development of basic competencies. Finally, the strategic consistency
dimension complements the organizational competence and governance dimensions and
aims to coordinate at the levels of public policy, NAIS, sectoral transformation, and international
organization for the sustainability of the AI ecosystem.

NAIS defines the strategic measures that will enable to follow a maturation route that starts
with raising awareness for individuals, companies, and public institutions and progresses as
testing, implementing, managing, and finally realizing the structural transformation. For this
purpose, these measures have been grouped under the following strategic priority areas:

-  AI Experts and Employment in the Domain

-  Research, Entrepreneurship, and Innovation

-  Technical Infrastructure, Platforms, and Data

-  Harmonization and Regulations in Socioeconomic Structure

-  International Cooperation

-  Structural and Workforce Transformation

**Global Artificial Intelligence Market**

AI technologies and AI-powered systems find applications in all sectors. As such, the social
and economic opportunities have become increasingly evident and led to the start of global
competition in the field. There are many studies that predict/estimate different global AI market
sizes. The common point of them is that the market is predicted to grow rapidly; being positively
separated from other technologies in this respect.

It is estimated that global spending on AI reached approximately US$50 in 2020. The market
size is expected to exceed US$110 billion by 2024, with an annual growth rate of 20.1%. Software
has the largest share in expenditures among hardware, software and services, and annual growth
in the field is expected to be 22.5% in the next 5 years. Customer services, sales processes, cyber
security threat detection and fraud analysis applications are at the forefront of the prominent
usage areas. By 2025, 90% of new enterprise software is expected to embed AI functionality. It is
also a general trend to add AI functionality to existing software. It is predicted that the growth
rate of innovative and AI-based applications will be approximately 10%. By 2025, most user
interfaces are expected to use AI through computer vision, voice assistants, natural language
processing and augmented reality.[10] It is estimated that more than 3 billion smart devices feature
voice assistants in use in 2019 and that this number will reach 9 billion in the next 5 years.[11]

The field of AI is expected to grow by 13-14%, contributing US$13 - 15.7 trillion to the global
economy by 2030. It is thought that the anticipated contribution will be due to the increase
in productivity to be achieved with the help of automated processes and improved workforce,
as well as personalization and product enrichment in line with consumer expectations. In this
process, the USA and China are expected to make the largest contribution with an increase
that is above the average.[12,13] It is foreseen that the impact of AI technologies will not be limited
to only certain sectors and ways of doing business, but will deeply affect the entire economy.
The largest share of AI-driven global economic growth is expected to be in consumer goods,
accommodation, and food services, with 15%. The second-largest growth is estimated to be 12.5%
in the “technology, media, and communication” sector.[11]


-----

**Artificial Intelligence Strategies Worldwide**

As of today, more than 60 countries have published their AI strategy. The socioeconomic
benefits of AI have led to the start of a global race that involves many countries. AI has become
one of the main areas of competition and cooperation between countries. Several national policy
and strategy documents on AI have been published since 2016. The USA, South Korea and China
were among the main countries to publish their national AI strategies in 2016; followed by Canada,
Japan and Singapore in 2017; Germany, France, India and the UK in 2018; and Russia in 2019.
The first examples of strategy documents were R&D-oriented. To this day, they have gradually
become unique plans covering the socioeconomic structure.

While some countries invest heavily in AI technologies to stay ahead of the AI competition,
others take a more cautious approach. Countries that increasingly realize the economic and
strategic importance of AI are investing significantly in AI-based applications. Having published
their AI strategies between 2016 - 2019, leading countries in the field, namely the USA, China,
United Kingdom, France and Germany, set their priority objectives as increasing investments,
expanding application areas by making public their resources, and activating the R&D capacity
and the workforce using AI. There are many common points among the objectives of the countries
that have published their AI strategies:

-  Emphasis on cooperation among AI ecosystem actors is an important feature
shared by all strategy documents.

-  The focus is on increasing investments, expanding the fields of application by
opening up resources, and activating the R&D capacity and the workforce that
uses AI.

-  Human centricity and the development of ethical principles are determined as
common values and the necessity of international cooperation is emphasized.

-  The expansion of digital infrastructures such as 5G, fiber networks, high performance
computing facilities and data centers, open-source software libraries and financial
incentives in this direction is guaranteed.

AI has begun to take its place in government organizations as well. While some countries are
establishing separate AI offices, others are assigning responsibility for AI applications to existing
ministries and offices.

**Global Developments and Trends in the Scope of**
**Strategic Priority Areas**

**AI Experts and Employment in the Domain**

Globally, AI hiring has been growing rapidly in recent years. Although international
occupational classifications are not yet available, total employment in AI is estimated to
approach 250,000 as of 2019. Compared to 2015, it is estimated that there is a 5-fold increase in
AI employment in Information Technologies units, and a 2-fold increase in other service units.[11]
This situation also indicates the increasing need for sectoral experience and domain knowledge
of AI experts.

AI employment growth also differs across countries. Figure 3 compares the hiring percentage
of professional business platform members with any AI skills listed in their profile between 20152016 versus 2019. Singapore ranks first in the list, and the rate of AI hiring in 2019 is 3 times higher
compared to the average of 2015-2016. It is noteworthy that Türkiye ranks high on this list.[5]

**Figure 3. AI Hiring Index by Country[5]**

On the other hand, over 60% of AI PhD graduates went to the industry in 2018, up from 20% in
2004.[5] This indicates that academic knowledge in the field of AI is rapidly transferring to industry
and production processes.

The number and impact value of the articles written by academia-private sector collaborations
are also informative in this respect. Figure 4 shows the number of articles published with the
collaboration of the academy-private sector and their impact values as of the end of 2019 for
various countries. According to the figure, the USA is very successful in terms of both the number
of articles and impact value. Although United Kingdom, Germany and China are the countries
with the closest number of articles to the USA, their impact values are lower. On the other hand,
although the number of articles published under the cooperation of the academia-private sector
in Hong Kong, Switzerland and Singapore is less than in the USA, their impact values are higher.


-----

Considering all the countries in the figure, it can be said that Türkiye is slightly above the average
in terms of both article and impact value.

**Figure 4. Number of Academy-Corporate Collaboration AI Papers and AI Citation Impacts of Countries, 2014-2018[5]**

Looking at the regional distribution of publications in the field of AI, it is seen that most
publications are from European countries. China published 10% of global AI publications in 2000
and this rate increased to 28% in 2018. However, the USA is the leader according to the H-index
that is used to indicate scientific productivity and efficiency. The USA is the leader in computer
vision, machine learning, data mining, and natural language processing research. Also, the USA
is 40% above the global average number of citations.[5]

Looking at the 2019 international collaboration publications shown in Figure 5, it is seen that
the two leading countries of the field, the USA and China, are in the first two places.[7] The USA and
China are followed by the EU, UK, and Australia.

In terms of AI expertise, according to WEF's analysis shown in Figure 6; employment growth in

the field of “Data and AI”, which is seen among the 7 emerging occupational clusters, is projected

to be higher than in other clusters. As of 2022, 123 of 10,000 new jobs are expected to be from this

cluster. Looking at the skill sets required for the occupation cluster, we can see that the skill set

that will be most needed will be “advanced technology” knowledge with approximately 45%.[14]

**Figure 6. Share of Skills Sets That Will Be In Demand Worldwide in Data and AI Professional Cluster, 2022[1][4]**

The development of advanced digital skills in AI and attracting talent from the whole world

to the region are among the strategic priorities of the EU. In this context, the “Skills Agenda” was

updated to develop the competencies necessary for green and digital transformation in the EU.

Many countries carry out efforts for accelerating R&D activities and the establishment

of national AI centers and research institutes in order to train the qualified human resources

necessary for AI works. China and Canada are creating “talent pools” consisting of competent

people in AI. The United Kingdom has established scholarships, certificates, and training

programs for AI researchers to provide more researchers to the institute. France, the USA, India,

Japan, and Russia have also announced that they have undergoing efforts to develop advanced

skills in the domain.


-----

France and Germany declared the importance of attracting AI researchers to the region in
cooperation with the EU, and that they will create the conditions that will enable EU countries to
become centers of attraction. Likewise, China aims to be a center of attraction in this regard as
well. In order to create a suitable environment for AI research, the United Kingdom provided the
private sector with the investments needed by establishing public-private sector partnerships.

Despite all these ongoing efforts on a global scale, the shortage of AI experts is growing
rapidly. There are differences between developed and developing countries in the last 5 years.
Some of the professions with the fastest growing demand on a global scale are AI experts, data
scientists, big data architects and software robot engineers.[15]

The lack of qualified employees in AI around the world leads countries to take special
measures to make up for this shortage. For example, South Korea has announced that it plans to
open 6 graduate schools in AI and train 5,000 AI experts by 2022.

The tendency of AI experts to work in a country different from the one they were trained in
is also striking. According to research, one-third of the world's AI experts work in a country other
than the country where they received their PhD.[16]

Countries allocate significant resources for the creation of qualified workforce in AI. For
example, the United Kingdom plans to train more than 1,000 government-sponsored doctoral
researchers by 2025 and to award Turing scholarships to support the first group of AI scholars,
while China has launched a five-year university program to train at least 500 teachers and 5,000
students to work on AI technologies. This program will be carried out within the framework of
cooperation between government institutions, private companies and universities. As part of the
“AI + X” program, China has launched a program to open 50 world-class training and research
institutions, 50 national-level high-quality online open courses, and 50 AI faculties.

The USA is planning grant support of US$200 million for STEM+A education focused on
computer science. France seeks to triple the number of AI graduates in three years by offering
new courses and doubling the starting salaries of AI researchers in public institutions. It also aims
to attract talent from all over the world to the country by significant salary increases that improve
the quality of life and reducing bureaucratic requirements.

**Research, Entrepreneurship and Innovation**

The number of AI start-ups around the world is growing rapidly. Between 2014 and 2019, an
average of US$8.6 million per start-up was invested in a total of 15,798 AI start-ups around the
world. During this period, investments in AI start-ups increased by an average of 48% annually.
Cyber threat hunting, drug discovery, network optimization and advanced health biometrics
are the prominent areas among AI start-ups. In 2019, global private sector investment in AI has
reached US$78 billion. Figure 7 shows that approximately half of the total investment for 2019
in terms of investment types was made by venture capital driven private investment and that
merger and acquisition operations constitute an important investment item. On the other hand,
the top 3 fields where the total investments made are autonomous vehicles (9.9%), drug and

cancer studies (6.1%) and facial recognition (6.0%).[5]

**Figure 7. Distribution of Private Sector AI Investments Worldwide, 2019[5]**

60% of the world's AI start-ups are from the USA and China. As of 2018, the number of AI

companies is 2,028 in the US and 1,011 in China. In recent years, the acquisition of technology

startups by global-scale companies as a growth strategy has been on the rise, especially in AI. For

example, there were 8 acquisitions in 2010 and this number increased to 231 in 2019.[11]

Patent applications for AI technologies and applications have been increasing rapidly as

well. Scientific publications started gaining momentum in the early 2000s and there has been

a significant increase in practical patents after 2010. Looking at the patent filings between 1980

and 2016, it is seen that the most important AI application fields are communication (24%),

transportation (24%) and health sciences (19%).[17]

The number of agreements made as venture capitals indicates that angel/seed, early-stage

and late-stage investments have decreased in the first half of 2020 compared to the previous

year, but the interest of venture capital funds in AI is high despite the global economic recession.[18]

The AI strategies being followed differ depending on the economic strength of the countries

and their research and entrepreneurship competencies. In this context;

-  The USA has defined its goal as maintaining global leadership and announced

that it will increase its AI investment budget by 70% in 2021, excluding the defense

industry.

-  To become the “World Leader”, China has set a target for the core AI industry to be

worth US$140 billion and the AI industry to be worth US$1.4 trillion by 2030.

-  South Korea has announced that it aims to be one of the leading AI countries in the

world by aiming to invest approximately US$2 billion between 2017 and 2022. The

sectors that South Korea will invest in are autonomous cars, smart factories, drones,

smart cities with smart infrastructure and green energy, which will also open the

door to developments in AI.

-  Israel aims to become one of the top five countries in the world in AI. Their funding

for AI is US$500 million annually. Israel stands out with over 1,400 AI start-ups in

machine learning, deep learning and robotics. In 2018, 40% of investments in the

start-up ecosystem were AI-based.


-----

-  Aiming to create an AI education and training ecosystem to develop and attract
the best AI talents, France has announced that it will allocate €1.5 billion for AI
development by the end of 2022. France is trying to set its innovation course with
“innovative regulatory sandboxes” that will offer resources for testing use cases. It is
predicted that AI research institutes in the country will be equipped with specially
designed supercomputers for researchers.

-  Having signed an “Artificial Intelligence Strategy Agreement” with the private
sector, the UK aims to invest a total of US$1.5 billion, together with the private
sector's contribution by 2025, and to increase its total R&D investment to 2.4% of
GDP by 2027.

-  Germany has allocated a budget of €3 billion until 2025 to maintain Germany's
competitiveness in the future by making Europe a leading center in the field of AI.

Countries also seek to develop regional R&D partnerships between universities, large
companies and industry investors to enhance the AI research and entrepreneurship ecosystem:

-  India aims to be the “CERN” of AI by opening its data to researchers to increase
the global inclusiveness of AI solutions. Academic entrepreneurship is addressed
through mechanisms such as the development of private e-cells in institutions
such as IIT Bombay, IIT Madras and IIM Ahmedabad.

-  Japan allocates significant resources to AI research, development and applications.
For example, US$550 million will be allocated to the field through the CSTI ImpPACT
program.

-  British Telecom has partnered with 15 universities across the UK to build AI-powered
next-generation data infrastructure.

**Technical Infrastructure, Platforms and Data**

The global data volume, which is 55ZB[i] today, is expected to reach 143ZB cumulatively in
2024. In other words, by 2025, there will be 19TB of data per person on average in the world. It is
foreseen that the data to be produced in the next 3 years will be more than the data produced in
the last 30 years. Although entertainment/personal (45%) and non-entertainment/public images
(35%) constitute the majority of existing data, it is predicted that productivity/embedded system
data (15%) will increase rapidly in 5 years and reach 30% of the total data volume due to digital
transformation in the economy.[19] This increase and change in data volume should be expected
to drive a similar trend in the demand for AI products and services.

In order to conduct AI research and develop applications, both large-scale datasets in
the relevant field and high-capacity informatics infrastructures that can process said data are
needed. Since it is extremely difficult for individual stakeholders in the AI ecosystem to acquire
these resources, countries often focus on building high performance computing infrastructures
and open-source data and software libraries that can be used jointly, and try to improve data
sharing among stakeholders in the ecosystem.

i 1 Zettabyte (ZB) equals 10[21 ]bytes or 1 billion Terabytes (TB).


-----

International organizations, on the other hand, aim to steer the field with structures such

as technical working groups established specifically for certain issues, as well as making policy

recommendations. For example, the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) has the “Focus

Group on Machine Learning for Future Networks”, which aims to draft the technical specifications

for machine learning for next-generation wireless communication networks. Overhaul of existing

communication networks that were not designed with big data analysis and machine learning

studies in mind is among the works of ITU.

Recently, the EU has started to finance cross-border projects on the use of big data. One of

these projects is the Meaningful Integration of Data Analytics and Services (MIDAS). The purpose

of this platform is to collect, map, manage, model, process and use existing heterogeneous

healthcare data and other government data, along with external open data, to enable the

creation of evidence-based, actionable information. The platform is expected to guide long-term

policies better and enable the delivery of health services at the regional, national, and EU levels.

The widespread use of open government data in OECD member countries also positively

affects the development and use of AI technologies. More countries are expressing that they

have findings showing that open government data has an impact on the development and use

of AI technologies. Based on these findings, the OECD recommends that efforts be made to

establish standard frameworks for data formats and publication procedures, promoting higher

data quality and accessibility for open government data, and mechanisms to allow feedback and

suggestions from open data users.[20]

Considering the importance of the reuse of data held by different stakeholders for the

development of new products and services in the field of AI, the European Commission has

published the Communiqué Towards a Common European Data Space in order to support the

establishment of common data spaces at the EU scale.[21] The Communiqué, which was created in

line with the current data protection legislation, makes recommendations for the establishment

of common data space in order to create an uninterrupted digital space that will enable the

development of new data-based products and services in the EU. The Commission aims to

improve access to privately-held data through industrial and personal data platforms, within the

framework of data sharing and reuse agreements, in common data spaces.

Having global-scale technology companies with access to comprehensive data that can

efficiently develop and apply AI technologies and applications in various fields, the USA has a

significant advantage in this area. There are also innovation centers in the USA, where dynamic

start-ups operate alongside the large technology companies in Silicon Valley. Universities and

research institutions both conduct their own research and contribute to the product development

of these companies by accessing the data of these technology companies. The USA also works

to facilitate the creation of open-source software libraries and toolkits (such as Open NLP,

Weka toolkit), thus aiming to facilitate access to data and technology resources needed for the

development of AI products.

Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology operates an Artificial Intelligence

Center that focuses on research in areas such as brain research, machine learning, quantum

computing, multimodal perception and interaction, natural language processing, emotional

intelligence, smart chips. It plans to invest approximately US$1.2 billion between 2017 and 2022

for these researches. The South Korean government also wants all public institutions to open

their data pools to developers by 2025.

**Harmonization and Regulations in Socioeconomic Structure**

The identification of new legal and ethical problems that arise with the spread of AI
technologies in social and economic life, and the creation of new legislation and norms to solve
such problems have an important place in the AI works of many countries and international
organizations.

The United Nations (UN) brings together its work around human-centered and responsible AI
concepts and highlights the contribution of AI applications to achieving sustainable development
goals. For example, the UN Interregional Crime and Justice Research Institute launched a program
on AI and robotics in 2015 to examine the effects of AI technologies on studies related to their
field. In the same year, the UN General Assembly held an event named “Rising to the Challenges
of International Security and the Emergence of Artificial Intelligence”. At the meetings initiated
as a result of the work of the Experts Group, emerging problem areas between civilian principles
and military requirements and different perspectives between countries were brought to the
agenda within the scope of Lethal Autonomous Weapon Systems. On the other hand, activities
on data privacy, data protection and data ethics are carried out within the UN special consultant
expert group and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).
The “AI for Good” initiative, launched by ITU in 2017, aims to establish a common understanding
to identify the capabilities of AI technologies, develop technical standards and provide political
guidance in this field. This structure is an impartial platform where governments, the private
sector, and academia can come together and carry out various works in cooperation with relevant
institutions.[22]

The EU carries out efforts to establish an ethical/legal framework for the development of
“human-centric and trustworthy AI” so that more data on the public sector can be prepared
and made available for use. In this context, the AI High Level Expert Group (AI HLEG), which
leads the works carried out in the EU, has published the _Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI_
_and Assessment List for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (ALTAI). This guide document defines_
fundamental rights and ethical values, which are important for the development of AI technology
and applications, especially the transparency, accountability, and protection of personal data
privacy. According to the definition, trustworthy AI has three components, which should be met
throughout the system's entire lifecycle:[23]

1. It should be lawful, complying with all applicable laws and regulations.

2. It should be ethical, ensuring adherence to ethical principles and values.

3. It should be robust, both from a technical and social perspective since, even with
good intentions, AI systems can cause unintentional harm.

On the other hand, the European Parliament published a draft report in 2016 containing
recommendations on civil law rules regarding robotics. The report mentions the general
and ethical principles that audit and regulate the use of civil robotics and the progress of AI
technologies for future AI-powered robotic systems and places particular emphasis on personal
responsibility for robotics protocols and smart and autonomous devices.[24]

In 2018, the EU Declaration on Artificial Intelligence was signed by the EU member states.[25 ]

This declaration sets a roadmap in AI for the member states and the objectives that would enable
EU countries to compete with the leading countries in AI. The declaration addresses concerns


-----

such as the integration of AI into the economy, how it will be positioned in the fields of science
and education, and AI ethics, which are seen at the center of technological change, and a call
for cooperation was made to the member states on these issues. The declaration also discusses
fundamental rights and values, especially transparency, accountability and ensuring the privacy
of personal data, which are considered as a priority in all EU countries. In addition, it is also aimed
to increase the accountability of the systems by contributing to the sustainability and reliability
of AI systems. Although AI-powered decision-making processes can produce successful, fast and
low-cost solutions with the European Approach to Excellence and Trust in Artificial Intelligence
_Prospectus published in 2020; it is also pointed out that such processes may pose risks such_
as low explainability, intrusion in private lives that may cause gender-based or other kinds
of discrimination, and being used for criminal purposes. In order to minimize these risks, the
document recommends adopting regulatory approaches for the development and use of AI
systems.[26 ]The European Commission has published the draft legal regulation for AI, which is the
first in this context.

At the international level, the process of standardization on trustworthy AI has also begun.
ISO is carrying out efforts, and in this context, the “SC 42” subcommittee was established in 2017
and the ISO/IEC TR 24028:2020 standard for trustworthy AI was published in 2020.

Autonomous vehicles are expected to be one of the AI-powered systems that are projected
to cause significant changes in the socioeconomic structure. In the autonomous vehicle market,
products are classified according to the level of autonomy. While it is expected that the highest
level vehicles, which are aimed to offer the steering-less driving experience as fully autonomous
at all times, will be developed in the next 10 years, it is evaluated that their adoption by society
will not occur as rapidly.[27] The most important obstacles to the development of the market are
considered to be customer concerns arising from issues such as cost, current regulations and
cyber attacks. According to a global survey conducted in 2019, Turkish drivers rank the first as
being the most interested in autonomous vehicles with a ratio of 67%. Our country is followed
by Germany (54%), United Kingdom (48%) and, USA (47%). On the other hand, although the
skepticism towards the safety of autonomous vehicles has decreased in recent years, it remains
around 36%. It is seen that skepticism in China, France, and Türkiye is lower than in other
developed economies.[28]

In almost all national AI strategies, it is emphasized that the first step to be taken for the
widespread and safe use of AI-based systems is the development of ethical principles. From this
point of view, there are countries that continue to work towards becoming a “global thought
leader”, including the ethical dimension of AI. China, the United Kingdom, and especially Canada
have declared that they aim to lead international works in the field. China has made it clear that it
wants to govern the formation of laws, regulations, and ethical norms regarding AI. The Montreal
_Declaration for the Responsible Development of Artificial Intelligence, published by Canada in_
2018, is an internationally recognized work in this field.

**International Cooperation**

The need to develop international cooperation in the development of innovation and
entrepreneurship in AI, improving digital infrastructures, generalizing open source libraries, and
determining framework rules for privacy and ethical principles is an issue emphasized in AIrelated policies and strategies of international organizations and many countries.

The EU has added the Digital Europe Programme to the multi-annual financial framework
programs it has developed for the 2021-2027 period to improve skills capacity and infrastructure
in critical technology areas. The following basic strategies have been put forward for AI, which is
one of the 5 main objectives of the program:

-  Keeping AI centers in Europe in touch with each other and improving the capacity
of AI centers,

-  Creating platforms that will facilitate access to AI resources,

-  To support the development of AI applications in critical industries.

The Coordinated Plan on Artificial Intelligence[29] published by the European Commission in
December 2018 emphasizes the necessity of establishing cooperation for the modernization of
the education systems of the member states within the scope of the Digital Europe Program. In
addition, the importance of cooperation between EU member states and non-member states
is underlined for the creation of EU-wide common data spaces and AI open platforms, ensuring
interoperability and actions that will appeal to the sector.

The emphasis on data governance and human-centric AI studies has been emphasized at
the G20 summits held in recent years. Our President underlined that AI should be handled with
a human-centric approach at the summit he attended in Japan in 2019. In the same year, an
international initiative on data flows called “Osaka Track” was launched under the leadership
of Japan. The aim of this initiative is to develop a framework for the “Data Free Flow with Trust”
concept. In this context, a multidimensional architecture is proposed to develop international
cooperation on data flows between countries. The document explaining the aforementioned
concept draws attention to the importance of data security and the fact that countries adopting
disproportionate restrictions on cross-border data flows may cause irreparable losses in terms of
the citizen welfare and competitiveness of countries.[30]

The “OECD Artificial Intelligence Experts Network (OECD ONE AI)” was established in order
to facilitate international cooperation between AI-focused initiatives and organizations and to
exchange information between experts in different geographies. Being an interdisciplinary and
multi-stakeholder structure, OECD ONE AI brings together AI expertise from various disciplines,
such as AI researchers, computer scientists, engineers and other technical experts. This platform
also contains experts on social sciences, humanities, legal and ethical issues; as well as experts
from national governments.

The OECD Council Recommendation on Artificial Intelligence, to which our country is also
a party, was adopted on 22 May 2019 in order to strengthen the global AI policy ecosystem
that respects human rights, democratic and ethical values.[1] These principles, supported by the
EU, were soon adopted by the G20 as well. The document also provides recommendations for
international cooperation on trustworthy AI.


-----

In 2020, the “Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence (GPAI)” was launched under the
leadership of Canada and France and with the support of the OECD. The OECD acts as the
secretariat of GPAI, which is the first international initiative on AI to which countries are a party.
This international initiative encourages participating countries to conduct research and develop
practices in line with the principles of “responsible AI” based on human rights, inclusion, and
diversity.

On the other hand, AI applications have provided important gains in the international
fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, which has created a social and economic emergency by
affecting the world in 2020 and has brought new risk factors to the agenda. The works of the
European Commission[31] and OECD[32] on the subject have especially focused on health data and
related technologies. Regarding the use of AI technologies in the fight against the pandemic, the
following findings were revealed in these works:

-  AI-powered systems need more datasets, tools, and resources that are shared quickly
and reliably in extraordinary situations such as pandemics. AI-powered monitoring
tools that allow research without compromising privacy should be developed and
utilized. Therefore, there is an important need to establish multidisciplinary and
open science-based international cooperation to enable potential research and
development efforts.

-  AI has been implemented in various areas of epidemiological research modeling,
such as estimating the number of cases for different public policy options, making
predictions about the course of the pandemic. It can also help investigate the
scale and spread of the “infodemia” to address misinformation and disinformation,
including the emergence of hate speech.

**Structural and Workforce Transformation**

The use of AI technologies is important in terms of creating high value-added products
and services both in the private sector and the public sector. Utilizing this potential requires
the relevant actors to invest in their technological infrastructure and employees, and to improve
their business processes and decision mechanisms with a data-driven approach.

There are certain challenges to expanding the application areas of AI all over the world. The
top challenges to adopting AI are listed as a lack of skills (56%), understanding AI use cases (42%),
and concerns with data quality (34%).[33]

The WEF has developed and piloted common tools for governments to deliver AI solutions
built with ethical principles in mind. The AI Procurement Toolkit for the Public and Private Sector
prepared for this purpose includes concrete recommendations on purchasing, risk assessments,
proposal drafting and evaluation.[34] In addition, a toolkit for recruitment, performance evaluation
and promotion is being developed with the contribution of public institutions and private sector
organizations in our country in order to base the use of AI applications in human resources on
human-centric and ethical values.

In its report, the International Labour Organization (ILO) draws attention to the disruptive
effects of the development of AI technologies on the labor market, as well as the inequalities that
may arise in employment with the benefits of technological advances. By touching on issues


-----

such as the forms of regulating the digital economy and appropriate data sharing methods, the
opportunities and risks that will arise with the spread of AI in working life are pointed out.[35] In
addition, the Work for a Brighter Future Report was prepared, which includes recommendations
for the future of working life that is affected by different factors, especially digital transformation.[36]
The _ILO Centenary Declaration for the Future of Work was adopted at the ILO Centenary_
Conference held in 2019. The declaration recommends creating a human-centric agenda for all
stakeholders and, in this direction, investing in the skills of employees, institutions related to
working life, and decent and sustainable jobs.[37]

On the other hand, there are different projections for the industries involved in the
transformation of the workforce. As can be seen in Figure 8, the automotive and assembly,
and telecommunication industries are expected to adopt AI technologies relatively faster, thus
the largest workforce cuts and transformations in the next three years are expected in these
industries. The research points out that the infrastructure, professional services, and high-tech
sectors are more likely to expand their workforces through the adoption of AI.[11]

**Figure 8. Predicted Workforce Changes Due to AI Adoption in Sectors Worldwide, 2020-2023[11 ]**

In general, it is seen that there is a significant transformation in the core skill needs that
constitute the foundation of professional duties. Figure 9 shows projections for how core skill
needs will change from 2016 to 2030 for the US and Western European countries. It is estimated
that while the need for physical and basic cognitive skills will decrease, the need for social and
emotional skills and technological skills will increase and total working hours will increase by
more than 25%.[38]

**Figure 9. Change of Skills Demand in the Workforce for the US and Western Europe, 2016-2030[38 ]**

According to the WEF, over the next five years, half of all workers will need to upskill or reskill
to prepare for changing and new jobs. On the other hand, digitalization of business processes
(84%) and remote working (83%) are among the priority actions of organizations for human
resources during the post-COVID-19 economic recovery period. They are followed by the process
automation (50%) and the digitization of vocational skills training (42%).[39]

Regarding the need for the skill sets required by digitalization in Europe, according to Figure
10, it can be said that the demand for competencies related to AI and data analytics, especially in
the manufacturing industry and wholesale, retail, and transportation industries, will be high. As for
the public sector, it is seen that AI domain skills will be of high priority, along with organizational
architecture and organizational applications.[40]

On a country basis, the USA and China focus on the structural transformation of the private
sector and world leadership with their global scale companies and a broad-based approach. In its
AI strategy, China has emphasized that becoming a world leader in AI is possible by “establishing
an open and collaborative AI technology innovation system”.

While the transitivity between industry and science has increased in the United States over
the last decade, attempts to achieve this transitivity in Europe have been very limited. The EU has
strategically adopted positioning itself as a “regulatory actor” in digital technologies, especially in
AI, in order to reduce the gap. With a population of approximately 400 million, Europe is one of
the most developed markets targeted by technology companies. Through this approach, namely
the “Brussels Effect”, Europe aims to both protect its market and consumers and to penetrate
the markets of other countries by providing technology and product/service development with
the standards it sets.

Many countries, especially Germany, attach great importance to the economic growth that
will be brought on by AI, and in this context, steps are taken towards sectoral awareness and
workforce transformation. Germany has declared that it wants to be a “seal of quality” in the
development of AI technologies and aims to be a center of excellence in line with its industrial
capacity.

France, on the other hand, aims for the EU to be an alternative to the USA and China in AI, led
by France with its vision of “AI for Humanity”.

Russia and Israel put a strong emphasis on the implementation of autonomous systems in
the defense industry.

The UK aims to raise funds with its industry target and thus to increase AI capabilities and
has signed an agreement with the private sector for this purpose.

Japan uses the technology primarily to deal with the problems of its aging population. In line
with this economic target they have set, they have taken the steps to meet the requirements
needed by the private sector.

Estonia is developing the KrattAI platform, via which it creates a network of interoperable AI
applications to provide public services with voice assistant support.

Finland has published an awareness training set for the fundamentals of AI, namely “Elements
of AI”, which is accessible by everyone and available online. Targeted to reach 1% of the Finnish
population, the application has already reached more than 500,000 users globally.

**AI High-Level Policy, Legislation and**

**Institutions in Türkiye**

The Eleventh Development Plan contains an evaluation of the horizontal technology areas
needed to ensure technological progress in determined priority sectors and development
areas and technology trends in the world. In the Plan, AI was regarded among the determined
critical technology areas such as the Internet of Things, augmented reality, big data, and sensor
technologies. In addition, the Plan includes policies and measures for the development of
domestic production capabilities in those technology areas, the use of these technologies in
priority sectors to increase productivity, the transformation of the workforce so that they can
work effectively with these technologies, and the use of these technologies for improving public
services.

The Eleventh Development Plan Specialized Commission (SC) Reports also provide
important evaluations addressing the needs and priorities of our country for its socioeconomic
development in the face of the rapid development and disruptive effects of technology. For
example, in the R&D and Innovation Ecosystem Strengthening SC Report; the necessity to “make
_legislative changes that will allow the data in the hands of the government to be shared with_
_the entrepreneurs who are developing products so that they have access to the data needed by_
_big data and artificial intelligence applications” is emphasized. In the Labor Market and Youth_
Employment SC Report, it is pointed out that “policies should be prioritized for areas brought on
_by digitalization such as artificial intelligence, big data and the Internet of Things”._

“AI and machine learning” and “big data and data analytics” were prioritized as the top two
areas with the highest impact and feasibility in terms of economic impact, social benefit and
national security among the 27 areas of technology that were determined by STIPC as part of
the “Identification of Priority Technology Areas to Focus on within the Scope of Groundbreaking
Strategic Approach”.

STIPC is currently preparing the “Artificial Intelligence Technology Roadmap”. The Artificial
Intelligence Technology Roadmap includes the strategic targets to be determined in terms
of AI-related technologies, the products and technologies that are critical to be developed for
our country to achieve these targets, R&D projects for their development, and priority sectoral
applications of the critical products/technologies developed.

In order to establish a long-term roadmap for AI, which is determined as the priority
technology area in various national policy documents, the DTO and MoIT were appointed the task
of preparing the “National Artificial Intelligence Strategy” with Measure 473.1 of the Presidential
Annual Program for 2021 prepared in line with the Eleventh Development Plan.

Various issues directly or indirectly related to the development and application of AI
technologies are also included in the following sectoral/thematic strategy documents:

-  2023 Industry and Technology Strategy

_accelerate development in multiple sectors, and ensuring the implementation of the determined_
_policies and strategies, supporting R&D and investment activities and initiatives in related fields,_
_making regulations and inspections regarding related fields and supports” was added among_
_the duties of the MoIT. The General Directorate of National Technology (GDNT) was established_
within the MoIT in order to establish the necessary institutional capacity for the activities to be
carried out within this framework.

GDNT is responsible for carrying out activities in new technology areas to ensure capacity
development and economic value generation on a national scale. The Decree appoints GDNT with
tasks such as taking measures for the growth of the ecosystem for transformative technologies,
especially big data and AI, supporting the development of businesses, increasing domestic and


-----

national production capacity, and contributing to the training of researchers, within the scope of
the National Technology Move; and in this direction, carrying out programs and projects with high
impact at the country.

**TÜBİTAK Artificial Intelligence Institute**

Aiming to become a catalyst in the spread of AI technologies, TÜBİTAK Artificial Intelligence
Institute was established in 2020, building on a new cooperation model that strongly interacts
with the ecosystem and brings together different levels of competence. The Institute is the first
to be established with a direct focus on a promising technology field that cuts horizontally across
sectors and research fields. The main goals of the TÜBİTAK Artificial Intelligence Institute are as
follows:

-  Ensuring the emergence of products that provide pioneering, inclusive and
sustainable solutions that meet the needs of our country and global trends, via the
AI technologies to be developed,

-  Training AI researchers,

-  Playing an active role in the development of the start-up ecosystem in AI technologies.

It is foreseen that the cooperation on the basis of focal areas with stakeholders in the
ecosystem will be managed holistically at the program level. The aim is to work with research
units in different disciplines in a way that will serve the concept of a “system of systems”.

**Other Institutions and Organizations**

Institutional structures related to AI have been established at the level of ministries in our
country as well. For example;

-  “Section of Big Data and Artificial Intelligence” under the Directorate General for
Information Technologies within the Ministry of Justice,

-  “Artificial Intelligence and Wearable Technologies Unit” under the National Projects
Management Coordinator under the General Directorate of Health Information
Systems within the Ministry of Health,

-  “Section of Process Management and Artificial Intelligence” under the Department
of Communications and Information Systems under the Ministry of National
Defense was established.

There are also institutional structures at the level of local governments. For example, “Section
of Artificial Intelligence Education and Research” was established within Gaziantep Metropolitan
Municipality. The section's objective is to organize activities and training aimed at raising awareness
of citizens in this field.

Established under the Directorate of Turkish Health Institutes, the “Turkish Institute of Health
Data Research and Artificial Intelligence” aims to carry out projects on the subjects of saving
money by preventing unnecessary examinations, providing fast reporting and diagnosis.

**Current Situation of Türkiye in the Framework of**
**Strategic Priority Areas**

**AI Experts and Employment in the Domain**

As of 2020, the total employment of the Information and Communication Technologies (ICT)
sector is around 260,000 people, of which 120,000 are professionals in ICT. On the other hand,
approximately 10,000 people are employed in IT in public institutions and organizations, including
central and local governments. In general, there is an employment of approximately 480,000
people when ICT-related occupations in all sectors are considered.[iii] Although it is considered that
the AI employment situation is developing rapidly in terms of quantity and quality, reliable data
on field-specific employment cannot be obtained due to the lack of occupational classifications
in the field. The educational backgrounds of those working in AI for application development
may be computer engineering, electronics, software, and mechatronics engineering, as well
as mathematics, statistics, and physics. In addition, it is seen that specializations in different
professions and disciplines such as AI engineering, robot training, data detective; and law,
sociology, ethics, and economics have developed in line with the needs emerging in AI. This
uncertainty in terms of the size of employment in AI is not unique to our country, but activities to
obtain more reliable data regarding this field continue at the international level.

Our country is taking important steps in increasing the expertise and employment in AI,
advanced digital skills, and information and communication technologies in general:

-  AI was determined as a priority area within the scope of the 100/2000 Council of
Higher Education (CoHE) PhD Project. Within the framework of the project where
interdisciplinary work is prioritized, the employment of research assistants and
lecturers in AI is set to increase in the coming periods.

-  The “1 Million Employees” project, initiated under the coordination of the Ministry
of Treasury and Finance, is among the most comprehensive initiatives carried out
in the field of IT in general. The project aims to train 1 million citizens by 2023 and
provides free online training opportunities, including AI, via the integration of the
BTK Academy training platform and creates a pool of resumes for employers.

-  As part of the 2023 Industry and Technology Strategy, the “Türkiye Open Source
Platform” was established in order to train 500,000 software developers, to help
these talents achieve worldwide success, and to produce software-based products
on an international scale in our country. Among the works of the platform are two
qualified software developer schools using a learning model for learning from each
other and open source software projects, especially on natural language processing.
Also, the National Technology Academy is established under the responsibility of
the MoIT in order to contribute to the realization of the goals set regarding human
capital. The Academy will offer programs to train qualified human resources with
special expertise needed in new technology fields. Within the scope of these
programs, special expertise definitions will be made especially in the areas of use
where AI technology is prominent, and it will be ensured that the ecosystem is
equipped with critical competencies.

iii Private sector employment data is produced by TurkStat within the scope of Household Labor Force Statistics on the basis of
ISCO-08 classification (25, 35, 1330, 2152, 2153, 2166, 2356, 2434, 7422, 4132, 8212). The results for the public sector are obtained
based on different databases. Excludes academics and military personnel. The ICT Sector is evaluated on the basis of the
NACE Rev. 2 classification (26.1-26.4, 26.8, 46.5, 58.2, 61, 62, 63, 95.1).


-----

-  Within the scope of the Uni-Data Project conducted by the Presidency of the
Human Resources Office of the Presidency of the Republic of Türkiye in order to
increase the overlap between the educated workforce and employment, it is aimed
to evaluate the performance of undergraduate program graduates in the labor
market on a departmental basis. The Education Workforce Research conducted by
the Turkish Statistical Institute (TurkStat), which deals with the scope of the project
in more detail, aims to shed light on the relationship between education and career
development at the undergraduate level.

-  Since generally accepted common criteria for determining skill and qualification
requirements on the basis of AI occupations do not exist yet, information available
on job posting sites and professional networks is the source for determining
professional competence. With a project carried out by TurkStat in collaboration
with TÜBİTAK B3Lab and aiming to analyze online job postings using big data
methods, it is aimed to make analyzes to better understand employment supply
and demand in the context of AI competency needs.

-  Similarly, with the “Project for Removing the Vocational Skills Inventory and
Improving the Matching Services on the Basis of Skills”, which is expected to be
completed by the end of 2022 under the responsibility of the Turkish Employment
Agency, it is aimed to outline the current occupational distribution of the general
skill and qualification maps of our country. In this way, skills and qualifications will
be evaluated as trends over time, and effective market matching will be achieved
with the determination of future skills, qualifications, and occupations.

-  Our universities are trying to adapt to the transformative effects of digital
transformation through updated curriculums. In this context, undergraduate
programs in the field of AI were opened in 4 universities, the first of which was
launched in 2018. In addition, in order to enable specialization in the field, 14 masters
and 1 doctorate programs in AI, as well as 24 master's and 5 doctorate programs
in big data, robotics, and smart systems were launched. The number of research
centers in relevant fields is also on the rise. 13 centers focused on AI and 20 centers
focused on big data, robotics and smart systems have been established already.

A significant number of AI studies are also carried out in Türkiye. There are 1,218 academics
working in the field.[iv ]Figure 13 shows that the total number of international indexed publications
from Türkiye was 9,409 between 2009 and 2018.[41] Türkiye ranks 16th in the world according to the
number of AI publications. However, these publications are not sufficiently reflected in industrial
applications as patents and products.

iv  It includes academics who work in artificial intelligence, computer vision or machine learning.

Competency performances of universities are evaluated in comparison with each other in
the TÜBİTAK study titled _Field-Based Competency Analysis of Universities.[42] AI competence_
analysis of our universities is presented in Figure 15. Türkiye ranks 16th in the world according to
the number of AI publications. The number of graduate students in the prominent universities
of the top-ranking countries is higher than the number of undergraduate students. However, it
is noteworthy that this rate is around 30-35% in universities in Türkiye.


**Figure 15. AI Competence Analysis of Universities in Türkiye[42]**


-----

With the increasing interest in AI studies, many awareness and certified training programs

and workshops for university students and the pre-higher education population are being

implemented under the cooperation of academia, NGOs, the private sector, and public institutions.

Prize competitions are organized as well. For example, the General Directorate of Vocational and

Technical Education under the Ministry of National Education (MoNE) has been organizing robot

competitions since 2007. In TEKNOFEST Aviation, Space and Technology Festival, which has

been held since 2018, technology competitions are organized on subjects such as unmanned

vehicles, natural language processing and intelligent transportation across different age groups.

In addition, the “AI Education and Awareness Project” was initiated under the leadership of

TOBB and TOBB Economy and Technology University, in which cooperation between NGOs and

academia and the private sector is of particular importance. Within the scope of this project, it is

planned to provide training for vocational high school students and teachers, university students

and academicians, employees and companies, to a total of 50,000 people.

Although the above-mentioned activities have benefits especially in raising awareness,

there is a need for a radical transformation in both higher education and pre-higher education

model and curriculum in order to increase the quality in the field. In this direction, MoNE and

CoHE are taking important steps together with their stakeholders. The MoNE published the

document “2023 Education Vision for a Strong Future” and started to restructure the education

system in this direction. CoHE, on the other hand, has started the process of determining the

“Future Professions” roadmap, and within this scope, they have held workshops with high-level

representatives of the academy and business world.

Equipping talented young people with basic competencies before higher education is also

an important issue in order to expand the pool of expert human resources in AI. In this context,

the “Deneyap Türkiye” project, which supports next generation learning skills, was initiated under

the coordination of the MoIT. One of the most fruitful areas of the three-year training program in

Deneyap Türkiye technology workshops in 81 provinces is AI. The project aims to equip 50,000

talented students with basic level AI competencies in five years.

On the other hand, the AI Education Project carried out by the General Directorate of

Innovation and Educational Technologies of the MoNE aims to create an online AI education

platform, train teachers and students in the field, and integrate AI education and AI coding, which

is a basic skill for the future, into relevant education plans and practices. The project started in

September 2019 and is planned to be completed in 2021. The book titled “Artificial Intelligence

Education for Children” is among the outputs of the project. In addition, teachers were trained for

AI education, and AI education videos were prepared to support these trainings.

Considering the current situation of our country, in order to train AI domain experts, increase

employment and improve policy making capacity in these matters, first of all, it is necessary to

determine professional definitions and qualifications for the field and to create an inventory of

experts and researchers working in the field. In addition, launching postgraduate programs in

the field, training academicians who can teach in these programs and encouraging students to

participate in them are other important issues. On the other hand, another necessity is to equip

talented young people with basic competencies to specialize in AI before higher education. In

this context, subject-oriented next-generation education capabilities should be improved.


-----

**Research, Entrepreneurship and Innovation**

TÜBİTAK, the leading institution for the management and financing of research in Türkiye,
funds a large number of AI R&D projects. TÜBİTAK has provided a total of TRY 1.7 billion (at
2020 prices) to approximately 1,715 R&D and innovation projects carried out in the last 10 years.
Figure 16 shows that approximately 25% of this funding is the support provided to the academy,
while nearly 75% is the R&D support provided to the private sector for the development of the
industry. 41.2% of the support for AI R&D projects was given to large enterprises, 31.6% to SMEs,
and 2.3% to technology-based individual entrepreneurs for mentoring and seed capital purposes.
Regulations have been made for SMEs and individual entrepreneurs to benefit more from the
R&D support given to the industry.

Large Enterprises Academic Supports
41,2% 24,8%

Individual Entrepreneurs SME
2,3% 31,6%

**Figure 16. Distribution of TÜBİTAK AI Funds and Grants, 2009-2019**

An analysis of the support provided by TÜBİTAK to the private sector over 1,290 AI projects
in the January 2007-March 2020 period shows that the number of projects supported in the
field of “digital transformation of the industry and advanced manufacturing systems” and the
allocated support budget is higher than other areas of use, which is shown in Table 2. AI projects
in this area account for 18% of the total funded AI project budget. The following fields are “digital
transformation in commerce” and “smart life and health”. As for the field of social sciences, it is
noteworthy to point out that fund allocated for AI is low.

Private Sector in AI, 2007-March 2020

Companies that operate in TDZs and have R&D centers also make significant contributions
to AI works. While the majority of these companies are operating in the fields of “Software”,
“Defense and Security” and “Machinery”, the most active subjects in AI R&D and application are
“Machine Learning”, “Foresight and Data Analytics” and “Computer Vision”. The AI fields in which
TDZ companies and companies with R&D centers plan to carry out R&D studies in the future and
the AI fields in which they are currently carrying out R&D studies are similar. While 56% of these
companies have competent personnel working in AI, 30% have experts who have a master's or
doctoral thesis in AI. In addition, 35% of companies state that they have or have access to data
that they can use for AI domain. While 45% of TDZs and/or companies with R&D centers involved
in AI are funded by TÜBİTAK and 7% are funded by KOSGEB, 14% finance their activities with their
own capital.

There are also different programs carried out under the cooperation of public institutions
and organizations, the private sector and universities. One of such programs is the AI JET BIGG
Acceleration Program, which was initiated in cooperation with HAVELSAN Yıldız Innovation
Center, TÜBİTAK and Hacettepe Teknokent Technology Transfer Center. On the other hand, AI
applications stand out in online project competitions such as “Coronathon Türkiye”, “Hack the
Crisis Türkiye” and “TR-Covid19 Joint Mind Platform” organized by civil initiatives as a part of the
fight against COVID-19 in 2020.

An analysis of start-up networks in terms of AI has shown that there are 205 AI start-ups based
in Türkiye. 11% of these focus on virtual assistants, while another 11% focus on image processing.
Approximately 50% of the start-ups are located in technoparks and 73% are located in Istanbul.[43]

Large-scale companies dominate AI investments with their internal investments. The most
important sources of funding for new initiatives in the sector are venture capital and private


-----

equity. The most funded fields are machine learning and computer vision. They are followed by
natural language processing, autonomous vehicles and robotics. Companies are exploring new
areas for the development and application of AI methods to solve customer-oriented use cases.
Smart game systems, virtual assistants, smart city platforms are other examples of these areas
developed through open source AI platforms.

In line with the aim of increasing value-added production in Türkiye, the “Technology Oriented
Industry Initiative Program” was launched by the MoIT in order to concentrate on the funding
and incentives and incentives provided by the ministry and its affiliated/related institutions to
medium-high and high-technology sectors by managing them from a single point. An end-toend design is planned by adding the incentive mechanisms of the relevant ministries to the
program. The effectiveness of incentive mechanisms and the additional opportunities they will
create can be improved using AI technologies. One of the main objectives of the program is to
shift from core technology (in the laboratory) to a system (market) of products/services/systems,
particularly in priority areas, provided that investments and incentives are competitive, flexible,
and equally accessible to all.

With the “Innovative Software Competition” (Yenilikçi Yazılımlar Yarışıyor - Y3) program
organized by the Presidency of Defense Industries, it is aimed to increase performance by
competitiveness, work on innovative methods, steer the sector and create a competency
repository in certain software development areas that are critical for defense needs, especially AI.

In order to develop innovative AI technologies and to increase their technology readiness,
the “TÜBİTAK Artificial Intelligence Institute” was established to host the necessary activities and
act as a catalyst, and efforts are underway for its structuring. It is aimed that the institute will
develop start-up networks, use common infrastructures for joint development, and become an
important center for advanced research. The basis of the institute's governance model is bringing
its stakeholders together for research and development with an open innovation approach and
ensuring pre-competitive cooperation.

Considering the situation in our country, it is one of the important requirements to increase
public funds for activities in this field in terms of improving research, entrepreneurship, and
innovation. In addition, measures should be taken to improve the number and quality of
businesses operating in the field, which are the most important sources of innovation in AI. It is
also important to ensure that venture capital funds, which are an important source of funding for
technological start-ups, make investments in AI in our country. In addition to these, the creation
of clusters that can provide synergy by bringing companies working in AI together will also be
beneficial in terms of increasing the maturity of the AI ecosystem.

**Technical Infrastructure, Platforms and Data**

Defining the data access and sharing framework between institutions in order to develop
the basic information systems needed for digital transformation on a national scale and common
infrastructure, services and standards, and establishing or developing the tools to be used in
the pre-processes necessary for the use of the said data in AI research are important in terms of
strengthening the national AI ecosystem.

In order to develop inter-institutional cooperation and to create effective decision-making
processes based on data in the public sector, DTO is working on creating the National Data


-----

Dictionary (NDD), which will include standards and definitions for the data used by the public
institutions in all applications, platforms and infrastructure layers. By determining data ownership/
responsibility with the NDD, it is aimed to manage institutional memory independently of
individuals and to minimize inter-institutional integration problems. With the implementation
of the NDD;

-  A common language will be established across public institutions,

-  The national data inventory will be prepared,

-  Data will be standardized and made singular,

-  Data ownership/responsibility will be determined.

The DTO efforts regarding the NDD include the following:

-  “Data Dictionary Creation Methodology” document was prepared.

-  Mentor training was given to relevant personnel in all public institutions and
affiliated and related institutions.

-  The NDD system software infrastructure is operational and can be accessed at
“https://uvs.gov.tr”.

-  NDD Helpdesk was established within the DTO to solve the problems that may be
encountered during the creation of data dictionaries.

-  Data dictionary creation activities carried out in all public institutions and affiliated
and related institutions are monitored.

With the “Open Government Data Portal”, another project of the DTO, the data generated
by public institutions and organizations while performing their functions will be shared publicly
within the framework of the principles of protecting intellectual property rights, privacy and
national security. In this framework, “veri.gov.tr”, the national open government data portal, was
designed in accordance with international examples using open source software infrastructure.
The data that can be published on the portal were collected from institutions, anonymization
and data cleaning studies were carried out and transferred to the test environment. “Open
Government Data Circular Draft” was prepared to establish the legal infrastructure. It is expected
that the portal will strengthen communication between stakeholders sharing and using open
government data, encouraging collaborations in this context and triggering new studies to
create value from data.

With the Data Labeling Platform (Data Hive), implemented by the Presidency of Defense
Industries, a platform is being developed that will enable browser-based labeling of video, image
and text data, which will then be used to collect labeled datasets for projects carried out primarily
within the institution and to be realized thereafter. The project ensures that the training and test
data such as text, image, video, sound and 3D point cloud, which are essential for the development
of AI algorithms, can be crowdsourced and the labeled data are centralized.

In our country, important steps are taken in terms of investment in AI-related technologies.
Various AI-related research infrastructure projects are supported through Public Investment


-----

Programs. In this context, an important reference for high performance computing is the “Turkish
National Science e-Infrastructure” project within the body of TÜBİTAK National Academic Network
and Information Center (ULAKBİM). Thanks to the investments in the center, an effective and
interactive computer network focused on current technologies is established and operated at
the national level. Similarly, “Neuroscience and Neurotechnology Center of Excellence” project
within ITU, “Robotic Technologies Research, Development and Training Center” project within
METU, “Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Laboratories” project within Boğaziçi University, and
the “Neuroscience and Neurotechnology Center of Excellence” project, carried out in partnership
with Ankara University, Gazi University and METU, is included in the 2021 Investment Program and
these projects continue to be supported. Thanks to the aforementioned projects, which directly
and indirectly contribute to the development of AI technologies, research that will enable related
studies to be conducted between universities and other research laboratories is generalized and
raised to international standards.

Our country joined the EuroHPC Joint Undertaking for high performance computing
activities in April 2019. In this context, our country made a joint application to the “Precursors
to Exascale” call with Spain, Portugal and Croatia, and with the accepted joint proposal, Türkiye
gained direct access to the supercomputer named “MareNostrum 5”. This infrastructure is being
established in Barcelona and will be one of the few supercomputers in the world with a capacity
of more than 150 Petaflops once it becomes operational in the middle of 2021.

Within the scope of a project carried out on the Türkiye Open Source Platform, text and
audio datasets and open source algorithm libraries are being prepared on which researchers and
entrepreneurs will be able to work and develop applications. It is aimed to launch products and
brands in the field with the support of public institutions and global companies.

It is important to plan investments in AI technology in cooperation with the public and private
sectors, in line with national opportunities for constantly developing hardware and software
infrastructures, and to ensure the joint use of infrastructure investments by the ecosystem. In this
framework, it is necessary to nurture the AI ecosystem through an interoperable infrastructure
by creating multi-stakeholder interactions through a platform approach.

**Harmonization and Regulations in Socioeconomic Structure**

It is necessary to foresee possible social and economic problems that are expected to arise
due to the widespread use of AI systems and to determine the measures to be taken against
them within the framework of ethical and legal principles. In this context, adopting the approach
that AI will be a tool for the welfare of humanity necessitates a review of the legal regulations in
the relevant fields.

With the spread of AI applications, legal regulations that directly concern individual rights
and freedoms should be made in a way that sets an example to the universal legal system as
well. In this context, the _Law in the Age of Artificial Intelligence Report, which focuses on the_
relationship between the law and AI in Türkiye, was published in 2019. The report mainly focuses
on four issues:[44]

-  Recommendations are made about the requirements for the adaptation of law
schools to technology, and the need to increase the number of qualified experts in the
field is emphasized.


-----

-  It is emphasized the necessity of increasing technological competency in attorneyship.

-  It focuses on AI technologies and the concepts of legal and criminal liability.

-  Besides working on legal regulations and practices, evaluations are made about
the importance and requirements of ensuring compliance in the EU harmonization
process, and it is pointed out that the relevant regulations in Türkiye should be made
quickly.

Among other efforts carried out in order to identify the needs to accelerate the adaptation
of the socioeconomic structure to AI in our country is the workshop held in 2017 by the Türkiye
Artificial Intelligence Initiative. According to the results of the workshop, the most important
needs in our country in this regard are raising awareness, creating an AI ecosystem that will
support communication and collaboration, accelerating the commercialization cycle through the
private sector and public institution projects to be supported by intellectual property regulations,
competence programs, technical infrastructure, innovation competitions and field examples.[45]

It is considered that problems such as prejudice and biased choices, which vary depending
on the country but nonetheless occur all over the world, may constitute an important obstacle
in the way of obtaining social benefits through AI. In this context, the “Workshop on Prejudice in
Artificial Intelligence Applications” was held by the Türkiye Informatics Foundation Starting Node
Platform in 2019. Based on the results of the workshop, it is possible to classify the prejudices
specifically for our country under the headings of education, health, regulation, information and
security.[46]

The preparation of an ethical framework that emphasizes data security and encourages
the protection of privacy is very important to ensure the public's trust in AI. With this sensitivity
in mind, the DTO has initiated the efforts to establish a National Data Governance and Privacy
Working Group with the aim of bringing together experts working on the legal and technological
sides of data privacy in our country and providing these experts a place where they can cooperate
with relevant institutions. This working group is aimed to coordinate the relevant institutions
and organizations in order to create the policy and guidance documents needed in the national
context, establish a consultation mechanism for international activities, bring together experts
working on the technical and legal side and provide a ground for cooperation.

The prerequisite for AI applications to find widespread use is to ensure that all stakeholders
trust these technologies. In this context, considering the current situation of our country, it is
necessary to raise awareness in society of the effects and possible risks of AI technologies on
social life and to establish governance mechanisms that can confirm the compliance of these
practices with ethical values. In addition, the legal infrastructure needs to be updated to allow
AI applications to be tested and improved in various scenarios. Finally, the data governance
mechanism needs to be improved so as to monitor the effects of developments in AI and facilitate
policymaking regarding said effects.

**International Cooperation**

International cooperation is of great importance in order to keep up with the developments
in R&D in emerging technology fields, to exchange experience, and to benefit from expansive
talent and capacity opportunities in human resources. Türkiye has strong international
cooperation in terms of R&D and innovation in AI. During the last 10 years, 75 AI projects carried


-----

out in cooperation with international organizations correspond to 10.5% of the total public

budget allocated for AI. In the EU Horizon 2020 Program, which includes our country and covers

the period of 2014-2020, 358 different AI project applications were made, with a total of 469

participants. 49 Turkish partners received €14 million worth of funding for a total of 27 projects.

Similarly, it is planned to participate in Horizon Europe Program covering the period 2021-2027

and Digital Europe Program, which will be opened for the first time. Along with the EU supported

GN2, GN3, GN3Plus and EGI-InSPIRE big data and high performance computing projects, of

which ULAKBİM is a stakeholder, R&D studies in Türkiye as well are carried out in cooperation

with international organizations.

Looking at the ranking of international collaborations in academic studies shown in Figure 18,

Türkiye ranks 25th in the world with a total of 1,922 publications published jointly with academics

from other countries between 2009 and 2018.[41 ]

At the Turkish-German Artificial Intelligence and Industry 4.0 Conference held in Germany
on August 22, 2019, in addition to the cooperation of the two countries in AI, further cooperation in
production-oriented fields such as the machinery industry was announced. This conference was
followed by the Turkish-Hungarian Artificial Intelligence and High Technology Conference held
online on October 15, 2020. At the event, besides the exchange of experience, potential bilateral
collaborations and other cooperation opportunities within the scope of EU multi-annual financial
framework programs were evaluated.

The _OECD Recommendation of the Council on Artificial Intelligence,_ published in 2019
in order to strengthen the global AI policy ecosystem by focusing on ethical and democratic
values, was adopted as the G20 Artificial Intelligence Principles as an appendix to the 2019 G20
Ministerial Statement on Trade and Digital Economy. At the G20 Digital Economy Ministers'
Meeting and Leaders Summit held in 2019 and 2020, the adoption of cross-border data transfer
for the development of the digital economy with the initiative of “Data Free Flow with Trust”
and its support by our country is important for ensuring the harmony of international trends
in the field of AI with the national vision. In this context, our country regularly takes part in the
works addressing AI-related issues and data governance within the body of the G20. Activities are
carried out for G20 countries to develop joint approaches and policies in AI, and knowledge and
experience are exchanged through these activities.

Turkish experts and observers also participate in the OECD ONE AI working groups, where
AI experts come together. With these working groups, it is aimed to prepare a guide that
includes recommendations for national policies and an implementation guide focusing on the
classification of AI systems and value-based trustworthy AI policies.

Our country actively participates in the meetings of the Ad Hoc Committee on Artificial
Intelligence (CAHAI), which has 47 members. The committee's works, which aim to identify the
elements of a legal framework for the development, design and implementation of AI based on
human rights, democracy and rule of law standards, are followed closely. The committee focuses
on establishing a legal framework for the development of AI algorithms, taking into account AI
ethics and data privacy. Our country participates in and contributes to the Policy Development
Group, Advisory and Support Group and Legal Frameworks Group, which were established as
part of mentioned works.

Considering the current situation of our country, it is considered important to participate in
global data governance and trustworthy AI initiatives in order to develop international cooperation
in AI. Again, in this area, it is necessary to develop technology and design application development
projects with partner countries or participate in the currently developed international projects
and programs.

**Structural and Workforce Transformation**

Existing as an effective power in the competitive digital economy of the future requires
keeping up with technological developments by designing new business models in accordance
with AI, and redefining and developing workforce competencies in this direction. The OECD
Report _Going Digital: Shaping Policies, Improving Lives reveals that low-skilled workers are_
less likely to receive in-service training than medium and high-skilled workers. The report also
presents the training status of employed workers in 2012 or 2015 based on their skill levels. Figure
20 shows that according to OECD data; while the average of low-skilled workers receiving training
is 40.3%, this rate is only 28.2% in our country.[47]

In our country, efforts to transform organizational structures, ways of doing business and
decision-making mechanisms, and pilot applications for services with high stakeholder interaction
have been initiated in order to prepare public institutions for next-generation technologies and
to have effective data-based decision-making processes. In this context;

-  Within the Ministry of Justice, decision support systems development projects are
carried out on topics such as voice assistant supported probation and enforcement
using open source AI development software. Efforts are underway to develop a
“chatbot” application for use in units such as the call center and help desk. In
line with “Smarter UYAP”, works on “Use of Big Data and Artificial Intelligence in
Enforcement Processes” are actively carried out. On the other hand, regulatory
works are carried out regarding the remote employment of AI experts to meet the
needs of the Ministry.


Within the scope of the Occupational Health and Safety Information Management
System, which continues its works within the Ministry of Labor and Social Security,
the factors of accident risk are mathematically modeled and risk profiles are created,
predictive modeling based on past work accident and occupational disease data,
and an early warning system for employees, employers and occupational health
and safety experts services are being developed.

For homeland security purposes, the Ministry of Interior carries out works that will
increase the capabilities of law enforcement officers by making use of AI applications
in projects to be realized with real-time event integration and advanced analytical
methods. In addition to real-time event support, works on AI applications are also
being carried out in order to predict future events and risks.


The Education Technologies Incubation and Innovation Center will be implemented
in 2021 by the Ministry of National Education, General Directorate of Innovation and
Education Technologies, within the scope of the World Bank's “Safe Schooling and
Distance Education Project”. The Center will operate in METU Technopolis and will

work in cooperation with the public-private sector. Within the scope of the project, an
innovation ecosystem in education will be developed, and through this ecosystem,
new digital tools and pedagogical models will be developed and released, and
blended education processes will be supported through the cooperation of various
stakeholders. In this direction, working groups for AI education will be established,
capacity building activities and R&D activities will be carried out for AI applications
in education.

The Ministry of Health is testing the use of robotic evaluation in radiological imaging
techniques. Within the scope of the Teleradiology System, an AI application that
diagnoses COVID-19 from Computed Tomography images was developed to assist
physicians in the diagnosis of COVID-19. With this study, images are classified in a
short time and the physician is given an idea regarding the diagnosis of COVID-19.
Similarly, AI studies are carried out for detecting lesions and calcifications in
mammography images and detecting Stroke (Present/Absent) and Stroke Type
(Occupying/Bleeding) using a dataset composed of brain imaging radiology reports
and the MR Diffusion images of the patient. Thanks to the integration, radiologists
can run the AI algorithm on the relevant image, and thus, they can see the areas
marked as lesion or calcified area. In addition, the e-Triage platform project named
“Neyim Var?” aims to direct appointment requests to the right polyclinic.

The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry actively uses AI applications based on
image processing in areas where quick decisions are required, such as fire and pest
control. It develops new solutions incorporating phenological observation poles
and photo traps in areas such as the sustainability of forest lands.

The Ministry of Trade carries out pilot studies to accelerate the customs procedures
with a focus on risk analysis by analyzing the data collected from different sources
such as closed circuit cameras, vehicle imaging devices and customs traffic, which
it has combined in the command and control center in Ankara within the scope
of customs enforcement, using advanced data analytics and machine learning
methods. On the Easy Export Platform, which is available for online use, an AIpowered smart export robot makes personalized recommendations to companies.

The Presidency of Defense Industries has initiated R&D projects that use AI
technologies for various problem areas and needs in defense and security. Some of
the projects carried out in this context are Social Media Anomaly Detection, Event
Tracking and Analysis, Deep Learning Big Data Analysis Platform, Social Media
Analysis Performance Improvement, Global Positioning System Independent
Autonomous Navigation Development, Classification and Identification of Surface
Targets Detected by Radar, Autonomous Reconnaissance with Collaborative
Robots, Guidance and Navigation, Artificial Intelligence Assistant Commander
Developing Movement Styles, Artificial Intelligence Assisted Fire Control and
Autonomous Driving for Land Vehicles, Artificial Intelligence Based Vulnerability
Detection and Prevention in Software Defined Networks and Global Vulnerability
Analysis.

The operating costs of ships are optimized by processing the data in communication,
navigational aids, ship automatic identification systems and long distance
ship identification and tracking systems with AI applications by the Ministry of


-----

Transport and Infrastructure General Directorate of Coastal Safety. Thanks to this
optimization, it is ensured that the greenhouse gas emissions from ships, which are
also prioritized by the International Maritime Organization, are reduced.

-  Within the “COVID-19 Detection with Artificial Intelligence” project carried out by
the DTO Big Data and Artificial Intelligence Department, the predictions made
by the developed AI models using the X-Ray and Computed Tomography images
and the reasoning for these predictions can be transparently presented to the
relevant doctors. Similarly, within the scope of the Turkish Brain Project, which was
implemented as a result of joint work with Gazi University Faculty of Engineering
and Faculty of Medicine, a decision support system is being developed that will
facilitate the detection and diagnosis of various anomalies from MR images by
using AI technologies, thus enabling rapid treatment of emergency cases and
reduce the possibility of various complications.

The use of industrial and service robots, which is another important area of AI use that is
becoming more popular, is becoming increasingly widespread in our country as well. While the
rate of industrial and service robot usage in private sector organizations is 5.1%, this rate rises to
19.6% in large-scale enterprises.[48] According to the International Robotics Federation, while there
are approximately 40 robots per 10,000 employees in the manufacturing sector and 200 robots
in the automotive sector.[49]

In terms of improving the use of AI applications in businesses, it is important to understand how
these applications are generalized within organizations. In a report prepared by an international
consultancy firm, it is stated that 15% of the companies surveyed consider themselves at an
advanced level in terms of AI maturity. In our country, the adoption of AI technologies by the
finance sector is faster than other sectors with the use of applications such as voice assistants,
financial risk analysis, and psychometric scoring. It is considered that AI applications will be used
more in areas that directly reach the consumer, customer, user or citizen. On the other hand,
AI applications are mostly (40%) implemented in the private sector in line with the demands of
senior management. Demands for AI applications come from both service and IT units (55%),
although IT units are considered to be more dominant.[50]

Considering Türkiye's situation in this area, it is seen that there is a need for structural
transformations for public institutions to benefit from AI technology and applications at the
highest level. In addition, it is necessary to carry out activities to take advantage of the opportunities
brought on by AI across all sectors. Another need is the harmonization of the existing workforce
in line with the transformations that AI will cause in the employment market.

NAIS was prepared on the basis of values and principles detailed below. It
is to be carried out with a human-centric approach in harmony, cooperation
and coordination with the participation of central and local government
institutions and organizations, private sector, academia, international
organizations and NGOs. It is expected that these values and principles will act
as a reference throughout the lifecycle of AI systems that will be developed or
put into use in our country, in line with the guidelines to be prepared following


**AI ethical frameworks are published**
**by international organizations in order**
**to help strengthen a global policy**
**ecosystem that protects**

**• human rights,**

**• democratic values and**

**• the rule of law**

**and to develop a common attitude by**

**centric AI principles determined by**
**OECD, G20, EU, and UNESCO, and**
**adopts “trustworthy and responsible**
**_AI” values and principles._**

the implementation of the NAIS.


-----

**AI Values**

**Respect for Human Rights, Democracy and the Rule of Law**

Human dignity, human rights and fundamental freedoms must be essential throughout the
lifecycle of AI systems. All AI technologies to be developed in our country should be designed in
compliance with national ethical values and by prioritizing human rights, democratic values and
the rule of law so that all members of society can benefit from such technologies. No human
should be harmed physically, economically, socially, politically or psychologically at any stage
in the lifecycle of AI systems. In interactions with AI systems throughout their lifecycle, people
should never be objectified, their dignity should never be harmed, and human rights should
never be violated or abused.

**Flourishing the Environment and Biological Ecosystem**

Environmental and biological ecosystem development is vital for humans and other living
organisms to benefit from advances in AI. Therefore, they must be recognized and supported
throughout the lifecycle of AI systems. All actors involved in the lifecycle of AI systems should
adhere to relevant international and national legislation, standards and practices designed for
the protection, restoration and sustainable development of the environment and ecosystem.

**Ensuring Diversity and Inclusiveness**

Respect, protection and promotion for diversity and inclusiveness must be ensured
throughout the lifecycle of AI systems, in a manner consistent with demographic, cultural, social
diversity and inclusiveness, as well as international human rights law, standards and principles.
The scope of lifestyle choices, beliefs, ideas, expressions, or personal experiences, including
the discretionary use and design of AI systems, should in no way be restricted at any stage of
the lifecycle of AI systems. Technological infrastructure, training and skills gaps should be
eliminated, and awareness level should be raised in order to benefit from AI systems and increase
inclusiveness. The production, development and implementation of AI technologies should not
result in discrimination in any way, and datasets should be audited in this regard. Effective public
participation should be ensured so that all members of the society can make informed decisions
about the use of AI systems and protect AI systems from undesirable effects.

**Living in Peaceful, Just and Interconnected Societies**

AI actors should play a facilitating role in helping everyone benefit from an interconnected
future for a harmonious and peaceful life. AI systems should contribute to the harmony and
interconnectedness of all living things and the natural environment throughout their lifecycle. AI
systems should not objectify, differentiate, or endanger any party.


-----

**AI Principles**

**Proportionality**

Legitimate goals and objectives must be adhered to throughout all stages of the lifecycle of
AI systems and everything must remain relevant to the context of said systems. Adequate risk
analysis should be carried out against any possible harm to human, environment or biological
ecosystem and necessary measures should be taken to prevent damage. The AI techniques to be
used should be determined in a way that is suitable for legitimate purposes and does not allow
the violation of AI values.

**Safety and Security**

In order to ensure the safety and security of humans, the environment and the biological
ecosystem, damage and vulnerabilities must be avoided throughout the lifecycle of AI systems.
All AI systems to be deployed or designed must be robust, stable and reliable; and potential risks
must be continuously evaluated and managed. For AI systems to be safe and secure, they must
be supported by sustainable and privacy-preserving data access frameworks that can enable
better training of AI models using quality data.

**Fairness**

AI systems should be designed to provide an equal and fair service to all stakeholders while
adhering to the rule of law and fundamental rights and freedoms. The fairness of AI systems
means that the benefits of AI technology are shared at local, national and international levels,
while taking into account the specific needs of different age groups, different cultural systems,
different language groups, people with disabilities, and disadvantaged, marginalized and
vulnerable segments of the society. It should be ensured that decisions made based on algorithms
do not give rise to discriminatory or unfair effects on different demographic populations. In
order to prevent the emergence of unintentional discrimination in decision-making processes,
monitoring and accountability mechanisms should be developed and those mechanisms should
be included in the implementation process.

**Privacy**

Privacy is a necessary right for human dignity and human autonomy that must be respected
and protected throughout the lifecycle of AI systems, at both the personal and societal levels. It is
important to collect, use, share, archive and delete the data used in AI systems in accordance with
AI values and principles. AI systems should be developed and operated in a way that does not
compromise the privacy and protection of personal data. The source and means of a collection
of personal data and how decisions made based on said data will affect people should always be
auditable. Universal and cultural ethical rules and the confidentiality of personal data should also
be considered with the same regard.


-----

**Transparency and Explainability**

Person(s) and organizations involved in the lifecycle of AI systems should ensure that the
AI system is transparent and explainable in accordance with its context. People have the right
to be informed of a decision that was made based on AI algorithms and to request explanatory
information from public institutions and private sector organizations in such cases. It should be
possible to explain to the end user and other stakeholders in non-technical terms and in plain
language, why, how, where and for what purpose the decisions made based on automatic and
algorithmic decisions, the data leading to said decisions and the information obtained from that
data are used.

**Responsibility and Accountability**

Person(s) and organizations involved in the lifecycle of AI systems are ultimately responsible
for the proper functioning of AI systems and the application of AI principles. In line with their roles
in the lifecycle, the context of the system and technological possibilities, these actors and their
ethical responsibilities should be able to be related to their liabilities regarding their decisions
and actions. Accountability should be appropriately distributed among actors. Necessary
mechanisms for human audit, impact analysis and risk assessment should be established.
Technical and organizational design should guarantee auditing and traceability of compliance
with AI values. Audit data should be available for third parties to research and review behavior
patterns of the AI system, in accordance with their mandate.

**Data Sovereignty**

International rules should be adhered to in the use of data throughout the lifecycle of AI
systems and the sovereignty rights of the parties should be respected. Measures should be taken
to activate secure data circulation in line with international obligations, national legislation and
AI values in the regulation of digital data produced in or passing through areas of sovereignty.
Data sharing between individuals and institutions should be provided in accordance with the
measures taken and the legal framework. In situations where the legal framework is unclear, AI
values and principles, especially human rights and privacy, should be prioritized.

**Multi-Stakeholder Governance**

The participation of different stakeholders throughout the lifecycle of AI systems is essential
for inclusive and agile AI governance, the benefits of AI passing through society, and for AI to
contribute to technological progress and development. Stakeholders of AI systems include
public institutions, NGOs, international organizations, researchers, academia, media, educators,
policy makers, the private sector, human rights institutions, and other bodies established for
the youth and children. It is important to adopt open standards and interoperability to facilitate
collaboration among AI stakeholders. Agile governance measures should be taken in line with
technological developments and new sociotechnical needs.

**Historical Development of AI**

Although the history of AI dates back to the 700s, its conceptual introduction into our lives
is not that far away. It all started by British Scientist Alan Turing searching for the answer to the
question “Can machines think?” in the 1950s. Around the same time, Ordinarius Professor Cahit
Arf presented his work titled “Can Machines Think and How?” at Erzurum Atatürk University.

Basically, AI is a discipline that is directly and intensely related to computer science and
mathematics. Nearly 70 years ago, the vision of AI was to build machines that could think, learn,
and reason like humans. The first AI systems were developed using the “identify the problemsolve the problem-code the solution-apply the solution” method. These systems are laborintensive systems that rely on traditional programming and mostly rule-based approaches. This
period was called “the first wave” and was brought to an end by the so-called “AI winter”, as the
theoretical studies had difficulty in finding a response in practice.

Setting out from the constraints of the first wave, instead of focusing on functions, researchers
worked on the systems that create them, and thus developed the artificial neural network
approach that is inspired by the neuron structure in humans. With the advent of 1980s, successful
studies began to be carried out in this field. The structures defined as neurons in artificial neural
network systems are modeled to be interconnected just as how actual neurons in biological
nervous systems interact with each other. The aim here is to provide the AI with abilities such as
learning, memorizing and revealing the relationship between data, as is the case is in humans. In
the early 1990s, AI studies continued as theoretical studies that could not be applied in practice
due to the limitations of the ability to operate on hardware available at the time. This period is
called the “second AI winter”.

Especially in the 2010s, the developments in software, the increase in processing power
and memory capacity, as well as the advances in cloud computing and distributed and parallel
information processing technologies have facilitated access to large databases and their usability.
The advanced processing power enabled the use of multi-layer artificial neural networks in
practice, and thus began the period called “second wave”, where deep learning applications
gained momentum. At this stage, AI applications have begun to take place in all areas of life, from
autonomous vehicles to production facilities and sound and image processing systems used for
various purposes. Therefore, we can say that we are living the “AI renaissance” today.[51]


-----

**The most common sub-fields of AI today are as follows:**

-  Machine learning: Systems based on algorithms that can learn from datasets and
whose performance can be improved with more data over time.

-  Artificial neural networks: Structures that learn how to perform a task by taking
advantage of data features, usually without being programmed with any taskspecific rules.

-  Deep learning: A more specialized subfield of AI that relies on complex statistical
models and algorithms with multiple layers of parallel processing that aims to
model the way the biological brain works in a simplified manner. Due to the need
for large datasets and powerful processing units to enable self-learning in deep
learning, successful results have only been achieved in the last 20 years.

There are various techniques and methods in AI applications, and these techniques can
sometimes be used on their own and sometimes in combination with other fields. This is also
called an AI system. For example, it is necessary to use natural language processing techniques
for some applications in audio technologies.

As a result, researchers have started to turn to AI technologies that can think, learn and
reason like humans, in line with the emergence vision of AI in its beginning. The main stages of
the development of this process, namely the “third wave”, can be expressed as follows:

Narrow AI: It is the name given to the first developmental stage of AI, which includes systems or
applications that can only perform certain tasks. This stage describes the majority of applications
so far. Chess and Go applications are among the examples for this stage, because the techniques
used cannot go beyond their determined purposes. This stage also includes assistive AI, which is
defined as the stage of work that supports people's work and facilitates their everyday lives.

General AI: It will be the stage when AI technologies will be able to do the things that human
intelligence can do both by learning and by improving itself. Thus, it is expected that systems
able to perform close to humans without human support in fields such as mathematics, physics,
art and law will emerge.

Super AI: It will be the stage where the systems will be far superior to humans in terms of
performance and achievement, and will be able to develop and learn beyond what humans
can perceive, make and implement completely independent decisions. When and under what
conditions this stage may take place or whether it will take place as predicted is completely
based on predictions.

Figure 25 summarizes the evolution of AI history chronologically.
