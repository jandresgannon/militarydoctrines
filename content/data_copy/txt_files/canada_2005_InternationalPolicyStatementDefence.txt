On behalf of the Government of Canada, I am pleased to introduce the defence
section of Canada’s International Policy Statement.

This document represents significant change. It is the first review of Canada’s
defence policy in more than 10 years and it defines a new policy that is firmly
grounded in the realities of the post-Cold War, post-September 11th world. It is
also informed by the rich operational experience of the Canadian Forces, both in
Canada and in locations ranging from Afghanistan to the Balkans to Haiti.

The tragedy of September 11, 2001 proved to Canadians that we are vulnerable to
the threat of terrorism and the spillover effects from failed and failing states. This
policy, therefore, establishes the defence of Canada as our first priority. The
Canadian Forces will be reorganized and retooled to tighten their focus on this
primary mandate.

The effective defence of Canada and North America has always required
working collaboratively with the United States. We will build on the successful
bilateral defence arrangements currently in place, such as NORAD. And we will seek to develop new, innovative
approaches to defence cooperation with the United States, to better meet the threats to both countries.

The Government recognizes that the Canadian Forces are a vital instrument of Canada’s foreign policy, especially in
today’s unstable world. Our new defence policy will give the Canadian Forces the guidance they need to help Canada
convey its distinct values and particular approach to conflict resolution around the world.

I look forward to the discussions this document will engender both in Parliament and across Canada. I believe they
will assure the best way forward for the Canadian Forces, one of Canada’s vital national institutions.

It is a privilege to be Minister of National Defence at this exciting time. The relevance and centrality of the Canadian
Forces to the broad agenda of the Government are ascendant. We have vibrant, new military leadership with
innovative ideas rooted in recent operational experience. We have some of the world’s most dedicated, professional,
skilful soldiers, sailors and air personnel. The Government has made a solid financial commitment to the Canadian
Forces that is unparalleled in the past two decades. And now, with this new defence policy statement, we have the
intellectual framework required to guide and shape the Canadian Forces to face the defence and security challenges
of the 21st century.

The Honourable Bill Graham
Minister of National Defence

###### CONCLUSION 32


-----

t the dawn of the 21st century, Canada
faces a complex array of security challenges.
The world remains an unpredictable and

# A

perilous place, where threats to our well-being, our
interests and our values persist. Failed and failing
states dot the international landscape, creating
despair and regional instability and providing a
haven for those who would attack us directly.
Global terrorism has become a deadly adversary,
and Canadians are now, in some ways, more
individually threatened than at any time during the
Cold War. The proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction, whether to state or non-state actors,
raises the horrible prospect of massive civilian and
military casualties. And intra- and inter-state
conflict continues throughout the world. These
developments affect Canadians as never before.

In this dangerous environment, Canadians look to
their government for reassurance and protection. **Off Baffin Island—Plotting the course aboard HMCS Montréal.**
The Government has responded. In the immediate
wake of September 11, 2001, it announced nearly threats and other emergencies both at home and abroad.

future needs. The Canadian Forces have already begun
a long-term transformation process that leads in this
direction, and recent investments will allow them to
make significant progress toward reaching their goals.

The purpose of this document is to guide the Canadian
Forces in their operations, and assist the Department of
National Defence in the development of a sustainable
long-term program. The policy rests upon the
principles and priorities identified in the National
Security Policy and the Overview of the International
Policy Statement. The Canadian Forces will continue to
perform three broad roles: protecting Canadians,
defending North America in cooperation with the
United States, and contributing to international peace
and security. To do so, our military must be effective,
relevant and responsive, and remain capable of carrying
out a range of operations, including combat.

Above all, this policy is about change, and providing
our military with a bold new vision to deal with an
increasingly uncertain world. The first challenge is to


strike the right balance between the Canadian Forces’
domestic and international roles. In the current security
environment, where the lines between these roles are
less distinct than ever, the military must continue to
carry out operations at home and overseas. The
Government believes, however, that a greater emphasis
must be placed on the defence of Canada and North
America than in the past. This must be the Canadian
Forces’ first priority. Current threats demand that we
pay increased attention to the safety and security of our
citizens at home, the most fundamental responsibility of
any government. In addition to strengthening the
capacity and capability of the Canadian Forces to carry
out their domestic roles in cooperation with other
government departments and agencies, we will
continue to explore new and innovative ways to
enhance relations with the United States to defend the
continent. A strong Canada-U.S. defence partnership
remains essential to our security.

The Government also recognizes the importance of
meeting threats to our security as far away from our
borders as possible, wherever they may
arise. Security in Canada ultimately
begins with stability abroad. While we
need to be selective and strategic when
deploying military personnel overseas,
focusing on where our interests are at
stake and where we can make a
meaningful contribution, the Canadian
Forces must retain a spectrum of
capabilities to operate with our allies on
international missions.

This is especially the case in failed and
failing states. Canadians are proud of
the role their military has played in
protecting people who cannot protect
themselves, in delivering humanitarian
assistance to those in desperate need,
and in rebuilding shattered
communities and societies. The
Canadian Forces will focus their
expeditionary capabilities on operations
in these states, including in a leadership

role when it is in Canada’s interest and ability to
do so. In these demanding and complex
environments, where civilians mix with friendly,
neutral and opposing forces, often in urban areas,
our military must be prepared to perform
different missions—humanitarian assistance,
stabilization operations, combat—all at the same
time. The Canadian Forces, with their modern
capabilities and highly developed skills in dealing
with people on the ground, can make a difference
in this respect.The Government is committed to
ensuring that the Forces are further strengthened
in this area, as part of an integrated strategy of
using diplomatic, defence and development assets
to help rebuild states.

By participating in these and other overseas
operations—and by increasing our emphasis on
foreign military training—the Canadian Forces
will enhance Canada’s status as a responsible and
contributing member of the international
community, including in key institutions such as
the United Nations and the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO). Investing in a strong
military is essential to achieving our foreign policy
goals and advancing our place in the world. With
Budget 2005, the Government has done just that.

###### FORCE EXPANSION

To improve their ability to carry out the domestic,
continental and international roles described
above, the Canadian Forces will be increased by
5,000 Regular and 3,000 Reserve personnel. This is
a major undertaking, and demonstrates the
Government’s commitment to an effective military
writ large, and to the individual personnel who put
their lives at risk on behalf of all Canadians. People
remain the greatest strength of Canada’s military. We
must ensure that they and their families enjoy the
quality of life they deserve.

With this expansion, the Canadian Forces will have
greater capacity to participate in challenging
international operations anywhere in the world,
especially in failed and failing states. The land forces,
for example, which will receive the vast majority of this
increase, will effectively double their capacity to


undertake operations overseas. Once this expansion is
completed, the Canadian Forces will be able to
continuously sustain up to 5,000 personnel on
international operations. These new Regular and
Reserve personnel will also help the Canadian Forces
better respond to domestic crises, such as natural
disasters and terrorist attacks.

###### TRANSFORMATION

At the same time, the Canadian Forces will pursue their
transformation efforts with renewed vigour and focus.


-----

As part of this process, the military will acquire new
technologies and equipment in order to operate
effectively in today’s challenging security environment
alongside our allies and other government and nongovernmental agencies. The Government has provided
significant new resources that will, among other things,
improve the Canadian Forces’ deployability, their
surveillance and weapons systems, and their ability to
lead and sustain operations.

Transformation, however, is not just about technology
and equipment modernization. It will require a
fundamental change to the culture of our military to
ensure a fully integrated and unified approach to
operations. This will require new command and
operational structures, including the creation of a
national operational command headquarters (Canada
Command), and fresh thinking surrounding concepts
and doctrine. It will mean introducing new
capabilities, while using existing ones in different and
innovative ways. Above all, it will put a premium on
having in place the right people with the right skills to
get the job done. They will provide both the ideas and
the leadership to help propel the Canadian Forces into
the future.

###### LOOKING AHEAD

The Government has put in place a sustainable defence
program to implement this policy. New investments
will support the expansion of the Canadian Forces and
enhance operational sustainability through


improvements in such areas as training, health care,
infrastructure, and spare parts and maintenance. They
will also lay the foundation for further transformation
and modernization efforts. National Defence will
publish a paper in the coming months detailing the
capabilities and force structure required to implement
the strategy described in this document.

This policy is the right one for Canadians. In the face of
unmistakable threats to our security, it identifies clear
priorities for our men and women in uniform and their
civilian counterparts, and sets a new course for a more
effective and more relevant military in the coming
years. The Canadian Forces will protect Canadians at
home, work closely with the United States in the
defence of the continent, and deploy around the world
with our friends and allies as part of a multilateral
approach to international problems.

The Government has listened to Canadians in the
development of this policy. The statement builds on
previous public consultations, including those carried
out during the 2002-03 Defence Update, and takes
account of the opinions expressed by stakeholders and
parliamentary committees in numerous reports over the
last several years. The Minister of National Defence has
also met with key defence experts. The Government
now looks forward to hearing the views of the House of
Commons and Senate defence committees and, of
course, the Canadian people, on the initiatives set out in
the following pages.

#### AT THE BEGINNING OF THE 21ST CENTURY

t has been just over 15 years since the
collapse of the Berlin Wall. The prospect
of a global conflict involving the major

# I

powers is still remote, and there remains no
Soviet-type military threat to Canadian
territory.


These concerns disappeared from view during
the 1990s, only to be replaced by new and
more complex threats that have proved
difficult to address. Failed and failing states
have resulted in civil wars, humanitarian
catastrophes and regional instability.
Terrorism has emerged as a global threat. The
international community has struggled to
respond to immediate crises and to develop
workable strategies for long-term security
problems, including the spread of weapons of
mass destruction. Long-standing tensions
remain in the Middle East, Africa and Asia,
with many conflicts seemingly immune to
permanent negotiated settlements.


**Kabul, Afghanistan—An infantry private on guard while desks and supplies are**
delivered to a school.


The 2001 attacks on New York and Washington reset
the international security agenda. They have also raised
the profile of domestic security, and the defence of the
continent that we share with the United States.

An increasingly interdependent world has tightened the
links between international and domestic security, and
developments abroad can affect the safety of Canadians
in unprecedented ways. Today’s front lines stretch from
the streets of Kabul to the rail lines of Madrid to our
own Canadian cities. The Government has made a
commitment to respond to potential threats to
Canadian security before they reach our shores.

The fluid nature of the international security
environment makes it difficult to predict the precise
threats that we might face even five years from now.
Nevertheless, in order to concentrate our efforts in areas
where Canada can make a difference, the Government
has decided to focus on failed and failing states.

###### FAILED AND FAILING STATES

Whether in Somalia, Afghanistan, Haiti or Sudan, the
past 15 years have confronted us with the concept and
consequences of failed and failing states. The inability


of governments in these countries, and others like them,
to maintain political authority, to provide security and
other basic services, and to protect essential human
rights has trapped millions of vulnerable civilians in a
cycle of misery, poverty and violence. With
environmental pressures, resource scarcity, pandemic
disease and urbanization added to the mix, this problem
will remain with us well into the future.

Failed and failing states pose a dual challenge for
Canada. In the first instance, the suffering that these
situations create is an affront to Canadian values.
Beyond this, they also plant the seeds of threats to
regional and global security. They generate refugee
flows that threaten the stability of their neighbours, and
create new political problems for their regions. More
ominously, the impotence of their governing structures
makes them potential breeding grounds or safe havens
for terrorism and organized crime.

###### TERRORISM

The attacks of September 11, 2001, ushered in a global
campaign against terrorists and those who support their
actions. This campaign is an international effort that
draws on contributions from many countries. It is also


-----

#### AT THE BEGINNING OF THE 21ST CENTURY


multi-faceted, with political, military and economic
dimensions that engage the armed forces, as well as the
law-enforcement, intelligence and financial communities.

The focus of the current campaign is on al-Qaeda and
like-minded groups. We have witnessed the willingness
and ability of this network and its affiliates to inflict
mass civilian casualties. The attacks since
September 11—in Madrid, Istanbul, Bali, Mombasa and
elsewhere—have shown that all states and societies,
including Canada, are a potential target.

The international campaign has weakened al-Qaeda,
damaged its organizational structure, and eliminated
some of its key personnel. Coalition and NATO
operations in Afghanistan have deprived the network
of its most effective base, including training and
laboratory facilities. The Afghan example may serve as
a warning to other countries to think twice before
sheltering terrorists.

But we have not seen the end of terrorism as a threat to
international peace and security. The disruption of
al-Qaeda’s leadership has not led to the elimination of
all of its prominent figures, its global links, or its
support of local insurgents and other sympathetic
groups. Moreover, related terrorist networks, which
retain effective ways to transmit their message, continue
to attract new recruits. Evidence persists that major
attacks against Western countries and interests are
likely, and the scenarios being discussed include the use
of weapons of mass destruction.

###### WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION

Chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear weapons,
and their means of delivery, continue to spread. A
number of states have, or are seeking, these capabilities
in an effort to gain international prestige, deter
adversaries or strengthen their relative positions in
regional disputes. Dangerous states and terrorist groups
have sought these weapons in an attempt to offset the
conventional military superiority of developed countries
or intimidate civilian populations. In their quest to
acquire such weapons, they have been aided by states
that exploit treaties intended to promote the peaceful
use of technology, and by illicit commercial networks
with access to materials and know-how.


There has been some progress in arms control,
including landmark agreements such as the 2002
Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty that will
dramatically shrink U.S. and Russian operational
nuclear forces. The bulk of the international
community supports the existing non-proliferation
regime, anchored in traditional instruments such as the
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty of 1968. There have
also been new initiatives such as the G8 Global
Partnership Program, which aims to prevent the spread
of materials and expertise related to weapons of mass
destruction from the former Soviet Union, and the
Proliferation Security Initiative, which seeks to interdict
the traffic in similar materials and their means of
delivery. That said, the international arms control
framework remains under pressure. Not all nations are
supportive, and a number of agreements have no legally
binding or enforcement mechanisms.

###### REGIONAL FLASHPOINTS

A number of long-standing “hot spots” persist around
the globe. Although they are unlikely to erupt into
major regional wars in the near future, the possibility
cannot be discounted. North Korea’s nuclear
brinkmanship and ongoing tensions between Taiwan
and China remain serious concerns in the region.
Despite recent positive developments, the confrontation
between India and Pakistan has not yet been resolved.
The situation in the Middle East, whether in the form
of the Israeli-Palestinian dispute, instability in Iraq, or
Iran’s nuclear ambitions, continues to have a significant
impact on international security.

###### CONCLUSION

Today’s international security environment poses
complex challenges, whether in the form of failed and
failing states, global terrorism, the spread of weapons of
mass destruction or ongoing regional tensions. Canada,
working in close partnership with friends and allies,
must do its part to confront them. To this end, the
Government will pursue an integrated strategy that
draws on Canada’s diplomatic, development and
defence resources. This includes a central role for the
Canadian Forces.

trends that are likely to continue in the future is critical
to determining the kind of military forces Canada will
require to meet the security challenges of a new century.

###### OPERATIONAL TEMPO


The operational tempo of the Canadian Forces over the
last decade has been demanding for our men and
women in uniform. Since 1990, the number of


###### OPERATIONAL TEMPO

This term refers to the number and size of missions undertaken by a military force relative to its strength. It also takes
into account the complexity and length of these operations. A high operational tempo, therefore, indicates a significant
number of sizeable, ongoing deployments to multiple theatres. The graph below shows the increasing operational
tempo of the Canadian Forces since 1990. As recently as May 2004, Canada ranked second among NATO nations in
the percentage of personnel deployed on multinational operations and sixth in terms of total numbers.

operations in which our military has participated has
tripled compared to the period between 1945 and
1989. The number of personnel deployed on foreign
operations has frequently exceeded the sustainable
ceiling of 4,000 set in the 1994 Defence White Paper.
At the same time, it was not anticipated that the
Canadian Forces would so often deploy
simultaneously and for lengthy periods to so many
theatres around the globe.

All this led to an over-stretch of our armed forces,
particularly for many smaller, specialized occupations
such as engineers and doctors. This, in turn, affected
the military’s ability to sustain operations and the
quality of life of our men and women in uniform and
their families. Indeed, the strain of our military’s
operational tempo has created a new generation of
Canadian Forces veterans—those who have served in
the many complex peace support operations of recent
years. Recognition of the problems facing these new
veterans—such as Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder—
has led the Department and the Forces to work closely
with Veterans Affairs Canada toward developing a
modern version of the Veterans’ Charter.

The challenges of adapting to the demands of the postCold War operational environment have not been
unique to the Canadian Forces—other Western
militaries experienced similar problems. The
Government, with the recent budget, has recognized
that the level of funding provided to the Canadian
Forces during the past decade can no longer support
the level of operational activity that we have come to
expect, while also paving the way for transformation.

###### INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS

The range of Canadian Forces’ international missions
in recent years has been striking. It has included highprofile operations such as the campaign against
terrorism and the deployment of the Disaster Assistance
Response Team (DART) to countries such as Sri Lanka
that have been devastated by natural disasters. It has
also covered operations that did not command the same
public attention but were nonetheless important, from
enforcing sanctions to carrying out conventional arms
control inspections.


Joint Task Force 2, the Canadian Forces special operations and counterterrorism unit.

Certain operational trends have emerged during this
period. With a few exceptions, most of the Canadian
Forces’ major operations have borne no resemblance to
the traditional peacekeeping model of lightly armed
observers supervising a negotiated ceasefire. Missions
are now far more complex and dangerous, with our
troops frequently deployed to failed and failing states
such as Haiti and Afghanistan where there is little if
any peace to keep. As part of these operations, they have
been confronted with new dangers, from rare diseases,
to civil disorder, to clashes with irregular forces in
urban areas.

Military experts have compared today’s complex and
chaotic operational environment to a “three-block war.”
This term speaks to the increasing overlap in the
missions armed forces are being asked to carry out at
any one time, and the resulting need for integrated
operations. Our land forces could be engaged in combat
operations against well-armed militia forces in one city
block, stabilization operations in the next block, and
humanitarian relief and reconstruction two blocks over.
Transition from one type of operation to another often
happens in the blink of an eye, with little time to react.
At the same time, our naval forces in adjacent coastal
areas might be supporting troops ashore while
enforcing a maritime exclusion zone, and our air forces
could be flying in supplies and humanitarian aid, while
standing by to directly engage a determined opponent.


-----

The Balkans and Afghanistan provided an initial
glimpse of this environment, and the skills of highly
professional forces have been required to carry out what
have become increasingly integrated operations. The
Canadian Forces have gained a well-deserved
reputation in these types of missions, bringing to bear
the full range of their military expertise.

While these complex peace support operations have
become more common, so too have full-scale combat
missions. For example, Canadian CF-18 aircraft
played a significant role in the 1999 air campaign
against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. And,
during the deployment to Kandahar in 2002, our land
and special operations forces were involved in
numerous combat operations alongside allied forces,
hunting down members of the Taliban and al-Qaeda
in the Afghan mountains.

As part of the same campaign against terrorism,
Canadian ships deployed to the Persian Gulf region,
protecting and supporting other allied navies and
hailing and boarding vessels of interest to prevent
al-Qaeda and Taliban members from escaping the
region by sea. Sea King helicopters, Airbus and
Hercules transports, and Aurora long-range
patrol aircraft also provided critical support to
Canadian and coalition forces.

As this operational environment has evolved, the
Canadian Forces have had to work more closely
with their allied counterparts. They have made
enormous strides in this direction. Today, our
ships integrate seamlessly with U.S. Navy
formations. As part of the air campaign in
Kosovo, our aircrews worked hand-in-glove with
those of other NATO forces. And in Afghanistan,
our land and special operations forces proved
their mettle with the best in the world.
Interoperability—the ability of armed forces to
work together effectively on operations—will
remain an essential ingredient in future
multinational operations.

The flexibility, competence and professionalism of
the Canadian Forces have not been lost on

Canada’s allies. This explains why our military
continues to be one of the first to be called upon to
participate in international missions, and why Canadians
are often asked to fill the most demanding command
and staff positions. The Canadian Forces’ ability to
work in both of our official languages has also enhanced
their reputation abroad. Their bilingual expertise
enables them to operate equally effectively in countries
of la Francophonie, such as Haiti, or in Commonwealth
states such as Sierra Leone.

The challenges involved in rebuilding countries
devastated by war or internal strife are enormous and
cannot be handled by military forces alone. Instead,
they demand the involvement of other government
departments and non-governmental organizations.
Canada’s recent experience in Afghanistan points to the
ongoing need for close collaboration between National
Defence, Foreign Affairs and the Canadian
International Development Agency in pursuit of
common objectives. For peace and reconstruction

efforts to take root, effective cooperation with local
governments is also essential.

###### RECENT DOMESTIC OPERATIONS

While dealing with a high operational tempo overseas,
the Canadian Forces have also had to contend with
demands at home that have been heavier than at any
time since the end of the Second World War. They have
responded in impressive fashion, and reassured
Canadians that they are ready to answer the call for
help at a moment’s notice.

During the past 10 years, the Canadian Forces have
conducted thousands of sovereignty and search and
rescue missions. They have assisted other government
departments in deterring illegal fishing, countering
drug smuggling, intercepting ships carrying illegal
migrants and protecting our environment. In addition,
the Forces have helped civilian authorities respond to


natural disasters and other incidents, including floods,
ice storms, forest fires, hurricanes, plane crashes and the
Year 2000 transition. They also deployed more than
5,000 personnel, as well as air defence weapons, CF-18
fighters, Hercules transport aircraft and helicopters, in
support of the 2002 G8 Summit in Kananaskis. Finally,
as part of their North American Aerospace Defence
Command (NORAD) commitment, Canadian Forces
fighter aircraft have increased their patrols to ensure the
safety of our skies following the attacks of September 11.

The Canadian Forces have played an important role in
asserting Canadian sovereignty in the North. Today,
their activities include the work of Northern Area
Headquarters in Yellowknife, the operation of the
signals facility at Alert, overflights by our long-range
patrol and Twin Otter aircraft, and periodic exercises.
The Canadian Rangers, part-time Reservists who
provide a military presence in remote, isolated and
coastal communities in the North, report unusual
activities or sightings, and conduct surveillance or
sovereignty patrols as required.

###### LOOKING TO THE FUTURE: A NEW VISION FOR THE CANADIAN FORCES

There will be no decline in the demand for the
Canadian Forces overseas. The UN and NATO value
well-trained and experienced armed forces, and
Western nations, including Canada, have been
frequently called upon to provide the modern, robust
forces required for the kinds of operations that have
taken place in Kosovo, Haiti and Afghanistan. Nor can
we expect that the demands on the Canadian Forces at
home will decrease. Indeed, given the changed context
of domestic and continental security, the military may
be asked to increase its support to other government
departments and agencies to enhance the protection of
Canadians, our territory, and our air and maritime
approaches.

In this environment, Canada will continue to maintain
modern, combat-capable maritime, land, air and special
operations forces. Given their nationwide presence and
specific skills, the Reserves will remain an essential part
of our overall national military posture.


-----

The ability to respond to the challenge of
failed and failing states will serve as a
benchmark for the Canadian Forces. While
this focus will not see the Forces replicate
every function of the world’s premier
militaries, the task of restoring order to war
zones will require Canada to maintain
armed forces with substantial capabilities.
These same capabilities will also enable the
Canadian Forces to respond to other
international contingencies, providing
insurance against unexpected developments
in an ever-changing world.

Making a difference means being able to
work with others. The Canadian Forces

breakneck speed. Professional and highly
competent people, available when required and in
sufficient numbers, are the Forces’ most valued
resource. To this end, recruitment and retention
will remain one of the Forces’ top priorities.

###### Transforming the Canadian Forces: A Focus on Integrated Operations

These goals demand that the Canadian Forces move
beyond traditional thinking. Consequently, the
operational transformation of the Canadian Forces
will focus on the establishment of new joint
organizations and combat structures that can meet the
Government’s expectations for effectiveness, relevance
and responsiveness.

Specifically, the Canadian Forces will have the ability to
deploy three kinds of joint formations.

- A Special Operations Group will be established to
respond to terrorism and threats to Canadians and
Canadian interests around the world. This group
will include Joint Task Force 2, our special
operations and counterterrorism unit; a special
operations aviation capability centred on
helicopters; and supporting land and maritime
forces. The Special Operations Group will be
capable of operating as an independent unit or
contributing to other joint force structures.
Integrating our special operations forces in this
manner will increase their impact in operations, as
well as the range of options available to government

- A Standing Contingency Task Force will be
established to respond rapidly to emerging
crises. This high-readiness task force will
be made up of existing, designated
maritime, land, air and special operations
elements, organized under a single
integrated combat command structure. It
will be ready to deploy with 10 days’ notice,
and provide an initial Canadian Forces
presence to work with security partners to

With respect to maritime capabilities, the Canadian
Forces will:

- enhance the ability of their ships to support the
Special Operations Group, and carry out littoral
operations as part of the Standing Contingency
Task Force and Mission-Specific Task Forces;

- proceed with the acquisition of ships that will be
able to:

  - pre-position or deploy the Standing
Contingency Task Force,

  - support land operations,

  - provide a sea-based national or multinational
command capability,

  - deploy tactical unmanned aerial vehicles, and

  - sustain naval task group operations worldwide;

- complete, in the near term, the process of bringing
the Victoria-class submarines into service. This will
provide the Canadian Forces with a flexible and
highly capable platform to conduct a wide range of
operations in our waters and overseas;

- modernize the combat systems and electronics of
the Halifax-class frigates to maintain their ability to

- acquire weapon systems for surface ships to enable
them to support and protect forces operating
ashore; and



 - begin to define the requirements for a new class of

surface ship to replace the current destroyers and
frigates over the longer term.

With respect to aerospace capabilities, the Canadian
Forces will:

 - complete the modernization of the CF-18 through

the acquisition of a satellite-guided air-to-ground
weapons capability to reflect the increased focus on
close support to ground forces, while retaining its
air-to-air capability at existing levels;

 - complete the acquisition of new maritime

helicopters;

 - acquire medium- to heavy-lift helicopters, as

announced in Budget 2005, to support land and
special operations missions, including transporting
large numbers of personnel and heavy equipment
from forward deployed bases or from a maritime
platform;

- replace the Buffalo and Hercules aircraft used for
fixed-wing search and rescue;

- acquire, or ensure access to, the right mix of
capabilities to meet the increasing requirements for
domestic, global and in-theatre airlift;

- complete the modernization of the Aurora
maritime patrol aircraft;

- complete the conversion of two Airbus aircraft into
air-to-air refuellers;

- acquire unmanned aerial vehicles to support
domestic and international operations; and

- pursue the use of satellites to support domestic and
international operations.

With respect to land capabilities, the Canadian Forces
will:

- increase the size of their Regular units as part of the
expansion of the Forces by 5,000 people. By
increasing the “tooth-to-tail ratio”—the number of
people capable of being deployed on operations
compared to those in administrative overhead—the
land forces will be able to more effectively support

Canadian Forces’ ability to respond
to domestic contingencies and address specific
capabilities required for overseas deployments;

- complete the acquisition and development of
intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance
systems, and integrate these into other Canadian
Forces and allied sensor systems; and

- continue to transform into a modern, combatcapable medium-weight force, based primarily on
wheeled Light Armoured Vehicles, including the
Mobile Gun System and the Multi-Mission Effects
Vehicle (to replace the direct-fire role of the
Leopard tank), a new platform to deliver indirect
fire, and a new fleet of medium transport trucks.

With respect to disaster relief, the Canadian Forces will:

- enhance the capabilities of the Disaster Assistance
Response Team. Building on lessons learned over
the past several years (including the most recent
deployment to Sri Lanka), the Forces will examine
ways to make the team more deployable, including
by making it lighter and more modular, that is,
capable of being deployed in different combinations
of its component parts.

#### AND CANADIANS

n the unambiguous words of the 2004 National
Security Policy, “there can be no greater role, no
more important obligation for a government, than

# I

the protection and safety of its citizens.” In a country as
large, sparsely populated and geographically diverse as
Canada, surrounded by three oceans, this has never
been an easy task. Although new technologies have
made monitoring and protecting our homeland easier,
carrying out this fundamental responsibility remains a
formidable challenge.

The previous section highlighted the many ways in
which the Canadian Forces assisted the Government in
protecting Canadians at home in the last decade—from
conducting surveillance to assisting their fellow citizens
in times of crisis. Beyond that, the Canadian Forces
have stood ready to assist provinces and territories in
maintaining or restoring law and order when it is
beyond the power of civil authorities to do so. Although
operations in Aid of the Civil Power have been
infrequent (only four times in the past 35 years), the
role of the military has been critical in every case.

###### A NEW DOMESTIC CONTEXT

In the new century, however, the Canadian Forces must
also be prepared to support civil authorities in dealing
with terrorism, a threat that is likely to persist well into
the future. The Government’s response to the attacks on
the World Trade Center and the Pentagon has been
unequivocal and determined. A series of measures set
out in the 2001 Budget bolstered Canada’s national
security by $7.7 billion over five years. Some of these
measures were directly related to National Defence,


which received $1.2 billion in additional funding. For
example, the Government:

- committed more resources to expand Joint Task
Force 2;

- established the Joint Nuclear, Biological and
Chemical Defence Company; and

- improved the Communications Security
Establishment’s ability to gather intelligence on
possible threats to our security.

More recently, the Government has taken further steps
to improve domestic security, including the creation of
Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness Canada and
by appointing a National Security Advisor to the Prime
Minister. It has also developed a comprehensive and
integrated strategy for addressing current and future
threats to Canada under the National Security Policy.
This policy identifies specific threats to Canadians,
articulates our national security interests and provides a
blueprint for action in numerous areas, including
marine security and intelligence.

Notwithstanding these measures, we cannot—and will
not—relax our efforts to combat terrorism. The public
expects the Government to remain vigilant in
protecting Canadians and defending our sovereignty
and territory. It will be a challenge. New threats are
wide ranging and complex, and it is impossible to
predict with certainty the precise forms they will take.

One of the most critical security issues now facing the
Government is its ability to conduct surveillance of our
vast territory, airspace and maritime approaches, and to


###### THE NATIONAL SECURITY POLICY AND DEFENCE

The interdepartmental Marine Security Operations Centres being established in Halifax and Esquimalt will bring
together civilian and military resources to detect, assess and respond to marine security threats. The maritime forces
will also increase on-water patrols and aerial surveillance, and work even more closely with the United States in
protecting and defending our coasts and territorial waters.

Canada’s intelligence capacity is being enhanced through the creation of an Integrated Threat Assessment Centre at
the Canadian Security Intelligence Service. The Centre, which will include National Defence personnel, will more
efficiently gather, assess and disseminate intelligence. The Government is also expanding the intelligence-collection,
threat assessment and crisis-response capabilities of the Communications Security Establishment, and is working with
the United States to establish a North American cyber-threat early warning system.


-----

respond to asymmetric threats. For instance, an attack
using weapons of mass destruction on one of Canada’s
many ports of entry would not only threaten the safety
of those who work or live in the vicinity, but also
reverberate throughout North America. Similarly,
although we no longer face the threat of Soviet bombers
in Canadian airspace, terrorist groups may be seeking to
acquire the means to strike using not only hijacked
airliners, but also, possibly, crop dusters, drones, and
even cruise missiles fired from container ships or other
platforms off our coasts. The Government must
improve how it gathers, tracks, analyzes, uses and
shares information, particularly as it relates to the huge
volume of air, land and sea activity within our areas of
jurisdiction, and be better prepared to respond quickly
and effectively to incidents. National Defence will play
a critical role in these efforts.

The demands of sovereignty and security for the
Government could become even more pressing as
activity in the North continues to rise. The mining of
diamonds, for example, is expanding the region’s
economy and spurring population growth. Air traffic
over the high Arctic is increasing, and climate change
could lead to more commercial vessel traffic in our
northern waters. These developments will not result in
the type of military threat to the North that we saw
during the Cold War, but they could have long-term
security implications. Although the primary
responsibility for dealing with issues such as
sovereignty and environmental protection, organized
crime, and people and drug smuggling rests with other
departments, the Canadian Forces will
be affected in a number of ways. There
will, for example, be a greater
requirement for surveillance and
control, as well as for search and rescue.
Adversaries could be tempted to take
advantage of new opportunities unless
we are prepared to deal with
asymmetric threats that are staged
through the North.

#### AND CANADIANS

###### THE CANADIAN FORCES AND PROTECTING CANADA: A NEW APPROACH

In the face of these challenges, the first priority of our
military will be the defence of Canada. While the
Canadian Forces will continue to serve Canadians in
familiar roles, including search and rescue, disaster
relief and support to other government departments
such as Fisheries and Oceans and Environment Canada,
they will also contribute to the Government’s overall
strategy to protect Canadians against the threat of
terrorism. As part of this strategy, the Forces will:

- work more closely with civil authorities (at the
federal, provincial and local levels) to prevent
serious threats to Canada from materializing,
countering these threats if prevention fails, and
helping mitigate the consequences of an attack
should one occur;

- increase their efforts to ensure the sovereignty and
security of our territory, airspace and maritime
approaches, including in the Arctic;

- improve the gathering, analyzing, integrating and
use of information gained from a combination of
maritime, land, air and space surveillance systems;

- dedicate specific resources—people, training and
equipment—to enhance their ability to carry out
domestic roles; and


-----

#### AND CANADIANS

  - expand their presence across the country while
improving their ability to move people and
equipment more rapidly to where they are needed.

To carry out these activities, the Canadian Forces will
re-examine their entire approach to domestic operations.
In the past, Canada has structured its military primarily
for international operations, while the domestic role has
been treated as a secondary consideration. At home, the
military’s response has been to assemble a temporary
force drawn from existing structures designed for other
purposes, using the resources immediately available to
the local commander. Clearly, this approach will no
longer suffice.

In improving their ability to respond to domestic
requirements, the Forces will view Canada as a single
operational area. In place of the current command
structure, which is focused primarily on managing
training and administration, the Canadian Forces will
establish a single integrated structure that will be able to
bring the best available military resources from across
Canada to bear on a contingency, wherever it occurs,
nationwide. The new structure will be linked to a
smaller number of integrated regional headquarters.
This approach will take advantage of the presence that
the Forces maintain across Canada, as well as the
general and specialized operational competence of our
personnel, both Regular and Reserve.

The effects of this new approach—a new command
structure, with the emphasis on being able to bring an
integrated military response to a given area to
maximum effect—will also be seen in the
North. Through a combination of
enhanced surveillance (from satellites,
unmanned aerial vehicles and radars), a
more visible military presence and other
improved capabilities (including airlift
and communications), the Canadian
Forces will be better able to respond to
northern contingencies, and the
Government will be able to more strongly
assert Canada’s interest in this vital region
of the country.

###### FUTURE TASKS OF THE CANADIAN FORCES

To support more effectively the Government’s essential
role in providing for the safety and security of
Canadians, and in keeping with a fully integrated and
unified approach to operations, the Canadian Forces
will focus their efforts in the following areas.

With respect to national assets, the Canadian Forces
will:

- establish a single national command structure
(Canada Command) to respond to national
contingencies; and

- enhance their relationships with civil authorities.
This will include sharing information as well as
developing and exercising plans, so that, in the
event of a crisis, the Forces can make a timely,
effective contribution to the Government’s
overriding objective to protect Canadians.

With respect to special operations forces, the Canadian
Forces will:

- enhance the national counterterrorism response
force (Joint Task Force 2) to deal with emergencies
in different parts of the country;

- enhance the Joint Nuclear, Biological and Chemical

he United States remains Canada’s most
important ally. The friendship between our two
countries is unique, based on shared experiences

# T

and values and underpinned by a close economic
interdependence. Our defence and security relationship
is long-standing, well entrenched and as extensive as
any in the world. Both Canada and the United States
share the understanding, growing out of the 1940
Ogdensburg Declaration, that North America’s security
is indivisible.

Canada has benefited immensely from its defence
partnership with the United States over the years.
Our bilateral cooperation continues to provide us with
a degree of security that we could never achieve on
our own.

###### A NEW NORTH AMERICAN DEFENCE AND SECURITY CONTEXT

For more than 60 years, our defence relationship has
evolved to meet new and emerging threats. It may now
be entering a period of change like no other, as the
security of North America has taken on a new
dimension in the wake of the terrorist attacks.

For Canada, the United States’ more assertive role on
the world stage and growing sense of vulnerability
at home have implications across the
socio-economic, political, diplomatic
and defence spectrum. Whether within
a continental or global context,
developments within the U.S. will
profoundly affect Canada for years to
come.

Indeed, Canada’s security has become
more closely linked than ever to that of
its southern neighbour—and vice versa.
Canada’s geography is, from an
American viewpoint, destined to regain
the importance it lost after the end of

**Indian Ocean—Canadian Frigate HMCS Toronto**

#### IN A CHANGING WORLD

the Cold War. Given our shared border and
infrastructure and extensive bilateral trade, most of the
new dangers to the United States are no less risks to
Canada. For example, a serious terrorist incident
occurring close to the Canada-U.S. border would
undoubtedly threaten the physical safety of Canadians
and Americans, not to mention the free flow of goods
and people between our two countries on which our
economy so greatly depends.

The United States, with its increased focus on
homeland security, has already demonstrated that it is
prepared to expend considerable energy and resources
to protect its people and territory, and to defend its
interests. This stands out clearly, for example, with the
establishment of the Department of Homeland Security
and Northern Command. The latter is specifically
dedicated to the defence of U.S. territory and its
approaches, and the coordination of military assistance
to American civil authorities.

###### THE CANADIAN FORCES AND NORTH AMERICAN DEFENCE: A NEW APPROACH

It is clearly in our sovereign interest to continue doing
our part in defending the continent with the United
States. Our intent to do so was clearly reflected in the
security and defence measures announced in recent

#### IN A CHANGING WORLD

budgets, the signing of the Smart Border Declaration in
2001, the establishment of the Bi-National Planning
Group in 2002, the publication of the National Security
Policy (which calls for closer cooperation with the
United States in protecting and defending our coasts
and territorial waters) and the 2004 Joint Statement on
_Common Security, Common Prosperity: A New_
_Partnership in North America._

These initiatives, while significant, are not enough. As
part of our new, more sophisticated approach to our
relationship with the United States, we will renew our
commitment to continental defence, including through
enhancing our domestic capabilities and establishing a
single national command structure. The Government
will also pursue further practical ways of strengthening
our continental defence architecture and bilateral
consultative mechanisms.

###### Enhanced North American Defence Cooperation

The centerpiece of our defence relationship with the
United States remains the North American Aerospace
Defence Command. Its importance was underscored on
September 11, when it helped restore control of
continental airspace within hours of the terrorist
attacks. Since then, NORAD has confirmed its
relevance by continuing to adapt to the new threat
environment. It has increased its operational readiness
and tempo and is now responding to threats from both
inside and outside North America’s airspace. Canada
confirmed its commitment to the bi-national command
in August 2004 by amending the NORAD Agreement
so that its missile warning capabilities, which have been
in place for 30 years, would be made available to U.S.
commands responsible for missile defence.


NORAD’s mandate is to respond to aerospace threats.
It does not have the authority to counter maritime
threats (such as a ship carrying a dirty bomb into New
York or Halifax harbour) or to deal with the aftermath
of a terrorist attack on North American soil. Our
countries have made significant progress in enhancing
defence cooperation to address these challenges,
including through the Bi-National Planning Group.
More needs to be done. Canada will examine with the
United States a number of security and defence areas in
which our two countries could work more closely
together, including:

- preventing or mitigating the impact of potential
maritime attacks by:

  - increasing bi-national maritime surveillance
activities, and

  - enhancing the sharing of maritime intelligence,
information and assessments to better advise
and warn both governments;

- improving our ability to respond to maritime crises,
on a case-by-case basis, with the formal approval of
both governments; and

- developing military-to-military arrangements for
the support of civilian authorities during crises and
emergencies.

The Government will begin substantive discussions
with the United States in all of these areas in the
coming months, including as part of the upcoming
negotiations to renew the NORAD Agreement, which
is set to expire in 2006. Moving ahead on these issues is
important, particularly in light of the January 2005 U.S.
Presidential Directive calling for the development of a
national strategy for maritime security. This will
undoubtedly have implications for Canada.


###### THE BI-NATIONAL PLANNING GROUP

Following the tragic events of September 11, American and Canadian officials began discussing ways of cooperating
more closely to ensure the safety and security of their citizens. These discussions led to the establishment of the BiNational Planning Group (BPG) in December 2002. The BPG is co-located with NORAD in Colorado Springs and
headed by a Canadian Lieutenant-General, who is also Deputy Commander of NORAD. Close to 60 military
personnel work at the BPG, including about 30 Canadians. Its responsibilities include sharing information, developing
contingency plans, supporting civilian agencies, and improving cooperation with respect to maritime threats as well as
land incidents such as terrorist attacks or natural disasters. The BPG’s initial two-year mandate has been extended
until 2006.

#### IN A CHANGING WORLD


###### NORTH AMERICAN AEROSPACE DEFENCE COMMAND

NORAD is a bi-national military organization established in 1958 by Canada and the United States to monitor and
defend North American aerospace. Its headquarters are located in Colorado Springs. The Commander of NORAD is
appointed by, and responsible to, both the Prime Minister of Canada and the President of the United States. By
tradition, the Commander is an American and the Deputy Commander a Canadian. NORAD operates a network of
ground-based radars, sensors and fighter jets to detect, intercept and, if necessary, engage aerospace threats to the
continent. On September 11, NORAD played a vital part in helping ground civilian air traffic in North America and
has since increased its role in protecting North American cities and critical infrastructure. Over 700 Canadian Forces
personnel are assigned to NORAD, including in North Bay, Ontario.


As part of this new approach to continental defence,
Canada will also examine greater cooperation with
Mexico on security issues.

###### The Permanent Joint Board on Defence

The Permanent Joint Board on Defence was created in
1940 and constitutes the senior bilateral advisory body
on continental security. The board meets semi-annually
and is composed of national sections made up of
diplomatic and military representatives. It has served
both Canada and the United States well for over
60 years and continues to be relevant. The board’s
ability to provide useful policy advice to governments
has been strengthened by reducing the size of its
permanent membership, adding participants from key
security partner agencies and focusing agendas on
specific policy issues that can be discussed in depth.
Canada will encourage the board to consider North
American defence in the context of the new security
environment, particularly the relationship between
homeland defence, continental defence and
international security, and to explore further ways of
improving the body’s effectiveness.


###### FUTURE TASKS OF THE CANADIAN FORCES

The Canadian Forces will enhance their role in
defending the North American continent by:

- strengthening their ability to counter threats in
Canada, especially in terms of monitoring and
controlling activity in the air and maritime
approaches to our territory;

- continuing to contribute Canadian aircraft and
other assets to the NORAD mission;

- ensuring that maritime forces, both regular and
reserve, cooperate even more closely with the U.S.
Navy and Coast Guard;

- improving their ability to operate alongside
American forces, including through more frequent
combined training and exercises;

- exploring with the United States ways to enhance
our bi-national defence cooperation, especially in
the areas of maritime security and military support
to civilian authorities; and

- continuing to participate in international operations
overseas to address threats at their source.

Cyprus, the Persian Gulf, the Balkans, Afghanistan—
the names have become synonymous with Canadian
sacrifice and valour. Canadian soldiers, sailors and air
personnel have deployed overseas to ensure that their
fellow citizens at home remain safe and their way of life
preserved. They have helped Canada make a difference
internationally, and changed for the good the lives of
countless people around the globe.

###### A NEW INTERNATIONAL SECURITY CONTEXT

These statements still ring true today, whether in Southwest
Asia, Africa or the Middle East. The Government
believes that our military has an important role to play
internationally. The security of Canadians will continue
to depend on our ability to address threats both in
Canada and at their source overseas.

This is especially true with respect to failed and failing
states. By helping stabilize these countries, we prevent
threats from spreading further and deny terrorist cells
the haven and support that sustain them. In turn, this
helps reduce the prospect that terrorists will reach our
shores and threaten Canadians directly. At the same
time, Canadians are a compassionate people, and even
when our own interests may not be directly at stake, we
believe in helping those less fortunate than ourselves.
This concern for others is one of the fundamental
values that helps define our country.

Robust, combat-capable military forces are indispensable
if Canada wishes to fulfill these roles. While diplomacy
remains the preferred tool in the pursuit of international
peace and security, our country must possess the hard
military assets necessary to achieve our foreign policy
goals. This includes using lethal force when necessary.
In fact, as the Afghan experience has shown, military
power, diplomacy and development are intimately
linked and complement one another.

###### International Organizations

Multilateral cooperation is the foundation for a stable
and peaceful international system. Our country has


stood by this principle for more than five decades, and
we have been at the forefront of efforts to establish and
strengthen multinational institutions. Today, there is a
compelling need for greater international security
cooperation. The nature and complexity of the threats
facing us, from failed states to terrorism, require a
coordinated approach and a level of resources that could
never be achieved by governments acting on their own.

The Canadian Forces will, therefore, maintain their
contributions to international institutions such as the
United Nations and the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization. Membership in both of these organizations
continues to serve Canadian interests and reflect our
values. At the same time, consistent with international
legal norms, when the will of the international
community is clear, we will also consider participating in
less formal coalitions of like-minded states, as we have
seen in the international campaign against terrorism.

###### The United Nations

The Government believes that the UN continues to
have an important role to play in peace support
operations, particularly for the legitimacy that it confers
on these missions. In recent years, the UN has taken
several steps to improve its ability to undertake peace
support operations quickly and effectively. The 2000
Brahimi Report on UN Peace Operations
recommended that the world body put greater
emphasis on rapid deployment, conflict prevention,
peacebuilding strategies, and the role of civilians and
police. Solid progress has been made in carrying out
the Report’s recommendations; Canada will continue to
call for their full implementation.

Similarly, the Government has made clear that it
intends to engage members of the United Nations in
moving forward with the “Responsibility to Protect”
initiative, as endorsed by the December 2004 UN
Secretary-General High Level Panel Report. The
objective will be to develop new rules to enable the
international community to protect civilians from
extreme harm when their own government is unwilling
or unable to do so. National Defence will support the
Government’s efforts in this area.

The Government will continue to strongly support
other aspects of the UN reform agenda, including the

proposals put forward by Secretary-General
Kofi Annan in his March 2005 Report entitled
_In Larger Freedom: Towards Development,_
_Security and Human Rights for All._

Finally, Canada will take a lead role in the
Multinational Standby High Readiness
Brigade for United Nations Operations
(SHIRBRIG). The brigade, deployed for the
first time in Ethiopia and Eritrea in 2000, will
remain critical to the United Nations’ ability
to undertake peace support operations in the
coming years. Canada held the SHIRBRIG
presidency in 2003, and has command of the
brigade until mid-2006.

###### The North Atlantic Treaty Organization


#### AND MORE SECURE WORLD

**Kabul, Afghanistan—A doctor at the Chardehi Poly Medical Clinic with a Canadian**
Forces sergeant.


NATO is an essential collective defence structure and
embodies the transatlantic link that continues to be
critical to the security of our country. It remains a
strong political institution where allies with shared
values and interests can address issues that threaten
regional and international stability. Over the past
decade, the Alliance has moved steadily away from its
Cold War roots to stay relevant in the emerging security
environment. It has welcomed 10 new members from
eastern and central Europe since 1999, and has also
reached out to other partner countries in eastern
Europe, central Asia and the Mediterranean. It has
shown that it is a key regional organization with the
will and capabilities to contribute in a concrete fashion
to international security. NATO has played a leadership
role in stabilization operations in the Balkans and
undertook the first offensive operations in its history to
halt ethnic cleansing in that region.

The Alliance is also front and centre in the fight against
terrorism. In the immediate aftermath of September 11,
NATO invoked the collective defence article of the
Washington Treaty and dispatched airborne earlywarning aircraft to help monitor U.S. airspace. Since
then, at the urging of Germany and Canada, it has
conducted operations outside of its traditional area of
responsibility by taking command of the International
Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan. We will
continue to encourage NATO to make similar
contributions to global security.


NATO is currently in the midst of an ambitious
transformation process to ensure that it possesses the
modern forces needed to operate in the future security
environment. The Prague Capabilities Commitment is
a key part of this process, and Alliance countries have
pledged to improve their collective capabilities to
defend against attacks involving weapons of mass
destruction, maintain effective command and control
structures, remain interoperable and combat-effective,
and rapidly deploy and sustain forces. We fully support
this initiative, and will meet our national commitments
under it, which include helping to develop
multinational solutions for strategic sea and air lift.

Another key aspect of Alliance transformation is the
creation of the NATO Response Force, the goal of which
is to provide the organization with a global power
projection capability to manage crises and respond to
threats. An initial force of approximately 8,000 troops
was formed in 2003, which will serve as the prototype for
the complete force of approximately 20,000 personnel,
made up of sea, land and air components. The
Government believes that the NATO Response Force is
critical to the continued relevance of the Alliance. We are
negotiating our specific commitments, which we
anticipate will include a combination of sea, land and air
elements, as well as specialized training facilities.

In the interim, Canada will maintain other specific
commitments to the Alliance, including personnel
serving in the Airborne Early Warning Force and


-----

#### AND MORE SECURE WORLD

various allied headquarters. In addition,
we will continue to encourage Alliance
members and other countries to conduct
training in Canada, including in Goose
Bay and as part of the NATO Flying
Training in Canada program.

###### The European Union

Over the past 10 years, the European
Union (EU) has made great strides in
developing its own security and defence
identity. Canada believes that the

role in enhancing international peace
and security. The EU has already shown

operation, particularly when warlords, criminal gangs
and other irregular combatants remain part of the
equation. They call for a wide variety of tools, from
negotiation, compromise and cultural sensitivity to
precision weapons. The aim is always to produce
focused effects that put a premium, even in conflict
situations, on the sanctity of human life. Consequently,
the Canadian Forces will seek to maintain the right mix
of military capability to ensure that they can carry out
all potential aspects of a three-block war. They will
remain, above all, combat-capable in order to deter
aggression, defend themselves and civilian populations
against conventional and asymmetric attacks, and fight
and defeat opposing forces with the ultimate goal of
restoring peace and stability. The Canadian Forces have
shown themselves to excel in this area, which is one of
the reasons why they are in such high demand overseas.
They will improve even further.

Sending our men and women in uniform into these
dangerous situations is one of the most difficult
decisions of government. While demand for our
military to participate in international operations will
undoubtedly remain high, the Government will be
selective and strategic when considering such
deployments. As in the past, we will need to look at a
variety of factors before reaching a final decision,
including whether:

- the mission supports Canada’s foreign policy
objectives;

- the mandate is realistic, clear and enforceable;

- international political and financial
support as well as other resources are
sufficient to achieve the desired end;

- the proposed forces are adequate and
appropriate for the mandate;

- an effective process of consultation
between mission partners is in place;

- there is a clear exit strategy or desired
end-state;

 - there is a defined concept of operations, an effective
command and control structure and clear rules of
engagement; and

 - the mission does not jeopardize other Canadian
Forces commitments.

###### Military training assistance

In addition to making direct operational contributions
overseas, the Canadian Forces will play a more active
role in providing military training to foreign armed
forces. Fostering the development of democratic and
accountable militaries in nations emerging from conflict
promotes stability, helps prevent new crises, and
facilitates the withdrawal of international forces from
areas of conflict. By “training the trainers,” the
Canadian Forces can also assist other countries in
building their capacity to undertake peace support
operations. This, in turn, increases the quantity and
quality of troops available to the United Nations and
other organizations, and lessens the operational burden
on countries like Canada.

Our military’s expertise in this area is widely recognized
and sought after, as its role in helping train the Sierra
Leonean and Afghan armed forces demonstrated. We
will build on this success. For example, the Department
of National Defence will provide more resources to its
Military Training Assistance Program to carry out a
wide range of activities around the world, with
emphasis on Africa and the G8’s Action Plan for
Expanding Global Capability for Peace Support


-----

#### AND MORE SECURE WORLD

Operations. The Canadian Forces will focus their
efforts on developing basic staff skills to help midlevel officers conduct peace support operations.
Canada will also use the Canadian Forces’ bilingual
expertise to help Anglophone African militaries
operate in French-speaking regions of the continent,
and Francophone militaries to do the same in Englishspeaking regions. Finally, National Defence will
promote security sector reform to encourage
democratic values within armed forces.

These training activities will be broadened to include
maritime, air, land and special operations forces.
Maritime forces will offer their expertise in off-shore
patrolling and interdiction operations. Land forces will
provide peace support training. Our air forces will help
foreign militaries develop better air support to their
naval and land forces and improve air interdiction and
transport operations. Finally, our special operations
forces will provide training in counterterrorism
operations. As the Canadian Forces carry out these
activities, they will seek to gain access to special training
environments, such as jungles or deserts in Latin
America and Africa. They will also identify
opportunities for potential staging bases in support of
future missions.


###### Defence diplomacy and forward presence

Defence diplomacy will remain an important part of
National Defence’s efforts to contribute to international
stability. Bilateral and multilateral contacts, including
staff talks, ship and aircraft visits, and participation in
exercises are important elements of Canada’s foreign
policy. They help Canada understand the security issues
at stake in regions throughout the world while
enhancing democracy and civilian control and
accountability within other armed forces. The Canadian
Forces will continue these activities, in cooperation with
Foreign Affairs, in such regions as Africa, Latin
America, the Caribbean and Asia Pacific.

Defence diplomacy can also assist in the conduct of
Canadian Forces operations overseas. For example, the
relationships Canada forged with some Middle Eastern
countries after 2001 continue to help us in supporting
our efforts in Afghanistan. Canada will develop this
strategy further with selected countries, particularly in
Asia. The Canadian Forces will also consider
expanding their international “footprint”—for example,
through the placement of additional military personnel
in allied headquarters.


###### THE CANADIAN FORCES AND INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS

The Canadian Forces must remain capable of participating in a wide range of operations overseas, particularly when
dealing with the complex, fluid and dangerous environment of failed and failing states. These will include:

- **combat operations, such as those conducted during the Kosovo air campaign and with the United States in**
Afghanistan;

- **complex peace support and stabilization missions, such as those carried out with NATO in Bosnia and with the**
International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan;

- **maritime interdiction operations, such as those conducted in the Persian Gulf after the first Gulf War, and as part**
of the campaign against terrorism;

- traditional peacekeeping and observer operations, such as those carried out by the UN in the Middle East for
many years, and, more recently in Ethiopia/Eritrea;

- **humanitarian assistance missions, such as those conducted by the Disaster Assistance Response Team in**
Honduras, Turkey and, more recently, Sri Lanka; and

- **evacuation operations to assist Canadians in countries threatened by imminent conflict and turmoil, as we have**
done in Haiti.

In the new security environment, the Canadian Forces could find themselves in situations where they are conducting
several of these operations simultaneously in one theatre.


-----

###### Arms control

The Canadian Forces will participate in the
Government’s efforts to prevent the
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction,
including through the Proliferation Security
Initiative. This global effort, initiated by the
United States in 2003, is aimed at stopping
shipments of weapons of mass destruction, as
well as their delivery systems and related
materials, between state and non-state actors
of concern. It employs a variety of
instruments, including intelligence sharing
and maritime interdiction operations. Canada
became a full-fledged member in 2004. The
Canadian Forces will explore specific ways in
which they can contribute to international
operations conducted as part of this initiative.
They will also continue to carry out
conventional weapons inspections and
verification measures.

###### FUTURE TASKS OF THE CANADIAN FORCES

To support Canada’s role in contributing to
international peace and stability, the Canadian
Forces, with the addition of 5,000 Regular and
3,000 Reserve personnel, will be able to sustain
the continuous deployment of up to 5,000
personnel around the globe.

and will be used as an integral element of
the Standing Contingency Task Force or in
support of other national objectives; and

  - deploy a second task group for up to six
months, either as a follow-on force to the
Standing Contingency Task Force or as
part of a separate Mission-Specific Task
Force.

The Air Forces will be able to:



- provide assured airlift to support
international operations;

- provide a globally deployable special
operations aviation capability to the Special
Operations Group;

      - up to six medium-to heavy-lift helicopters to
support land operations;



- sustain indefinitely the deployment overseas of two
embarked maritime patrol helicopters (one on each
coast) and one Aurora maritime patrol aircraft as
the forward element of the Standing Contingency
Task Force anywhere in the world;

- provide for up to six months an Air Expeditionary
Unit as an integral element of the Standing
Contingency Task Force. This unit would be
comprised of:

  - up to two Aurora maritime patrol aircraft to
support land- and sea-based elements,

  - up to six maritime helicopters for deployment
with the naval task group, and



- sustain indefinitely overseas an Air Expeditionary
Unit as an integral element of a deployed MissionSpecific Task Force. This would consist of:

  - up to six medium-to heavy-lift helicopters to
support land operations;

- deploy for up to six months to a prepared base in a
secure location an Air Expeditionary Unit as an
integral element of a Mission-Specific Task Force.
This would consist of:

  - one Airbus configured for air-to-air refueling,
and

  - six CF-18 aircraft for air-to-ground missions.

The Land Forces will be able to:

- provide light forces to support the Special
Operations Group, capable of integrating
with Joint Task Force 2 elements;

- provide the land component of the Standing
Contingency Task Force, capable of
embarking and operating from a maritime
platform;

- sustain overseas for an indefinite period two
land task forces, potentially in different
theatres of operations, to form the land
component of Mission-Specific Task Forces.
While currently limited to approximately
700 personnel, these land task forces will
increase to approximately 1,200 personnel. In
addition, the land forces will be able to
provide a smaller, third task force of
approximately 1,000 personnel for a sixmonth period, either to reinforce a current
operation or to mount a new short-term
mission. Overall, the land forces will
effectively double their capacity to undertake
and sustain operations; and

- provide a brigade headquarters, capable of
commanding a multinational formation for a
year, as part of a larger Canadian
international effort.

In the area of humanitarian support and disaster
_relief, the Canadian Forces will, among other_
things:

- provide an enhanced Disaster Assistance
Response Team, or its component parts, for
humanitarian assistance missions overseas.

he Canadian Forces are a vital national
institution. Throughout Canada’s history, in
both war and peace, our men and women in

# T

uniform have made a difference—protecting our people
and territory, defending our interests and values, and
assisting others in need around the world. They have
performed these missions while accepting without
hesitation the principle of “unlimited liability” and all
that entails. They have formed an important part of our
national character, helping make us who we are as a
people. Our identity, prestige and influence
internationally have always been linked to the strength
and viability of our military.

In today’s security environment, where unpredictability
has become the dominant theme, the Canadian Forces
have a critical role to play, along with other government
departments and agencies, in protecting Canadians. To
fulfill this role, they must be effective, relevant and
responsive, with the ability to address threats both at
home and overseas—whether in the remote regions of
our North or in failed states half a world away.

This document has set out a new vision for the
Canadian Forces in the 21st century. It calls for a
transformed military, with the right capabilities, the
right equipment and technologies, and the right
command and operational structures and leadership to
perform effectively in demanding operations. It will be
a fully integrated force, capable of bringing to bear all
its resources to produce focused and precise results.

The success of Canada’s military will ultimately
depend, as it has in the past, on its people—their
professionalism, their skill and their training. At home,
they will need to be more vigilant and more innovative
than ever in defending our citizens and territory against
new and emerging threats, while continuing to perform
such essential missions as search and rescue and disaster
relief. They will rise to this challenge.

Overseas, recent experience in such places as
Afghanistan, Bosnia and Haiti has taught us that our
military personnel will be called upon to perform
wide-ranging tasks, from delivering humanitarian
assistance, to separating warring factions, to
establishing the conditions—even in the midst of
conflict—for the rule of law, democracy and
prosperity to take root. To operate in these dangerous


missions, the Forces must first be combat-capable.
Only then will they be able to call on their other skills,
including the ability to work with local populations.
This ability, which inspires and encourages locals to
take a direct stake in establishing their own security
and stability, makes the Canadian Forces a valuable
and much-in-demand commodity overseas.

In performing such roles, Canada’s military will be
defending our interests and promoting our values. It
will also be reflecting and helping build our national
character, just as it did in previous conflicts of a
different nature. And just as our military did in the
past, the Canadian Forces will strengthen our
reputation as a country that is committed to finding
enduring solutions to global problems.

This defence policy is designed for Canada, for
Canadians, and for the men and women of National
Defence, both military and civilian. The Government
has made major investments in the Canadian Forces,
both in terms of people and equipment, to ensure that
this policy can be implemented and that the institution
can meet the threats of the coming century. By doing so,
Canada will also enhance its credibility in the eyes of
friends and allies who share the same principles and
objectives in pursuit of a better world.

Our military has a long and proud tradition of
excellence. This policy will allow the Canadian Forces
to continue that tradition. Canadians, and their armed
forces, deserve nothing less.
