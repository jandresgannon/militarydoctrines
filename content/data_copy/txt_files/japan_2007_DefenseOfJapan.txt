###### Foreword

**Fumio Kyuma**

Minister of State for Defense

The transition of the Defense Agency to a ministry, which had been a long-term concern, was approved by a
majority of Diet members, and the Ministry of Defense was set up on January 9, 2007.

Since the foundation of the Defense Agency and the Self Defense Forces (SDF) more than 52 years ago,
the security environment surrounding Japan has undergone many significant changes. Accordingly, urgent
improvements in regard to the structure of the Defense Agency and the SDF became necessary so that the two
organizational entities could more promptly respond to a variety of problems and accurately but flexibly meet
the requests and expectations of the public. To meet these challenges, the Agency has made transition to the
Ministry of Defense.

The Ministry of Defense, to meet the expectations and trust of people, will plan and formulate a variety of
policies to fulfill its responsibility as the ministry in charge of national defense, which is one of the central
government’s fundamental missions. We at the Ministry will further make vigilant efforts with a strong sense
of responsibility to respond to any possible emergencies in a prompt and appropriate manner.

The security environment surrounding Japan remains severe. North Korea’s test-launch last year of ballistic
missiles and its announcement that it conducted a nuclear test, for example, are of major concern. The
establishment of the Ministry of Defense marks a fresh start for Japan toward the achievement of new policy
goals. The Ministry of Defense will more actively implement diverse measures, including those regarding the
realignment of the United States Forces in Japan (USFJ) and international peace cooperation activities.

First, we must implement the Japan-U.S. agreement on the realignment of the USFJ. It is extremely
important to implement the realignment in a smooth and prompt manner to enhance the effectiveness of the
Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements and decrease the burden that the U.S. military bases in Japan impose on
local communities. At the last session of the Diet, a bill to promote smooth realignment has passed. Through
implementation of the measures provided for in the law, we will steadily press ahead with the realignment.

International peace cooperation activities conducted by the SDF are highly appreciated by countries
throughout the world. These activities include those in the Indian Ocean conducted under the Anti-Terrorism
Special Measures Law as well as those being conducted in Iraq under the Humanitarian Relief and Iraqi


-----

Reconstruction Special Measures Law. The SDF will continue to proactively engage in international peace
cooperation activities, which were upgraded to one of its primary missions. In addition, the SDF will continue
to improve aspects of its education and training as well as transportation and other systems.

The Ministry of Defense must successfully begin its rebirth as a policymaking organization. In order to
develop a strategic plan for the nation’s future, ensure Japan’s security, and fully meet the expectations of the
international community, the Ministry must strengthen its policymaking function. Within the present fiscal
year, we will reorganize its structure, enhance the policymaking function, and boost contact with local
communities.

As demonstrated by North Korea’s test launch of ballistic missiles in 2006 and Pyongyang’s announcement
of the same year that it had implemented a nuclear test, there is a range of problems affecting Japan’s security
and the peace and safety of the international community. In order to deal with these problems in an appropriate
manner, we will steadily improve the nation’s defense capabilities as required. In particular, in order to
intercept any possible ballistic missile attacks, we aim to deploy SM-3 equipped ships and Patriot PAC-3 units
at an early date.

Through these measures, the Ministry of Defense and the SDF will devote themselves to contributing to the
future of Japan and its people and to the peace and stability of the world.

_Defense of Japan 2007 is the Ministry of Defense’s first white paper. It clearly describes important matters_
related to Japan’s defense and SDF activities conducted both at home and abroad, including the transition of
the Defense Agency to a ministry, in order to deepen understanding both at home and overseas. In addition, the
white paper introduces the activities of SDF personnel who are fulfilling their missions with vigilance and a
strong sense of responsibility under severe conditions.

I hope that as many people as possible will read this white paper and go on to offer us their frank opinion.

###### Instructions by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at the Commemorative Ceremony for the Transition of the Defense Agency to the Ministry of Defense (January 9, 2007)

Nearly 55 years have passed since the San Francisco Treaty of Peace with Japan came into effect and Japan
recovered its sovereignty. Today, in the capacity of prime minister, I am proud to witness the establishment of
the Ministry of Defense as an organization to take charge of national defense—a mission indispensable for the
protection of national sovereignty. Commemorating this historical day, I would like to express some of my
ideas to all staff of the Ministry of Defense and personnel of the Self-Defense Forces (SDF).
In 1954, as Japan was making its first strong steps toward recovery after the devastation of World War II,
the National Safety Agency was reorganized into the Defense Agency, and the SDF was founded as a national
defense organization of a democratic country based on a concept entirely different from that which formed the
basis of the former Japanese military. Japan thus started literally from nothing in terms of its national defense.
National defense is one of the most basic functions a country needs to fulfill to protect the lives, welfare and
property of its citizens. Domestic and overseas situations, however, have long positioned the governmental
organization in charge of national defense not as a ministry but as an extra-ministerial bureau of the Prime
Minister’s office.
In the Cold War era, the severe confrontation between East and West substantially affected the domestic
politics of Japan. In that era, some even objected to the existence of the Defense Agency and SDF. Those at the
SDF, however, encouraged by the silent support and trust of many people, patiently and doggedly engaged
themselves in daily training, sometimes clenching their teeth and sometimes in tears, and fulfilled their duties
in disaster relief missions, while assisting the welfare of the Japanese people.
The end of the Cold War, however, dramatically changed the security environment surrounding Japan. It
was a time for Japan to squarely face the crises and fundamentally review the roles of its defense capabilities.
Since the outbreak of the Gulf Crisis in 1990, the SDF has been engaged in a range of overseas operations,
including peacekeeping operations (PKO). SDF personnel worked and sweated to protect the lives, welfare and
property of people, devoting themselves to overseas operations, disaster relief missions in large-scale disasters
that befell Japan, such as the Great Hanshin-Awaji Earthquake, and maritime security operations, including
operations to deal with an incident involving a suspicious boat off the coast of the Noto Peninsula. Many
Japanese citizens felt sympathy for and trust in SDF personnel who conducted these activities.
The law for the transition of the Defense Agency to the Ministry of Defense passed with the support of
more than 90% of the Diet members in both the Upper House and Lower House. This was made possible
because those concerned, including active and retired SDF personnel, made efforts to fulfill their high and
noble mission of national defense over many years.


-----

Ministry of Defense officials and SDF personnel are required to devote themselves to meeting the
expectations of people, heedless of danger. We, however, must not forget that since the launch of the SDF,
more than 1,700 SDF personnel lost their precious lives in the course of fulfilling their missions. I would like
to express my sincere and heartfelt condolences to the family of those who sacrificed their lives to fulfill the
high and noble mission for the nation and its people.
It is no exaggeration to say that our country is now at the dawn of a new age. I have repeatedly mentioned
that we must make a clean break with the post-war regime. In order to make Japan a “beautiful country,” we
must part with the dogma that the post-war regime will never change. We must pursue new goals and new
ideals for Japan in the 21st century and give specific form to them.
A young Charles de Gaulle wrote in his book, The Edge of the Sword, “When faced with the challenge of
events, the man of character has recourse to himself. His instinctive response is to leave his mark on action, to
take responsibility for it, to make it his own business.[... ]It is not that he wishes to turn a blind eye to orders, or
to sweep aside advice, but only that he is passionately anxious to exert his own will, to make up his mind.”
With a similar attitude, I am determined to devote myself to the creation of a beautiful country. As for the right
of collective self-defense, I will give first priority to national safety at all times, exploring what kind of
activities in specific situations could constitute the exercise of the right to collective self-defense which is
prohibited under the Constitution of Japan.
Following the revision of the Defense Agency Establishment Law, the Defense Agency was elevated to
Ministry status, to a governmental organization in charge of planning and formulating policies on national
defense and security. Also, the transition to a Ministry clearly shows Japan’s commitment to national defense
and to the peace of the international community. This marks a big stride in parting with the post-war regime
and creating a new country.
The enactment of the law for the transition of the Defense Agency to a Ministry demonstrated to those both
within and outside the country the maturity of Japan as a democratic state, its confidence in civilian control,
and the will of the nation and its people to play a responsible role for the peace and stability of the international
community.
At the Japan-Philippines summit meeting held the other day, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, President of the
Philippines, kindly welcomed the transition of the Defense Agency to the Ministry of Defense. I believe this
implies that the President expects Japan to play a more active role in the security of the East Asian region and
she has great confidence in the maturity of Japan’s civilian control of the SDF.
Even at this very moment, SDF personnel are carrying out their missions under difficult conditions in Iraq,
the Golan Heights, the Indian Ocean, on isolated islands, and at the bases and camps of the SDF.
I can see in my mind how each of them is fulfilling their duties. As supreme commander, my heart is
always with the SDF personnel. I am always proud of their activities and I expect them to go beyond the call of
duty.
Finally, I hope that SDF personnel will maintain their high discipline and morale to ensure the peace and
prosperity of Japan and make dedicated contributions for the future of this beautiful country and people and for
the fulfillment of their high and noble mission for the world peace and stability. These are my instructions to
you.

###### Summary of Defense of Japan 2007

#### More Reliable in Times of Crisis, A More Effective Force for World Peace

**Part I Security Environment Surrounding Japan**

**Overview**
The international community today is facing a range of problems, including those related to traditional
relationships between countries (e.g., rise of China and India), proliferation of weapons of mass destruction
(nuclear and missile issues of North Korea), and new threats such as terrorism (situations in Iraq and
Afghanistan).

**Chapter 1 Issues in the International Community**
Countries have been implementing countermeasures against terrorism, but terrorist activities continue to occur
around the world. Concerns about the transfer and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction are increasing,
and international efforts are being made to solve the problems, including the nuclear issue of Iran.
The security situation in Iraq remains dire, and new security measures were started in the country in
accordance with the new policies of the United States.

**Chapter 2 National Defense Policies of Countries**
The United States has been continuously reviewing its military posture. Also, the country aims to increase the
personnel of its Army and Marine Corps to expand its military capabilities and reduce the burdens imposed on
individual units.
In July 2006, North Korea test-fired ballistic missiles, and in October of the same year, it announced that it
had conducted a nuclear test. The series of actions taken by North Korea poses a serious threat to the peace and
stability of the international community, in particular to East Asia.
China continues to modernize its military capabilities and it is necessary to carefully analyze the influence.
It does not show detailed breakdowns of its national defense budget. Furthermore, China did not give a
satisfactory explanation for the anti-satellite weapons test that it conducted in January 2007. The country needs
to improve transparency in terms of its military capabilities. Also, attention should be paid to its maritime
activities.

**Part II The Basics of Japan’s Defense Policy**

**Chapter 1 The Basic Concepts on Japan’s Defense Policy**
Peace, security, and independence are not brought about merely by wishful thinking. They cannot be achieved
without a comprehensive approach—including various means, such as diplomatic approaches and cooperation
with allies, as well as the nation’s own defense efforts.
Japan has been making efforts on its own initiative to build a modest defense capability under the
Constitution, in accordance with the fundamental principles of maintaining an exclusively defense oriented
policy, and not becoming a military power that might pose a threat to other countries, while adhering to the
principle of civilian control of the military and observing the Three Non-Nuclear Principles, as well as firmly
maintaining the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements.


-----

**Chapter 2 The National Defense Program Guidelines and Build-Up of Defense Capability**
In December 2004, Japan formulated the National Defense Program Guidelines in and after Fiscal 2005
(hereinafter referred to as NDPG 2004) as a means of showing the country’s basic policy on national security,
the significance and roles of Japan’s defense capability, and the basic principles of the defense capabilities to
be built up in the future.
The NDPG has set two objectives for Japan’s security—to prevent any threat from directly reaching Japan,
and to improve the international security environment. In order to achieve the two objectives listed above, the
NDPG calls for the integrated combination of Japan’s own efforts, cooperation with alliance partners, and
cooperation with the international community.
In addition, Japan formulated the Mid-Term Defense Program for fiscal 2005-fiscal 2009 (hereinafter
referred to as MTDP) to realize the new defense capabilities envisaged under the NDPG. Based on the MTDP,
Japan has been building up its defense capability.
In fiscal 2007, Japan is set to strengthen its policy-devising function and build a new defense organization
aimed at responding to a new era. Moreover, Japan will try to build up its defense capabilities in a more
efficient manner by placing emphasis on responding to new threats and diverse contingencies, including
responding to attacks from terrorists, guerrillas and special operations units, as well as enhancing abilities to
counter missile attacks and gather intelligence, and warning and surveillance abilities.

**Chapter 3 Transition to a Ministry and Stipulation of International Peace Cooperation as a**
**Primary Mission**

The Ministry of Defense (MOD) must continue to abide by Japan’s basic defense principles even as it ensures
that its approaches and roles are at all times suited to a changing security environment.
The transition of the Defense Agency to a ministry, the stipulation of international peace cooperation and
other activities as primary missions, and the reorganization of the MOD, are all viewed as efforts in this
direction. The MOD is seeking through these steps to become an organization that can be more robust in crises
and that can contribute to world peace.
With the end of the Cold War marking a key turning point in the changes that have taken place in the
security environment, the missions and roles of the MOD and the Self-Defense Forces (SDF) have since
expanded to include responses to large-scale disasters inside and outside of Japan, and international peace
cooperation activities. The importance of defense has increased, and the nation’s expectations of the MOD and
the SDF have risen accordingly.
In order to bolster defense policy planning functions and reinforce the structure for dealing with emergency
situations, as well as to maintain a system for proactively striving for peace and stability in the international
community on Japan’s own initiative, the government in June 2006 submitted a bill to the Diet to upgrade the
Defense Agency to a Ministry and stipulate international peace cooperation and other activities as primary
missions. This bill passed in December 2006.
To adequately address the policy issues of a new age, the MOD and the SDF must regularly conduct
reviews to ensure that their organizations are suited to the times. To that end, the MOD carried out an
organizational restructuring just last fiscal year, and will be pursuing further restructuring this year.

**Part III Measures for Defense of Japan**

**Chapter 1 Operations of Self-Defense Forces for Defense of Japan, Disaster Relief and Civil**
**Protection**

As manifested in the National Defense Program Guidelines (NDPG), efforts have been made to better prepare
the Self-Defense Forces (SDF) for the defense of Japan through the improvement of its responses to situations,


-----

such as new threats, diverse contingencies, and full-scale invasion, and the framework for such responses has
also been developed.
In order to ensure the peace and safety of the nation and the people at times of armed attack, emergency
legislation has been established to coordinate the activities of the SDF and U.S. Armed Forces. Regarding the
operations of the SDF, a joint operation posture has been formed, and various efforts have been continuing for
the SDF to execute their tasks for various contingencies in a timely and effective manner.
The Ministry of Defense and the SDF have been preparing themselves with the ability to respond
adequately to new threats and diverse contingencies without delay, including the contingencies exemplified in
the NDPG: (1) responses to ballistic missile attacks, (2) responses to attacks by guerrillas and special operation
forces, (3) responses to aggression towards offshore islands, (4) warning and surveillance in sea areas and
airspace surrounding Japan, and responses to the violation of airspace and to armed special operations vessels,
and (5) responses to large-scale and special-type (nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological) disasters.
When North Korea launched ballistic missiles in July 2006, Japan’s response posture and information
collection capabilities were reinforced through close coordination with relevant institutions in Japan and
concerned nations, including the United States. In March 2007, the Patriot system PAC-3 was introduced, and
emergency response procedures were defined for operations. Thus, various efforts have been made to enable
effective response to attacks by ballistic missiles.
In the event of a full-scale invasion, the SDF shall respond effectively without delay by taking organic and
unified action together with the Ground Self-Defense Forces (GSDF), Maritime Self-Defense Forces (MSDF),
and Air Self-Defense Forces (ASDF). In such an eventuality, U.S. forces will support the operations
undertaken by the SDF, and conduct operations complementary to those of the SDF, possibly including
operations employing striking force.

**Chapter 2 Strengthening of the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements**
The Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements and the Japan-U.S. alliance based thereon are crucial for the defense of
Japan, the maintenance of peace and stability in the region, and the improvement of the international security
environment.
The USFJ act as deterrence preventing an armed attack against Japan, and play a vital role in helping both
Japan and the U.S. take bilateral actions immediately, as well as providing bases for reinforcements of U.S.
forces, in the event of an armed attack against Japan. Thus, the USFJ play an extremely important role in
ensuring the security of Japan.
In recent years, Japan and the United States have been engaged in consultations on the future of the JapanU.S. alliance, including force posture realignment, to develop the alliance in response to changes in the security
environment from time to time.
Based on the basic policy of maintaining a deterrent force and reduce burdens on local communities, these
Japan-U.S. consultations have been conducted in the following three stages: (1) Common Strategic Objectives
(the First Stage); (2) Roles, Missions, and Capabilities of Japan and the United States (the Second Stage); and
(3) Force Posture Realignment (the Third Stage). At the two-plus-two meeting held in May 2006, Japan and the
United States finalized the force posture realignment in a document titled the Japan-U.S. Roadmap for
Realignment Implementation. This document indicated the details for implementing the concrete initiatives.
To facilitate rapid and full implementation of these initiatives, the Government of Japan enacted the Special
Measures Law concerning Smooth Implementation of the Realignment of U.S. Forces in Japan in May 2007.
For example, the Law provides for the institutionalization of new grants and the establishment of special
operations for Japan Bank for International Cooperation.
In addition to the above, Japan has so far taken various measures concerning USFJ facilities and areas,


-----

enacted diverse laws to improve the reliability of the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements, and taken measures
concerning Japan-U.S. joint exercises, the mutual exchange of equipment and technology, and other issues.

**Chapter 3 Improvement of International Security Environment**
Japan’s security goals set forth under the National Defense Program Guidelines (NDPG) are: to improve the
international security environment, and to prevent any threats from reaching Japan, as well as to ensure the
defense of Japan.
Japan has pledged to undertake international peace cooperation activities proactively and on its own
initiative. Based on this idea, international peace cooperation activities have been upgraded to the primary
mission of the SDF.
Based on the Law Concerning Special Measures on Humanitarian and Reconstruction Assistance in Iraq,
Japan has engaged in humanitarian and reconstruction support activities in Iraq, as well as providing support to
the Middle Eastern nation via the Government’s Official Development Assistance (ODA). Last year, the
Government of Japan judged that the reconstruction stage in which quick support measures had been necessary
has basically been brought to completion in Muthanna Province, both on the rehabilitation and security fronts,
and thus has withdrawn GSDF troops from the province. Meanwhile, an ASDF squadron has still been
undertaking Iraqi aid operations aimed at the country’s reconstruction and stability, providing airlifting support
to United Nations and multilateral forces.
In order for Japan to contribute both proactively and on its own initiative to the global battle against
international terrorism, the Maritime Self-Defense Force (MSDF), based on the Anti-Terrorism Special
Measures Law, has been refueling naval vessels of the United States and other nations operating in the Indian
Ocean. Meanwhile, the Air Self-Defense Force (ASDF) has been also airlifting goods and supplies of the U.S.
military.
International peace cooperation activities being undertaken by Japan include continuous participation in the
United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) and peacekeeping operations under the United
Nations Political Mission in Nepal (UNMIN). All of these activities undertaken by Japan have won high
acclaim from various countries around the world.
Japan has been promoting security dialogue and defense exchanges, including bilateral and multilateral
defense exercises. As part of such efforts, the Japan-Australia Joint Declaration on Security Cooperation was
released in March this year. In April of the same year, Japan had its first defense policy dialogue with India.
Japan has been actively participating in various activities geared towards arms control and nonproliferation, including support of the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI).

**Chapter 4 Citizens of Japan, and the Ministry of Defense and the SDF**
No matter to what extent the equipment and system of the SDF are improved and modernized, they cannot be
operated without personnel. Equipment capability cannot be maximally derived without individual personnel.
Moreover, regardless of the enhancement in the level of individual personnel and strengthened Japan-U.S.
Security Arrangements, it is still necessary to meet preconditions. Without the understanding and cooperation
of the citizens of Japan, it will not be possible for the Ministry of Defense and the SDF to fulfill their missions.
A wide range of necessary measures are being implemented for the establishment of basis of human
resources, while supported by cooperation from local public organizations and other related organizations—
from recruitment, employment, and education and training of personnel to their retirement and outplacement.
In particular, in regard to new measures concerning personnel, various discussions are underway following the
setting up of the Investigative Commission on Drastic Reform Concerning the Human Resource Factors of
Defense Capability.


-----

Moreover, to efficiently acquire equipment and material, various approaches are being taken. Among such
approaches are the promotion of Comprehensive Acquisition Reform, and the strengthening of ties with the
private sector in the field of technical R&D.
In addition, the Ministry of Defense will make concerted efforts to prevent further information leakage
based on the recognition that it is essential for the national defense and security to keep confidentiality.
The Ministry of Defense and the SDF also carry out wide-ranging cooperative activities to support civilian
livelihoods, so as to contribute to the fostering of mutual trust with the local community and the wider public.
In addition, to ensure harmony between defense facilities and the surrounding communities, the Ministry of
Defense will appropriately review measures, such as projects to improve living environments, and also strive to
enhance new measures.
Most importantly, a Ministry of Defense and an SDF that do not have the support of the strong confidence
of the people cannot adequately fulfill their functions. The Ministry of Defense and the SDF reflect deeply on
the fact that incidents undermining the people’s confidence have occurred, and are determined to make every
effort to prevent the reoccurrence of such incidents in the future.

Overview

**1. General**
Last year and the first half of this year witnessed a variety of events and incidents noteworthy from the
perspective of peace and security of Japan and the international community. They include North Korea’s
ballistic missile launches and announcement of nuclear tests, and the declaration of a new Iraq policy by the
United States.
The most characteristic features of today’s security environment are increasing diversity and complexity of
threats and difficulty of accurately estimating emergence of such threats. This requires each country to develop
new approaches to them.
The proliferation of nuclear, biological, chemical and other weapons of mass destruction (WMD) as well as
ballistic missiles and other delivery means for these WMDs is recognized as one of the greatest threats to
security today. Efforts to counter the proliferation of WMDs have become a pressing issue for the international
community. The problems of North Korea’s nuclear weapons and missiles not only impact the security of
Japan seriously, but also have become an important issue for the international community from the perspective
of the non-proliferation of WMDs. Iran continues its uranium enrichment and this issue also remains
unresolved despite the pressure from international community through U.N. Security Council resolutions and
other means. Furthermore concerns have risen about the acquisition and use of WMDs by international terrorist
organizations that have no state or people to protect and therefore conventional deterrence are not effective.
The heightened threat posed by international terrorist organizations and other non-state actors is one of the
notable features of the world’s security environment in recent years. Non-state entities such as international
terrorist organizations against which conventional deterrence does not function effectively now possess, due to
the spread of globalization, means of attack and destructive power that were previously beyond their grasp. In
addition, many non-state entities, unlike conventional military forces, are believed to have scattered, networktype organizations with members of various nationalities and this makes it very difficult for states to combat
them effectively. This fact became clear with the 9/11 terrorist attacks that took place in the United States in
2001. The clash between Israel and Hizbollah last year demonstrated that the abilities of non-state entities
should not be underestimated.
Patient, long-term approaches have become necessary in addressing threats such as terrorism. Although
some success has been achieved in the fight against terror by the United States and other countries, efforts
continue to address severe challenges presented in Iraq and Afghanistan, which are regarded by the United
States as front lines in this fight. An intensification of the sectarian conflict in Iraq since last year has caused a
serious deterioration in the security situation. Consequently, the United States announced a review of its Iraq
strategy in January and dispatched additional U.S. forces. With the resurgence of Taliban in Afghanistan,
efforts are being made to reinforce the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF). Therefore a
considerable number of troops must still be stationed in both countries, creating a crunch in troops deployable
overseas by major countries and impacting the world’s security environment in various ways.
Furthermore, relations between sovereign states remain a factor that cannot be overlooked in today’s
security environment. The emergence of China and India and the resurgence of Russia should be regarded as
major opportunities for international collaboration and cooperation. Simultaneously, interest has risen in their
policies, their mutual interaction, and their relations with other countries since any moves by these powers may
have a significant impact on the security environment.
As seen above, today’s international community confronts a range of issues from traditional inter-state
relations to new threats and diverse circumstances. These issues may arise simultaneously or in combination. It
has become difficult for any country, including the sole superpower, the United States, to address these


-----

complex issues on its own. Therefore, cooperation with allies and friendly countries has become necessary, and
so do more active measures to prevent the emergence of threats and comprehensive approaches that include not
only military means but also diplomatic, judicial, police, information, economic and other measures. The roles
required for military forces have also diversified beyond deterrence and armed conflicts to include a broad
spectrum of tasks from conflict prevention to reconstruction assistance. Accordingly, each state continues to
enhance its military capabilities in line with its resources and circumstances, and pursue international
cooperation and partnerships in security areas.

**2. Security Environment in the Asia-Pacific Region**
The Asia-Pacific region, in which some countries such as China and India are enjoying rapid economic
development, is drawing heightened attention worldwide
and has seen enhanced coordination and cooperation
among countries, mainly in economic affairs. On the other
hand, this region boasts considerable political, economic,
ethnic, and religious diversity, and conflicts between
countries/regions remain despite the end of the Cold War.
Since views on security and threats differ by country,
major changes in the security environment, which are seen
in Europe following the end of the Cold War, have yet to
be found. In addition, long-standing issues of territorial
rights and reunification still plague the region.
On the Korean Peninsula, the Korean people have
been divided for more than half a century, and the face-off
continues between the military forces of North Korea and
the Republic of Korea. There are issues concerning

Prime Minister Abe at press conference during visit to South Korea Taiwan and the overlapping territorial claims on the
following North Korea’s nuclear test announcement
(Cabinet Public Relations Office) Spratly Islands. Japan also confronts unresolved territorial

disputes over the Northern Territories and Takeshima,
both of which are integral parts of Japanese territory.
Concerns over North Korea’s nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles have grown more serious. North
Korea launched ballistic missiles in July last year, and announced in October that it had conducted an
underground nuclear test. These actions are seen as clear threats to the peace and security not only of Japan but
also of the international community. The international community strongly condemned these actions and took
firm steps including U.N. Security Council resolutions. In February 2007 the Six-Party Talks adopted “Initial
Actions for the Implementation of the Joint Statement,” marking an important step toward denuclearization.
However, careful monitoring of the nuclear issue including North Korea’s reaction is necessary. The abduction
of Japanese citizens by North Korea also poses a major threat to the lives and security of the Japanese public,
and the solution of this problem requires more sincere actions by North Korea.
Moreover, many countries in this region have taken advantage of economic growth to expand and upgrade
their military forces by increasing their defense budgets and introducing new weapon systems. In particular,
China, a regional power with tremendous political and economic influence, has been continuously boosting its
defense spending and has been modernizing its military forces. Consequently, China has drawn international
attention. There are also concerns about the lack of transparency regarding China’s military capabilities. When
China destroyed one of its own satellites in a test in January this year, the absence of a sufficient explanation
by the Chinese government has aroused the concern of other countries, including Japan with regard to the

peaceful use of space and their own security. (See Fig. I-0-0-1)
In recent years, terrorism and piracy in Southeast Asia have been seriously affecting the region’s security.

Terrorist organizations and separatist/independence groups have reportedly conducted terrorist attacks in
Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand. The Malacca Straits and the Singapore Straits, important international
sea lanes of transportation, are suffering from frequent piracy incidents, and joint efforts are underway to
combat these threats.
In the Asia-Pacific region, where elements of opaqueness and uncertainty still exist as described above, the
presence of the U.S. military remains extremely important. Japan and other countries have established bilateral
alliances and friendly relations with the U.S. and, accordingly, they allowed the stationing or presence of U.S.
forces in their territories.
Recent years have also seen an increase in opportunities for bilateral defense exchanges between countries

in the region. Efforts continue to take root in order to promote multilateral security dialogues, including the
ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) and conferences hosted by non-governmental institutions with the
participation of relevant defense ministers. Promoting and developing such confidence-building measures
among countries, alongside a stable U.S. military presence, is important to ensure security in the region.

Section 1. International Terrorism

**1. Overview**
The 9/11 attacks that took place six years ago prompted the entire world to reaffirm the threat of international
terrorism, and became the spark that ignited the current fight against terrorism by the United States and other
countries.
In the invasion of Afghanistan launched by U.S. and U.K. forces shortly after the 9/11 attacks, many of the
leaders of Al Qaeda, who had directed the 9/11 attacks, and the Taliban, who had harbored Al Qaeda, were
killed or captured. However, Osama bin Laden, Mullah Mohammed Omar and remnants of their respective
organizations are believed still to be hiding in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region[1], and the U.S.-led
multinational forces, the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF)[2], the Afghan military, and the
Pakistani military are engaged in clearing operations.
Countries have banded together in an international coalition, committing not only military forces but also
diplomatic, law enforcement, judicial, intelligence and economic resources, but there has been no halt on acts
of terrorism and terrorist plots around the world. In August 2006, for example, the U.K.’s authorities disrupted
an extensive terrorist plot to blow up several in-flight passenger airplanes bound for the United States from the
United Kingdom. It is reported that this attempted terror plot was possibly backed by the existence of a
criminal group spanning the United Kingdom and Pakistan and Al Qaeda’s involvement.
International terrorist organizations have recently been organizing cells in a more decentralized fashion,
while local terrorist organizations and individuals sympathetic to their ideology have been carrying out terrorist
activities on their own or in concert with these international terrorist organizations. Police investigations have
revealed, for example, that the July 2005 subway and bus suicide bomb attacks in London (U.K.) were not
carried out by foreign terrorists, but rather by the sons of Muslim immigrants born and raised in the U.K.[3] The
suicide bomb attack against a U.S. military convoy near Baghdad, Iraq, in November 2005 was also discovered
to have been carried out by the Belgian wife of a Middle Eastern man.
In light of the present situation, many countries in Europe and elsewhere have enacted stronger
counterterrorism measures, including domestic counterterrorism laws, since the London subway and bus bomb
attacks. Among the harsher steps taken by the Russian government, for instance, was the passage of a revised
Counterterrorism Law in March 2006 that authorized the downing or sinking of a passenger aircraft or ship
hijacked by a terrorist organization and posing the danger of loss of life or a large-scale disaster[4].
Counterterrorism measures are also being implemented through multinational frameworks such as the
United Nations, the G8, and regional cooperation organizations. These efforts include ensuring stability and
supplying recovery/reconstruction assistance to Afghanistan and Iraq, enhancing systems for exchanging
counterterrorism intelligence, reinforcing international legal frameworks to sternly punish terrorists, cutting off
terrorist funding and strengthening air security (including the prevention of hijacking), tightening immigration
controls, adopting more effective approaches to ensure the nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction,
assisting countries with inadequate counterterrorism measures to enhance their capabilities, and taking steps to
reduce or eliminate poverty, economic and social disparities and unfairness in developing countries.

**2. Fight against Terrorism in and around Afghanistan**
The United States together with other countries has continued military operations against the Taliban and Al
Qaeda in and around Afghanistan since October 2001, shortly after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. In the Arabian
Sea, naval vessels from various countries have endeavored to keep these terrorists from escaping by sea and to
prevent the proliferation of terrorism from Afghanistan.


-----

Terrorist forces such as Taliban appear to be on the rebound since 2006, and the security situation in
Afghanistan remains unstable. As the presence of the U.S.-led multinational forces, the ISAF, the Afghan
military, and the police have been further strengthened in the southern and eastern areas adjacent to the border
with Pakistan, the number of suicide bombings and attacks mainly targeting these multinational forces have
correspondingly increased. There have been also scattered terrorist bomb attacks in Kabul, the capital of
Afghanistan, and in the northern and western areas, which were relatively stable and peaceful. These
circumstances impel the multinational forces and the ISAF to collaborate in large-scale military operations in
the southern and eastern areas of the country. The ISAF has set up five Regional Commands under the General
Headquarters in Kabul. There have 25 Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) under the Regional Commands
to maintain security and conduct reconstruction assistance activities in the whole of Afghanistan. Similar
activities are also continuing through the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA).
Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Kirgizstan, and Tajikistan, all located in Central Asia, declared their intent to
cooperate in the counter-terrorism operations conducted by the United States and its allies following the 9/11
terrorist attacks, and some of them have served as rear bases in the fight against terror by allowing the
stationing of United States and other troops[5]. These four countries are members of the Shanghai Cooperation
Organization (SCO). Within that framework, they are actively involved in activities including counterterrorism
exercises of the Regional Antiterrorist Structure (RATS) set up for joint efforts to fight against terrorism.

**3. Terrorist Attacks around the World**
Since Saddam Hussein’s regime was brought down by U.S. and U.K. military operations in 2003, it seems that
terrorists have been flowing into Iraq due to degraded security and insufficient border controls, and terrorist
attacks have taken place on almost a daily basis, targeting not only U.S. and other soldiers but also general
Iraqi citizens and foreign civilians. In June 2006, Abu Musab Al Zarkawi, the leader of “Al Qaeda in Iraq” was
killed in an air attack by multinational forces, but activities probably attributed to that organization have
continued. The activities of these terrorist organizations have become a major obstacle to rebuilding Iraq.
Terrorist attacks have also continued in countries near Iraq. In April 2006, a series of terrorist bomb
attacks, which targeted at a supermarket and other shops in Dahab in the southern part of Egypt’s Sinai
Peninsula, killed more than 20 persons. In November 2005 three Western hotels were bombed in Jordan’s
capital of Amman, killing more than 50 people.
Southeast Asia ranks alongside Iraq and its neighbors as an area subject to large-scale terrorist attacks.
Between 2002 and 2005, Indonesia suffered large-scale terrorist attacks[6]. In these terrorist incidents, the
involvement of Jemaah Islamiya (JI), a radical Muslim organization, is suspected. In addition to the arrests of
more than 300 JI activists since 2002, the police authorities have achieved a certain level of success against JI,
killing Azhari bin Husin, one of JI’s top leaders and an explosives expert, in November 2005. Since 2004,
southern Thailand has also witnessed frequent attacks
and bombing/arson incidents by radical Muslim
separatists against facilities such as military and the
police.
South Asia, too, has seen frequent large-scale
terrorist attacks. Terrorist bombings targeting multiple
trains in city of Mumbai on India’s western coast in
July 2006 killed more than 180 people. The Mumbai
police authorities have announced the results of their
investigation—that the attack was planned by the
intelligence organs of the Pakistani military and


-----

carried out by a Pakistan-based radical Muslim organization—but the Pakistani government has denied any
connection with this incident. In central Sri Lanka, an October 2006 suicide terrorist bomb attack against a
convey of buses carrying naval soldiers left more than 100 people dead, including civilian bystanders. The
involvement of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), a militant secessionist Tamil organization, in
this incident is suspected. (See Fig. I-1-1-1)

Section 2. Transfer and Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction

The transfer or proliferation of weapons of mass destruction or ballistic missiles carrying such weapons has
been regarded as a significant threat since the end of the Cold War. In recent years, there have been growing
fears that non-state actors, including terrorists, against whom traditional deterrence works less effectively, will
acquire and use weapons of mass destructions.

**1. Nuclear Weapons**
During the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union, the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 made
it clear that there was a risk of nuclear war between the United States and the Soviet Union. The Treaty on the
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)[7] of 1968 prohibited countries other than those that had conducted
nuclear tests in or before 1966[8] from having nuclear weapons, and required nuclear-armed countries to control
and reduce nuclear weapons through bilateral negotiations[9].
Under the NPT, signed by 190 countries, the United States, Russia, the United Kingdom, France, and
China are now permitted to have nuclear weapons. While some countries that had nuclear weapons abandoned
them and became signatories of this treaty[10], some countries still refuse to sign this treaty[11]. Thus, in addition to
the five countries permitted to have nuclear weapons, there are other countries that have declared the
development and possession of nuclear weapons. For example, North Korea announced it had conducted a
nuclear test in October 2006.

**2. Biological and Chemical Weapons**
It is easy to manufacture biological and chemical weapons at a relatively low cost. Because most of the
materials, equipment and technology that are needed to manufacture them can be used for both military and
civilian purposes, disguising them is easy. This makes biological and chemical weapons attractive to states or
terrorists who seek asymmetric means of attack[12].
Biological weapons have the following characteristics: 1) manufacturing is easy and inexpensive, 2) there
is usually an incubation period of a few days from exposure to onset, 3) their use is hard to detect, 4) even the
threat of use can create great psychological pressures, and 5) heavy casualties can be caused depending on
circumstances and the type of weapon[13].
As for chemical weapons, asphyxiants such as phosgene were known during World War I. In the Iran-Iraq
War, Iraq repeatedly used mustard gas as an erosion agent and tabun and sarin as nerve agents[14] against Iran. In
the late 1980s, Iraq used chemical weapons to suppress Iraqi Kurds[15]. Other chemical weapons include VX, a
highly toxic nerve agent, and easy-to-manage binary rounds[16].
North Korea (see Chapter 2, Section 2) is one country seeking such weapons. The Tokyo subway sarin
attack that took place in Japan in 1995, and mail in the United States containing anthrax bacillus in 2001 and
ricin in February 2004, respectively showed that the threat of the use of weapons of mass destruction by
terrorists is real and that these weapons could cause serious damage in cities if terrorists use them. Since
January 2007, Iraq has seen terrorist bomb attacks using chlorine gas, and containers of chlorine as well as
weapons caches have been uncovered by Iraqi security forces and multinational forces.

**3. Ballistic Missiles**
Ballistic missiles can carry heavy payloads over long distances and can be used as a means of projecting
weapons of mass destruction, such as nuclear, biological or chemical weapons. Once launched, a ballistic
missile makes a trajectory flight and falls at a steep angle at high speed. No states have completed full spectrum
deployment of an effective system of defense against ballistic missiles at this moment.


-----

If ballistic missiles are deployed in a region
where military confrontation is underway, the
conflict could intensify or expand. The deployment
of ballistic missiles could further exacerbate tension
in a region where armed antagonism exists, and
could destabilize that region. A country may use
ballistic missiles as a means of attacking or
threatening another country that is superior in terms
of conventional forces.
In addition to the threat of ballistic missiles,
attention is now increasingly being paid to the threat
of cruise missiles, because it is comparatively easy
for terrorists and other non-state entities to procure
them[17]. Although the speed of a cruise missile is slower than that of a ballistic missile, it is difficult to detect
once it is launched and in flight[18]. Because cruise missiles are smaller than ballistic missiles, a terrorist can hide
one in a ship and secretly approach a target. If a cruise missile carries a weapon of mass destruction, its threat
would be enormous.

**4. Growing Concerns about Transfer or Proliferation of WMDs**
Weapons that are purchased or developed by a country originally for its own defense purposes could be easily
exported or transferred if the country successfully manufactures these domestically. For example, certain states
that do not heed political risks are transferring weapons of mass destruction and related technologies to other
states that cannot afford to invest resources in conventional forces and intend to compensate for this with
weapons of mass destruction. These states that seek weapons of mass destruction do not hesitate to put their
land and people at risk. Because governance is poor in such countries, terrorist organizations are reported to be
active. Therefore, the chance of actual use of weapons of mass destruction may generally be high in these
cases.
In addition, since it is unlikely that such states can effectively manage the related technology and materials,
the high possibility that chemical or nuclear substances will be transferred or smuggled out from these states to
other countries is cause for concern. Even without this technology, there is the risk that a terrorist will use a
dirty bomb[19] as a means of attack simply by acquiring a radioactive substance.
All countries have come to share concerns about the acquisition and use of weapons of mass destruction by
terrorists and other non-state entities. Based on these concerns, the United Nations Security Council adopted
Resolution 1540 in April 2004, declaring that all states should adopt and enforce appropriate and effective laws
that prohibit non-state actors from developing, acquiring, manufacturing, possessing, transporting, transferring
or using weapons of mass destruction and the means of delivery thereof, as well as refrain from assisting such
non-state actors. The International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism was also
adopted by the U.N. General Assembly in April 2005.
Activities related to weapons of mass destruction were secretly pursued in some countries. Such activities
have come to light since 2002, revealing the fact that nuclear weapon technologies have been proliferated and
transferred. On the other hand, the international community’s uncompromising and decisive stance against the
transfer and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction has put enormous pressure on countries involved with
such weapons, leading some of them to accept inspection by international institutions or to abandon further
programs to develop weapons of mass destruction.


-----

During (then) U.S. Assistant Secretary of State James Kerry’s visit to North Korea in October 2002, the
United States announced that North Korea had admitted to the existence of a project to enrich uranium for use
in nuclear weapons, pointing out the possibility that North Korea was pursuing the development not only of
plutonium-based weapons but also uranium-based nuclear weapons.
It has become clear that Iran, too, has been engaged in uranium enrichment-related activities since 2002,
and efforts by the international community to resolve this issue continue.
As a result of behind-the-scenes discussions with the United States and the United Kingdom from March
2003, Libya announced in December 2003 that it would abandon all of its weapons of mass destruction
programs and accept immediate inspections by international organizations. Subsequently in August 2006, the
country ratified the additional IAEA protocol.
Pakistan seems to have launched its nuclear development program in the 1970s, and suspicious technology
transfers concerning uranium enrichment from Pakistan to Iran and Libya were revealed in 2003. In February
2004, it came to light that nuclear-related technologies, including uranium enrichment technology, have been
transferred to North Korea, Iran and Libya by Dr. A.Q. Khan and other scientists for personal gain. These
transfers have been shown to have been secretly conducted using global networks involving Europe, Africa, the
Middle East and Southeast Asia[20]. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director-General Mohammad
El Baradei has reportedly stated that this network spans more than 30 countries[21].
Further, ballistic missiles have significantly proliferated or been transferred. The former Soviet Union
exported Scud-Bs to many countries and regions, including Iraq, North Korea and Afghanistan. China and
North Korea also exported DF-3 (CSS-2) and Scud missiles, respectively. As a result, a considerable number of
countries now possess them. Pakistan’s Ghauri and Iran’s Shahab-3 missiles are said to be based on North
Korea’s No-Dong missile[22]. Libya, which agreed to abandon its weapons of mass destruction programs,
reportedly disclosed production lines for Scud-Cs and other facilities built with the technological assistance of
North Korea[23]. It has been reported that Ukraine illegally exported cruise missiles capable of being fitted with
nuclear warheads to Iran and China around 2001[24].

**5. Iran’s Nuclear Issue**
Since the 1970s Iran has been pursuing a nuclear power plant construction project with cooperation from
abroad, claiming that this plant was to be used for peaceful purposes in accordance with the NPT. In 2002,
however, it was announced by a group of dissidents that Iran was secretly constructing a large-scale uranium
enrichment facility, and subsequent IAEA inspection revealed that Iran had engaged in the enrichment of
uranium and other activities potentially leading to the development of nuclear weapons without notifying the
IAEA, in violation of the IAEA’s safeguards agreement. Since this revelation regarding Iran’s nuclear
program, Iran has insisted that it has no intent of developing nuclear weapons and that all of its nuclear
activities are for peaceful purposes. Nevertheless, the international community has expressed strong concerns
about obtaining assurances of Iran’s claims, and has demanded that Iran suspend all of its enrichment and
reprocessing activities until it can confirm that Iran’s nuclear development activities are solely for peaceful
purposes.
Exercising initiative to resolve the issue, the EU-3 (the United Kingdom, France and Germany) held
discussions with Iran in hopes of resolving this issue; an accord (Paris Accord) was reached in November 2004
on halting uranium enrichment and all other nuclear-related activities, and Iran accordingly ceased its nuclearrelated activities. However, Iran rejected as unsatisfactory the proposal[25] for a Long-Term Agreement presented
by the EU-3 in August 2005 and announced the start of preparations for the recommencement of uranium
enrichment in January 2006 (Iran recommenced uranium enrichment in February). The IAEA then convened an
emergency Board of Governors meeting in February 2006 that by a majority vote adopted a resolution to report


-----

the issue to the U.N. Security Council. In March
2006, the U.N. Security Council approved a
Presidential Statement calling on Iran to halt its
uranium enrichment and reprocessing activities, but
in April Iran announced that it had successfully
achieved low-grade (3.5%) uranium enrichment[26] and
stuck to its policy to continue uranium enrichmentrelated activities. In June 2006, a comprehensive
proposal was presented to Iran under an agreement of
the 5 permanent members of the U.N. Security
Council and Germany. The proposal included
cooperation in the event that Iran suspended all its
nuclear activities, including uranium enrichmentrelated activities; Iran nevertheless continued its nuclear activities. In view of Iran’s response, the U.N.
Security Council in July adopted Resolution 1696 demanding Iran to suspend all of its uranium enrichment and
reprocessing activities and warning that appropriate measures would be taken under Chapter 7, Article 41 of
the U.N. Charter if Iran were not to comply with this resolution by the end of August 2006.
Because Iran continued its uranium enrichment-related activities, the U.N. Security Council adopted
Resolution 1737[27] on December 23, 2006, and then Resolution 1747[28] on March 24, 2007, to impose stricter
sanctions in accordance with Chapter 7, Article 41 of the U.N. Charter. Despite these efforts by the
international community, Iran in April 2007 declared that its nuclear fuel production was in industrial scale.
Although the Iran’s nuclear issue remains unresolved, the U.N. Security Council and the rest of the
international community are continuing to pursue political and diplomatic solutions through negotiations.

**[COLUMN]**

**COMMENTARY**

**Nuclear Weapons and Nuclear Issues Surrounding North Korea and Iran**

Nuclear power is useful when used for peaceful purposes under the strict safeguards mechanism of the
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). However, since nuclear power can also be used to produce
nuclear weapons, the North Korean and Iranian nuclear issues are currently posing a serious threat to the
international society. This column explains the two key terms of the issues—nuclear weapons and
reactors.

**(1) Energy sources of nuclear weapons[1]: uranium and plutonium**
Nuclear weapons utilize gigantic energy released at the time of nuclear fission activated by neutron
absorption. Therefore the production of nuclear weapons requires, first and foremost, materials made up
of atoms that are easy to split (fissile materials). The two most typical fissile materials are uranium and
plutonium.
Natural uranium consists mainly of uranium-235, which is fissionable, and uranium-238, which is not.
Since uranium-235 makes up only 0.7% of natural uranium, the enrichment process is required to separate
uranium-235 from natural uranium before using it as a material of nuclear weapons. Uranium enrichment
generally necessitates a large-scale facility with several thousands of centrifuges linked with each other.
The concentration of uranium-235 can be increased to a weapons grade (90% or more) at such an
enrichment facility.


-----

Plutonium, on the other hand, seldom exists naturally, and is created artificially in reactors. Most of
the existing nuclear weapons are the plutonium type. In reactors, when uranium fuel is irradiated with
neutrons to cause nuclear fission of uranium-235 to generate energy, uranium-238 is also exposed to
neutrons and produce plutonium as a by-product. The spent fuel therefore contains uranium-235, uranium238 and plutonium in a mixed state, and has to be chemically processed at reprocessing plants to separate
plutonium from the other remnants. However, plutonium extracted from fuel used for power generation in
nuclear power reactors—often called “reactor grade plutonium”—has a high plutonium 240[2] content, and
is generally considered unsuitable for nuclear weapons.

**(2) Types of reactors, and nuclear suspicion about Iran and North Korea**
Reactors are divided into graphite moderated reactors (GMRs), heavy water reactors (HWRs) and light
water reactors (LWRs). GMRs and HWRs can use natural uranium as fuel, and are believed to be more
suitable for producing plutonium than LWRs. LWRs, on the other hand, use uranium-235 enriched to 3 to
5% (low-enriched uranium (LEU)). LEU can be produced domestically or imported from abroad, and in
the case of the former, it is important for other countries to determine whether the enrichment facility is
for peaceful or military use. Since LWRs need to be deactivated when their fuel is replaced, they are
believed to be easier than GMRs and HWRs to monitor the disposal of spent fuel containing plutonium.
Under the 1994 Agreed Framework, North Korea agreed to demolish its GMR on condition that,
among others, an LWR would be provided to the country in place of the GMR. The framework seemed to
put an end to the suspicion about North Korea developing plutonium-type nuclear weapons. However,
North Korea allegedly tried to import materials to produce centrifuges although the country was expected
to import LEU for the LWR. This has led other countries to suspect that North Korea may be developing,
this time, uranium-type nuclear weapons. (See Chapter 1, Section 2 (p.36))
Iran is trying to establish its own uranium enrichment technology, which the country claims is to be
used to produce LEU necessary for an LWR currently being constructed. However, since Iran had been
conducting various activities including uranium enrichment without reporting to the IAEA until 2002, the
country’s claim that its nuclear development is intended solely for peaceful purposes is regarded by the
international community as unconvincing, and is suspected to be developing nuclear weapons. Iran has
been continuing with uranium enrichment, defying Security Council resolutions several times, and the
IAEA reported in May this year that about 1,300 centrifuges are currently in operation in the country. In
addition, Iran has begun to construct a research HWR. Since it is not clear why an HWR is needed in
addition to the LWR, and HWRs are more suitable for producing plutonium than LWRs, it is also
suspected that the country may be developing plutonium-type nuclear weapons, causing concern to the
international community. (See Section 2 (p.14))

1) There are in fact two types of nuclear weapons: nuclear fission weapons and nuclear fusion weapons. But this column focuses only on the former.
2) Unlike plutonium 239, plutonium 240 is likely to fission spontaneously. Therefore, plutonium with a high plutonium 240 content is considered unable to
effectively produce nuclear explosions.

Section 3. Situation of Iraq

**1. Security Situation after the Establishment of New Iraqi Government**
Even after the establishment of a new Iraqi government in May 2006, the public security situation in Iraq is as
challenging as before. Attacks against multinational forces and Iraqi security units are common, particularly in
the “Sunni Triangle”[29] and parts of northern Iraq, and sectarian conflicts have been severe. Especially, the
February 2006 bombing of a Shiite mosque in Samarra in central Iraq triggered fierce sectarian violence,
resulting in a rapid increase in Iraqi civilian victims, particularly in Baghdad, and creating major problems for
the country’s security and stability.
In the backdrop to this violence are radical Islamists, who apparently are continuing terrorist attacks both to
create the impression in Iraq and abroad that the Iraqi government is unable to govern and the multinational
forces incapable of maintaining order, and to create political chaos by fueling sectarian and ethnic disputes.
This gives rise to a “chain of retaliation,” with sects that have been attacked calling on private militia
organizations to exact revenge.
Attacks against multinational forces, Iraqi security forces and civilians continue in Iraq, by a variety of
means such as improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices
(VBIEDs).
The influence of nearby countries has also been noted with regard to the security situation in Iraq. In
particular, it has been reported that Iran has been providing weapons and financial support to militia
organizations within Iraq, and that the remnant of supporters of the Hussein regime and Islamic radicals are
pouring into Iraq from Syria[30].

**2. Security and Other Measures by Iraqi Security Forces and Multinational Forces**

With the increasingly fierce sectarian rivalry
described above producing a deteriorating security
situation in Baghdad and elsewhere and becoming a
serious obstacle to political and economic progress,
President Bush implemented a review of the United
States’ Iraq policy. After discussions with the Iraqi
government, he announced a new strategy with
regard to Iraq in January 2007. Positing the
restoration of order in Baghdad as the key to success,
this new policy seeks to tackle head-on the issue of
ensuring the security of local residents, as opposed to
the focus of the previous policy on transferring the
responsibility for security to the Iraqis. As the strengthening of the Iraqi security forces’ capabilities, which is
the premise of the strategy, may not prove sufficient on its own, the United States decided to send more than
20,000 additional combat troops. The dispatch of an additional carrier strike group to the Middle East and the
deployment of Patriot air defense systems were among other steps taken to bolster the security of Iraq and
protect U.S. interests in the Middle East[31].
Iraqi Prime Minister Maliki then initiated a new security policy for Baghdad in February 2007 that called
for approximately 90,000 Iraqi security and U.S. forces to be dispatched to Baghdad to crack down on all
illegal behavior regardless of affiliation.
Transfers of responsibility for security from multinational forces to Iraqi authorities are proceeding in the
provinces in which the capabilities of Iraqi security forces have been enhanced and local conditions have


-----

improved. Thus far, authority for security has been transferred in seven provinces, including southeastern
Iraq’s Muthanna Province, in which the GSDF was engaged in humanitarian and reconstruction assistance
activities. (See Fig. I-1-3-1)

As of May 2007, military units from 26 countries, including approximately 150,000 U.S. troops, are

deployed within Iraq and are given responsibility for security and reconstruction assistance, but changing
circumstances have led to changes in the scale of some of the multinational forces. For instance, the United
Kingdom, citing progress in handing over the responsibility for security in southern Iraq, announced in
February 2007 that it would be reducing the British contingent in Iraq from 7,100 to about 5,500 within a few
months.
The basic idea underlying the activities of the multinational forces is that the presence of such forces is
necessary until Iraqi security forces are able to maintain security on their own. Consequently, the multinational
forces assert that they cannot set out in advance a deadline for terminating their activities, even while insisting
that their involvement in Iraq is not unlimited. They say that more time will be needed until the Iraqi security
forces are able to maintain order and stability in Iraq on their own.

**3. Efforts by the Iraqi Government and International Community toward Reconstruction**
Breakthroughs in the situation in Iraq will require not only security measures but also political efforts by the
Iraqi government on its own initiative to promote national reconciliation. Prime Minister Maliki in June 2006
devised a national reconciliation plan, and held a national reconciliation conference in Baghdad in December.
Thus Iraq is continuing efforts to build a democratic and stable state on the basis of national reconciliation.


-----

Many countries have contributed to Iraqi
reconstruction through the dispatch of troops and
bilateral and multilateral assistance programs. Since
2005, the United States and others have deployed
Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) made up of
military and civilian personnel to provide support to
local governments in Iraq, and the United States
decided in the previously mentioned new Iraq
strategy to double the number of PRTs in giving
greater emphasis to both military and non-military
cooperation. The United Nations has been
coordinating reconstruction, development and
humanitarian assistance through the United Nations
Assistance Mission for Iraq (UNAMI).
In the mean time, the Iraq Compact was launched in May 2007 by an international framework co-chaired
by the Iraqi government and the United Nations to build a new partnership between the Iraqi government and
the international community. In this Iraq Compact, the Iraqi government has presented its policy objectives for
the next five years in the areas of governance, security, and economic recovery, and the international
community has promised assistance for such efforts by the Iraqi government.

Section 4. Complex and Diverse Regional Conflicts

Complex and diverse regional conflicts are erupting around the world. The characteristics of regional conflicts
differ from one conflict to another, whether they be inter-state or intra-state conflicts. They may result from
various ethnic, religious, territorial or resource-related problems, and may range in form from armed conflict to
sustained armed antagonism. The resultant human rights violations, refugees, hunger, poverty and terrorism
have at times become international issues. For that reason, it has become more important for the international
community to determine the character of complex and diverse conflicts and seek out approaches appropriate to
their character, including approaches involving international frameworks. (See Fig. I-1-4-1)

The Middle East has witnessed four wars between Israel and Arab states or Palestinians since the
foundation of Israel in 1948. The Oslo Agreement concluded in 1993 marked the start of a peace process
through negotiations, but the Israelis and Palestinians subsequently suspended their negotiations due to the
intifada that started in 2000 and resulted in the exchange of violence between the two parties. In 2003, both the
Israelis and Palestinians accepted a “Road Map” that laid out a course leading to the establishment of a Middle
East peace initiative between the Israelis and the Palestinians on the principle of the peaceful coexistence of
two nations. However, the implementation of the Road Map has not yet been promoted. The Israelis would not
make any compromise regarding their own security and demands the Palestinians to disband terrorist groups.
Furthermore, the Israeli government takes a stern approach toward the Palestinians, saying that in the event that
they do not make appropriate responses, the government will no longer regard the Palestinians as its dialogue
partner and unilaterally build a barrier and draw _de facto borders. On the Palestinian side, the Islamic_
fundamentalist organization Hamas, which does not recognize Israel and which advocates a continuation of
armed conflict against Israel, won the Palestine Legislative Council elections of January 2006 and established a
Hamas-led administration in March 2006.


-----

In June 2006, following the capture of Israeli soldiers by Palestinian militants in Gaza, the Israeli military
invaded the Gaza area, from which it had withdrawn in 2005. After about five months of fighting, which
included air strikes by the Israeli military and rocket attacks by Palestinian armed groups, a ceasefire went into
effect between the Israelis and the Palestinians in Gaza in November 2006. Within the Palestinian ranks,
however, the rivalry between Fatah, a mainstream part of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), and
Hamas intensified, and clashes among Palestinians resulted in deaths and political chaos. To bring this dispute
to an end, an accord reached in Mecca in February 2007 led to the formation of a unified Palestinian
government by Fatah and Hamas in March. In May 2007, however, Fatah and Hamas clashed, Hamas attacked
the Israelis, and the Israeli military resumed its military operations. The situation thus does not allow premature
conclusions.
Israel has not yet signed peace treaties with Syria and Lebanon. There are different stances between Israel
and Syria on the returning of the Golan Heights that Israel occupied after the 1967 Arab-Israel War, and the
United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF), which observes the implementation of ceasefire and
disengagement between two nations, is deployed.
The July 2006 capture of Israeli soldiers by the Shiite Islamic organization Hezbollah near the border
between Israel and Lebanon was followed by air attacks against Lebanon and the insertion of ground troops by
Israel. Hezbollah declared a do-or-die resistance and launched rocket attacks against Israeli territory. Fierce
fighting continued for about a month between the Israeli military forces and Hezbollah, and both Israel and
Lebanon suffered major damage. Israeli air strikes on Qana in southern Lebanon that killed numerous children
and other civilians sparked more urgent efforts by the international community to bring about a cessation of
hostilities. The U.N. Security Council Resolution 1701 called for a cessation of aggression, and this ceasefire
went into effect on August 14. In line with this resolution, an expanded United Nations Interim Force in
Lebanon (UNIFIL) has been deployed alongside the Lebanese military in southern Lebanon to monitor the
ceasefire.
India and Pakistan gained their independence from the former British India after World War II, but three
large-scale armed conflicts have broken out between the two countries over Kashmir and other issues. (See
Chapter 2, Section 6)
On the Korean Peninsula, the Republic of Korea (ROK) and North Korea are confronting each other with
tension across the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), with a total of approximately 1.5 million ground forces; this
military confrontation has been ongoing since the end of the Korean War (1950–1953). (See Chapter 2, Section 2)
In Nepal, armed conflict with the Maoist faction of the Nepal Communist Party has caused a great number
of casualties since 1996. A democratization movement produced a new government in April 2006, and a
comprehensive peace agreement was signed in November between this government and the Maoists. Following
this agreement, the United Nations Political Mission in Nepal (UNMIN) has been deployed in accordance with
U.N. Security Council Resolution 1740, and among its duties are monitoring the status of weapons and
soldiers.
In Sudan, disputes over local autonomy and developmental disparities led in 2003 to intensified fighting
between the Arab government and the African anti-government forces (both Muslim) in Darfur region of
western Sudan. The Arab militia known as Janjaweed has continued attacks against local African residents,
creating large numbers of internally displaced persons and an outflow of refugees into neighboring Chad. The
United Nations and the rest of the international community have been treating the Darfur issue as a serious
humanitarian crisis. Recently it seems that this conflict is spilling over into Chad and the Central African
Republic, and showing signs of escalating into an international conflict. To settle the Darfur conflict, the
African Union (AU) has dispatched the African Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS) to mediate negotiations for
peace between the government and rebels. The government and the Sudan Liberation Movement/Army


-----

(SLM/A), one of the major rebel groups, signed the Darfur Peace Agreement (DPA) in May 2006, and efforts
are ongoing to persuade rebels who did not accept the DPA. On the other hand, the Sudanese government has
consistently remained noncommittal about (then) U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan’s November 2006
proposal on the African Union-United Nations hybrid operation of about 20,000 troops, the final stage of the
U.N.’s assistance program for AMIS.
Somalia had been in a state of anarchy since 1991, but in 2002, a peace process was promoted by the
Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) and in January 2005, the Transitional Federal
Government (TFG) was established in Nairobi and members of the TFG returned to Somalia in June 2005. Last
year, fighting intensified between the TFG and the Union of Islamic Courts (UIC), an Islamic fundamentalist
organization. In January 2007, the TFG forces and the Ethiopian military, which was deployed in Somalia in
response to the TFG’s request for support, brought under control the south central area including the capital of
Mogadishu. In February 2007, the U.N. Security Council adopted Resolution 1744 and based on this
resolution, the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) has been deployed. There were, however, armed
attacks against the TFG, Ethiopian military, and AMISOM, and the situation remains unclear.

Section 1. The United States

**1. Security and Defense Policies**
For a long time, the defense policy of the United States—a continental state shielded by two oceans—was
based on the assumption that war would not be fought on the country’s soil. However, the September 11, 2001
terrorist attacks in the United States (the 9/11 attacks) made the United States recognize that its geographic
advantage could not make its territory free from a direct attack. As a result, the Unites States has decided to
give top priority in its national security to homeland defense.
The National Security Strategy [1] released in
March 2006 states that the United States can protect
its nation by leading an effort of the international
community to end tyranny and promote democracy.
The United States, however, cannot achieve such
idealistic goals alone, and so the United States is
committed to taking a realistic approach that relies on
cooperation with allies, partners, and the international
community.
The Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) [2]

released in February 2006 states that the United
States is in a “long war” against the terrorist
networks and needs to reorient the capabilities of
U.S. forces to address the new security challenges on the basis of the lessons learned from the recent
operational experiences and to improve capabilities dealing with irregular, catastrophic, and disruptive
challenges (see 1 below) while sustaining capabilities to address traditional challenges.
Furthermore, the QDR repeatedly stresses that, as the Department of Defense cannot independently win the
“long war” that the United States faces today, it is essential to bear all elements of national power at home and
to work in close cooperation with allies and partners abroad.

**1. Assessment of Security Environment**
The United States considers that the security environment of today is different from that of the Cold War era in
that it is difficult to predict who, where, and when will pose threats to and attack the United States, while
during the Cold war the Soviet Union was clearly recognized as an enemy. The National Defense Strategy[3]

identifies four challenges that the United States is expected to face in today’s uncertain security environment:
1) Traditional challenges: Threats of military conflicts among nations employing conventional forces. Although
the United States takes advantage over other countries in this area, the possibility that enemies pose threats
to the United States cannot be ruled out.
2) Irregular challenges: Challenges employing such irregular methods as terrorism and insurgency to erode
U.S. influence, patience, and political will. Irregular challenges have been intensified by the rise of political,
ethnic, and religious extremism and the ineffective control over the territories, which creates sanctuaries for
terrorists, criminals, and insurgents in some countries.
3) Catastrophic challenges: Threats involving the acquisition, possession, and use of weapons of mass
destruction (WMD) or methods producing WMD-like effects. In case rogue states or transnational terrorists
seek to acquire WMD, the threat to the United States will particularly increase.
4) Disruptive challenges: Threats coming from adversaries who are seeking to exploit U.S. vulnerabilities by
means of breakthrough technologies to offset the current advantages of the United States. Some


-----

breakthroughs, including advances in biotechnology, cyber operations, and space weapons could endanger
the security of United States.

**2. Defense Strategy**
The United States outlines the strategic objectives in the security environment as follows: 1) securing the
United States from direct attack; 2) securing strategic access and retaining global freedom of action; 3)
strengthening alliances and partnerships; and 4) establishing favorable security conditions. In addition, the
National Defense Strategy describes the following four measures to accomplish these strategic objectives:
1) Assure allies and friends by fulfilling alliance and other defense commitments.
2) Dissuade potential enemies from adopting threatening capabilities, methods, and ambitions by sustaining
and developing the military advantage of the United States.
3) Deter aggression and coercion by maintaining capable and rapidly deployable military forces and, when
necessary, demonstrating the strong will to resolve conflicts.
4) Defeat adversaries by employing military power, as necessary, together with other instruments when
deterrence fails.
Furthermore, the National Defense Strategy shows the following four implementation guidelines to be
followed in pursuing the aforementioned strategic goals:
1) Active, layered defense: it is necessary to defeat challenges to the United States early and at a safe distance.
Therefore, preventive actions such as security cooperation, forward deterrence, and nonproliferation
initiatives are critical. As these actions cannot be implemented solely by the United States, cooperation with
allies and friends is essential. It is also necessary to improve the capabilities to defend homeland by
strengthening missile defense and other defensive measures.
2) Continuous transformation[4]: In order that the United States ensures its advantage, it is necessary to
continuously transform U.S. forces by changing long-standing business processes within the Department of
Defense and its relationship with interagency and international partners as well as methods of fight (concepts
of warfare, definition of threat, operation style, organization, and composition of weapons).
3) “Capabilities-based” approach: In current security environment, it is difficult to predict when and where
threats to the United States will emerge. However, it is possible to predict the capabilities that enemies will
employ to attack the United States. Therefore, the United States continues to adopt the “capabilities-based”
approach proposed in the QDR 2001 and focuses on what capabilities are needed to counter enemy
capabilities.
4) Managing risks: Based on the concept of risk management proposed in the QDR 2001, the United States
identifies various risks that many arise in pursuing the strategic objectives with limited resources, and
controls them properly[5].

**3. Priority Areas for Capability Development**
The QDR states that it is necessary to improve capabilities dealing with irregular, catastrophic, and disruptive
challenges while sustaining capabilities to address traditional challenges on the basis of the security
environment and the defense strategy described above. Specifically, it lists the following four priority areas for
capability development:
1) Defeating terrorist networks: In order to win the war on terror, it is necessary to deter the terrorist networks
from securing their sanctuaries by attacking them relentlessly. Therefore, in addition to developing
intelligence collection capabilities and special operation capabilities, U.S. forces strengthen their cooperation
with interagency partners and provide training to security forces of other countries. To defeat terrorist
networks in a battle of ideas as well as in a ballet of arms, U.S. forces will strengthen their strategic
communication and improve language and cultural awareness.


-----

2) Defending the homeland in depth: In order to cope with threats to the homeland of the United States, it is
essential to strengthen cooperation with interagency partners as well as to maintain the posture to deter
invasion. To implement this, U.S. forces need not only to strengthen their deterrence by missile defense and
other defensive measures, but also to increase capabilities of consequence management in response to
emergencies.
3) Shaping the choices of countries at strategic crossroads: While the United States encourages the countries
that will affect the future security to become constructive partners by expanding it security cooperation and
other measures, it hedges against the possibility that cooperative approaches by themselves may fail by
strengthening the capabilities of allies and partners, further diversifying its basing posture, and maintaining
its military primacy in key areas.
4) Preventing the acquisition or use of weapons of mass destruction: the United States needs to take both
preventive and responsive measures so that it addresses the threat of WMD by adversaries. U.S. forces
develop capabilities to lessen the damage in case of WMD attacks while they strengthen their capabilities to
identify and track WMD and their related materials as preventive measures. (See Fig. I-2-1-1)

**4. Force Planning**
The 2001 QDR described that the United States adopted an approach to construct its forces for the following
four objectives: 1) to defend the United states; 2) to maintain forward-deployed forces in four critical regions
(Europe, Northeast Asia, the East Asian littoral, and the Middle East/Southwest Asia; 3) to defeat adversaries


-----

swiftly in two threats of operation in overlapping timeframes and to defeat an adversary decisively in one of the
two theaters, and 4) to conduct a limited number of small-scale contingencies
However, since the lessons learned from experiences in the war on terror suggest that U.S. forces need to
operate around the globe and not only in and from the four critical regions and that “swiftly defeating” or
“winning decisively” against adversaries may be less useful for some types of operations, such as a longduration, irregular warfare campaign, the 2006 QDR concludes that while continuing to take the capabilitiesbased approach, the United States has refined its force planning construct, dividing its activities into three
objective areas:1) homeland defense; 2) war on terror/irregular (asymmetric) warfare; and 3) conventional
campaigns:
1) Homeland defense: In steady state, U.S. forces deter external threats to the homeland of the United States
and provide necessary supports to interagency partners by conducting joint trainings and other measures so
that they can contribute to homeland defense. In surge, they respond to attacks by means of WMD and other
weapons, and also take measures to minimize the damage from them.
2) War on terror/irregular warfare: In steady state, U.S. forces deter transnational terrorist attacks through
forward-deployed forces, and also strengthen capabilities of allies and friends and conduct counter
insurgency operations. In surge, they conduct a potentially long-duration irregular warfare campaign, whose
level of effort is equal to that of the operations presently conducted in Iraq and Afghanistan.
3) Conventional campaigns: In steady state, U.S. forces deter invasions or coercion by other countries through
forward-deployed forces, and also strengthen capabilities of allies and friends through security cooperation
such as military exchanges and joint exercises. In surge, they wage two nearly simultaneous conventional
campaigns (or one conventional campaign if already engaged in a large-scale, long-duration irregular
campaign), while reinforcing deterrence against opportunistic acts of aggression. (See Fig. I-2-1-2)

**5. Defense Posture Review of U.S. Forces**
The United States is currently working on the review of its global defense posture[6]. The Bush administration
explained in August 2004 that, over the next ten years, the plan “will bring home about 60,000 to 70,000
uniformed personnel and approximately 100,000 family members and civilian employees.” By reviewing the
posture of its forces, the United States will redeploy most of its large-scale forces that have stationed forward
to cope with threats in the Cold War era to homeland, and strengthening its cooperation with allies and others,
while making efforts to further improve rapid reaction capabilities by moving its most rapidly deployable
forces forward in case of emergencies in unpredictable locations. Also, by capitalizing on force transformation,
the United States aims to improve the capabilities of the forward-deployed force, while attempting to restore
the morale and readiness of the military forces by sending many service members who are stationed aboard
back to the United States. (See Fig. I-2-1-3)

**Fig. I-2-1-3 U.S. Forces Deployment Status**

Note: Materials are taken from the published documents of the U.S. Department of Defense (as of September 2006) and others.


One of the reasons for this review is the change in the security environment. In the Cold War era, the
United States deployed its heavy forces forward with the certainty that it knew adversaries and where potential
battles would be fought. In the security environment after the end of the Cold War, however, it is difficult to
predict who would be enemies and where the battles would occur. In addition, as the transformation of U.S.
forces exploiting innovation in military technologies in recent years have improved their fighting capabilities
and mobility, it is no longer appropriate to evaluate the capability of the forward-deployed forces by the
number of military personnel. Another reason of this posture review is that as stresses on U.S. military
personnel and their family members increased with frequent overseas operations after the end of the Cold war,
there have grown greater concerns about the morale and readiness of the military forces.
As specific measures in this posture review, the United States will send two army divisions deployed in
Europe back to the homeland while organizing more expeditionary forces by deploying Striker Brigade
Combat Teams[7], reinforcing the airborne brigade, and creating a joint task force as well as building new bases


-----

and training facilities in East European countries. Also, the United States aims to introduce the missile defense
(MD) system to Europe by around 2011 and 2012. Accordingly, the United States agreed with Czech and
Poland to start formal negotiations on the deployment of a part of the MD system in the countries[8].
As for Asia, the United States announced to improve the capabilities of U.S. forces to deter, dissuade, and
defeat challenges in the region through strengthened long-range strike capability, streamlined and consolidated
headquarters, and a network of access agreements. Specifically, the United States is working on: 1) the forward
stationing of additional expeditionary maritime capabilities in the Pacific[9]; 2) deployment of advanced strike
assets in the Western Pacific[10]; 3) restructuring U.S. military presence and command structure in Northeast
Asia, (see Section 2.3 and Part III, Chapter 2) ; 4) establishing a network of sites to provide training
opportunities and contingency access in Central and Northeast Asia[11].
As for Africa, the United States announced in February 2007 that the United States Africa Command
would be created by September 2008 as a new Unified Combatant Command of the U.S. forces that would
have an area of responsibility covering Africa[12]. Prior to the creation of this new Command, three Unified
Commands have divided responsibility for U.S. military operations in Africa. Through the creation of the new
Command, the United States aims to enhance its effort to bring peace and security to Africa and to promote
development, health, education, democracy, and economic growth in the region.

**6. Nuclear Strategy**
The Nuclear Posture Review (NPR) announced in 2002 declares a U.S. shift in nuclear force planning from an
approach based on threats of Russia: the United States should maintain the minimum required nuclear forces
for the security of the United States, its allies, and friends, and the United States must have new deterrent force
composed of nuclear forces, conventional forces, and defense systems (missile defense). The NPR asserts that
deterrence should shift from the old triad in the Cold Ware era comprising 1) intercontinental ballistic missiles
(ICBM); 2) submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBM); and 3) strategic bombers to a new triad of 1) nonnuclear and nuclear strike capabilities; 2) active and passive defense system; and 3) defense infrastructure
(defense industry, procurement system, and others). The new triad depends less on nuclear weapons by
emphasizing the importance of missile defense and conventional forces (advanced weapons in particular), and
makes deterrence more reliable in an environment where WMD are proliferating. The 2006 QDR follows the
concept of the new triad defined in the NPR and declares that the United States holds a wider range of
conventional strike capabilities and missile defense capabilities, while maintaining a nuclear deterrent[13].

**7. FY 2008 Budget**
The Fiscal Year 2008 Budget Message of the President, regarding the Department of Defense Base Budget,
excluding the budget for the Global War on Terror (GWOT), attaches importance to 1) ensuring a high state of
military readiness and ground force strength; 2) enhancing the combat capabilities of the United States Armed
Forces; 3) continuing the development of capabilities that will maintain traditional U.S. superiority against
potential threats; and 4) continuing the Department of Defense’s strong support for service members and their
families. The budget amounts to $481.4 billion.
The budget for the GWOT, which had previously been included in a supplementary budget, is included in
the FY 2008 Department of Defense Base Budget in accordance with the direction of the Congress. In the
Fiscal Year 2008 Budget Message of the President, as much as $141.7 billion is appropriated to continue the
fight and reconstitute the force against terrorism. (See Fig. I-2-1-4)

Regarding nuclear forces, the United States completed the reduction of the number of its strategic nuclear
weapons in accordance with the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty I (START I) by December 2001, the
deadline set in the treaty. The current nuclear forces of the United States consist of 550 ICBMs, 14 SSBNs
(Ballistic Missile Submarine, Nuclear-Powered), 432 SLBMs, 114 strategic bombers, and 5,966 nuclear
warheads. In addition, the United States intends to decrease the number of its nuclear warheads to between
1,700 and 2,200 by the end of 2012 in accordance with the Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty (“Moscow
Treaty”).
The U.S. ground forces consist of 10 Army
divisions (approximately 510,000 soldiers) and three
Marine Corps divisions (about 180,000 marines).
U.S. ground forces are forward-deployed in Germany
(two army divisions), the ROK (one Army division),
and Japan (one Marine Corps division). To cope with
the war on terror, U.S. ground forces are reorganizing
their combat and support troops into brigade-sized
modular units[14]. The U.S. Marine Corps is enhancing
its special operations forces, which have been playing
an important role in the war on terror and in military

U.S. soldiers engaged in security operations in Iraq [U.S. Army]

operations in Iraq. It newly established Marine Corps
Special Operations Command (MARSOC)[15] in February 2006, thereby improving its ability to cope with
irregular warfare. The U.S. government is proposing to the Congress that Army permanent end strength be
increased to 547,000 and Marine Corps permanent end strength to 202,000 in order to enhance the military
capabilities and to reduce stress imposed on troops and soldiers deployed in global war against terrorism[16].
The U.S. maritime forces consist of approximately 950 vessels (including approximately 70 submarines),
totaling about 5.68 million tons. The 2nd Fleet is deployed to the Atlantic Ocean, the 6th Fleet to the
Mediterranean Sea, the 5th Fleet to the Persian Gulf, the 3rd Fleet to the eastern Pacific, and the 7th Fleet to the


-----

western Pacific and Indian Ocean. The 2006 QDR announces that the United States will deploy at least six
operationally available and sustainable carriers and 60% of its submarines in the Pacific in order to increase its
military presence in the ocean. In addition, in March 2007, the United States announced that it would move the
home port of an aircraft carrier from the Atlantic Ocean side to San Diego facing the Pacific in early 2010.
The U.S. air forces consist of roughly 3,840 combat aircraft across the Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps.
In addition to carrier-based aircraft deployed at sea, part of the tactical air force is forward deployed in
Germany, the United Kingdom, Japan, and the ROK. In the 2006 QDR, it is assured that the United States will
strengthen its offensive capabilities with conventional weapons by developing a new land-based, penetrating
long-range strike capability to be fielded by 2018, modernizing B-52, B-1, and B-2 bombers, and accelerating
the procurement of unmanned aerial vehicles. On the other hand, it states that the number of the Air Force end
strength will be reduced by about 40,000 full-time equivalent personnel.
As for mobility to deploy U.S. forces to distant locations, the United States is procuring C-17 transport
aircraft and modernizing C-5 transport aircraft to improve the transport capabilities of the forces[17], and
prepositioning equipment at various theaters.
The U.S. forces are increasingly depending on the space system for intelligence collection and
communications. The country announced the U.S. National Space Policy in 2006, in which it states that space
capabilities are vital to its national interests and that it will preserve its freedom of action in space, deter others
from impeding its space system, take those actions necessary to protect its space system, and deny, if
necessary, the use of space that is hostile to the United States.

**3. Military Posture in the Asia-Pacific Region**
The United States, which is also a Pacific nation, continues to play an important role in ensuring the peace and
stability of the Asia-Pacific region by deploying the Pacific Command, a joint command consisting of the
Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps. The Army is composed of two divisions and deploys a total of
approximately 22,000 personnel in the region: the 2nd Infantry Division, the 19th Sustainment Command, and
others totaling about 20,000 in the ROK and the 9th Theater Support Command and others totaling about 2,000
in Japan.
The Navy consists of the 7th Fleet, which is in charge of the area including the western Pacific and Indian
Ocean, and the 3rd Fleet, which is in charge of the area including the east Pacific Ocean and Bering Sea, under
the Pacific Fleet, the headquarters of which is located in Hawaii. The 7th Fleet locates its main bases in Japan
and Guam and deploys one aircraft carrier and other ships with about 15,000 personnel. Its major mission is to
defend and protect the territory, citizens, sea lanes, allies, and other vital interests of the United States, and
ships assigned to the Pacific Fleet include carriers, amphibious ships, and Aegis cruisers.
The Marine Corps deploys one Marine Expeditionary Force in each of the U.S. mainland and Japan under
the Pacific Marine Corps, which has its headquarters in Hawaii. Of this force, the 3rd Marine Division and the
1st Marine Aircraft Wing, which is equipped with F/A-18 and other aircraft is deployed in Japan, with about
15,000 personnel including the forces afloat. In addition, maritime prepositioning ships loaded with heavy
equipment and others are deployed in the western Pacific.
The Air Force deploys three air forces under the Pacific Air Force, the headquarters of which is in Hawaii.
It deploys three air wings equipped with F-15, F-16, C-130 fighters in the 5th Air Force stationed in Japan and
two air wings equipped with F-16 fighters in the 7th Air Force Stationed in the ROK, with about 22,000
personnel in total.

Section 2. Korean Peninsula

On the Korean Peninsula, which covers an area equivalent to approximately 60% of Japan, people of the same
ethnicity have been divided into two—north and south—for more than half a century. Even today, the Republic
of Korea (ROK) and North Korea pit their ground forces of about 1.5 million against each other across the
demilitarized zone (DMZ). North Korea has only half the population of the ROK, and is economically far
outstripped by the ROK. Nevertheless, the size of North Korea’s armed forces far exceeds those of the ROK, as
shown in the figure. Such military confrontation has continued since the armistice of the Korean War.
Maintaining peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula is vital for the peace and stability of the entire
East Asia, to say nothing of Japan. (See Fig. I-2-2-1)

**1. North Korea**
North Korea has been advocating the construction of
a “powerful and prosperous nation” as its basic
national policy, aiming to create a strong socialist
state in all areas—ideology, politics, military affairs
and economy—and it adopts “military-first politics”
to realize this goal. The policy has been defined as a
form of leadership that advances the great
undertaking of socialism by resolving all problems
that arise in the revolution and national construction
on the principle of military first and stressing the
importance of the armed forces as the pillar of the
revolution[18]. Indeed, General Secretary of the Korean
Workers’ Party Kim Jong Il is in a position to
completely control North Korea’s military forces as Chairman of the National Defense Commission and
regularly visits military forces. It would appear that he intends to continue running the country by attaching
importance to and relying on the military forces.
Although North Korea is faced with serious economic difficulties to this day and depends on the
international community for food and other resources, the country seems to be maintaining and enhancing its
military capabilities and combat readiness by preferentially allocating resources to its military forces. For
example, military personnel represent a high proportion of the population, with active-service military
personnel estimated to account for nearly 5% of the overall population[19]. It is noteworthy that North Korea
deploys most of its armed forces along the DMZ. According to an official announcement made at the Supreme
People’s Assembly in April this year, the proportion of defense budget in this year’s national budget is 15.8%,
but it is estimated that the official defense budget represents only a portion of the real defense expenses.
Furthermore, North Korea seems to maintain and reinforce its so-called asymmetric military capabilities by
developing weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and ballistic missiles and also by maintaining large-scale
special operation forces.
By acting in this way, North Korea increases military tension over the Korean Peninsula, and its behavior
constitutes a serious destabilizing factor for the entire East Asian region, including Japan.

**1. WMD and Ballistic Missiles**
Concerning WMD, issues of North Korea’s nuclear weapons program have been pointed out, as well as its
capability of chemical and biological weapons. In particular, North Korea’s nuclear issue has serious influence
on Japan’s national security and it is also a critical problem to be solved by the entire international community
to ensure non-proliferation of WMD.
As for ballistic missiles, North Korea seems to be conducting R&D to extend the range of its ballistic
missiles and to use solid fuel[20]. Also, it is continually pointed out that North Korea is proliferating ballistic
missiles[21]. Combined with the nuclear issue, North Korea’s missile issue is thus becoming a destabilizing factor
not only for the Asia-Pacific region, but also for the entire international community, and there are strong
concerns about the movement of the country.
Furthermore, following the launch of seven ballistic missiles on July 5, 2006, North Korea claimed to have
conducted a nuclear test on October 9 of the same year[22]. These series of acts by North Korea pose serious
threats not only to Japan but also to the peace and stability of East Asia and the international community, and
evoked considerable debate in Japan.


-----

**(1) Nuclear Weapons**
North Korea had been suspected of developing nuclear weapons. In 1993, North Korea refused to allow the
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to conduct a special inspection and declared its withdrawal from
the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). As a result, suspicions of North Korea
developing nuclear weapons at a graphite-moderated nuclear reactor (5-MW reactor)[23] in Yongbyon, to the
north of Pyongyang, were aggravated. The Agreed Framework[24] signed between the United States and North
Korea in 1994 once showed a roadmap to settle this issue through dialogue.
Under the Agreed Framework, the United States had been supplying heavy oil as an alternative energy to
North Korea since 1995, and the Korean Peninsular Energy Development Organization (KEDO) was
established to provide North Korea with light water reactors.
Since then, no violations of the Agreed Framework by North Korea had been detected. However, in
October 2002, the United States announced that North Korea admitted the existence of a uranium-enrichment
program for nuclear weapons when James A. Kelly, then Assistant Secretary of State visited North Korea that
month.
As the international community’s concerns over the nuclear issue of North Korea mounted, North Korea
announced in December 2002 that it would resume the operations of the nuclear-related facilities in Yongbyon
that had been frozen under the Agreed Framework. In January 2003, North Korea again declared the
withdrawal from the NPT. In February of the same year, the IAEA submitted a report on the North Korea
nuclear issue, including the violation of the IAEA Safeguard Agreement, to the U.N. Security Council. At the
end of the month, it was confirmed that the operation of the graphite-moderated nuclear reactor (5-MW nuclear
reactor) in Yongbyon, which had been frozen, was resumed. Subsequently, North Korea claimed that it needed
to maintain a “nuclear deterrent” and indicated the reprocessing of spent fuel rods[25] in April 2003, declared the
completion of the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel rods in October of the same year, released the statement of
its Ministry of Foreign Affairs that North Korea had already produced nuclear weapons in February 2005, and
announced the completion of the extraction of 8,000 spent fuel rods from the restarted graphite-moderated
nuclear reactor in May of the same year. Thus North Korea repeatedly increased international tensions by its
words and actions. In the course of these movements, the supply of heavy oil and the construction project of
light water reactors by the KEDO had been suspended. Eventually in May 2006, the organization officially
decided to abolish the construction project.
On the other hand, in the pursuit of a peaceful solution to this problem and denuclearization of the Korean
Peninsular, Six-Party Talks have been held since August 2003. At the fourth round of the Six-Party Talks held
in 2005, a joint statement was adopted for the first time, which focused on the verifiable abandonment of “all
nuclear weapons and existing nuclear programs” by North Korea. Subsequently, however, North Korea
strongly accused the United States of designating a
bank in Macao dealing with North Korea as “a
financial institution of primary money laundering
concern,” claiming that it is a financial sanction by
the United States.
North Korea suspended its participation in the
Six-Party Talks and in 2006, it launched seven
ballistic missiles and claimed that it had conducted a
nuclear test despite advance warnings by the nations
concerned. Against these actions by North Korea,
which further increased international tensions, the
U.N. Security Council adopted Resolutions 1695 and


-----

1718 and imposed economic sanctions on North Korea. In December 2006, North Korea finally returned to the
fifth round of the Six-Party Talks[26] and in February 2007, the parties, including North Korea, reached an
agreement on “Initial Actions for the Implementation of the Joint Statement” to implement the Joint Statement
made at the fourth round of the Six-Party Talks. The agreement, however, was not implemented as planned.
Regarding North Korea’s response to nuclear issues described above, some people argue that it is resorting
to brinkmanship by intentionally heightening tension to receive compensation. However, others argue that
North Korea’s ultimate objective is to possess nuclear weapons. Because the ultimate goal of North Korea is
believed to be the maintenance of its existing regime, it appears that the two foregoing views are not
incompatible.
In light of a series of North Korea’s words and actions and the fact that the issue of North Korea’s
suspected development of nuclear weapons is not yet elucidated, there is some possibility that North Korea has
already made considerable progress in its nuclear weapons program. In addition, it was concluded in 2006 that
the probability that North Korea had conducted a nuclear test was extremely high (see Note 5). This implies
that there is a high possibility that the country has further advanced its nuclear weapons program, and it is
necessary to keep an eye on the country’s future movement, including the downsizing of nuclear weapons and
deployment of nuclear warheads.

**(2) Biological and Chemical Weapons**
Because North Korea is an extremely closed country and most materials, equipment, and technology used in
the manufacture of biological and chemical weapons are for dual-use, which makes camouflaging their actual
use quite easy, details of biological and chemical weapons developed or held by North Korea are not clear.
However, it is believed that North Korea has a certain level of production base for biological weapons,
although it ratified the Biological Weapons Convention in 1987. As for chemical weapons, it is also believed
that North Korea has several facilities capable of producing chemical agents and has substantial stocks of such
agents. It has not acceded to the Chemical Weapons Convention[27].

**(3) Ballistic Missiles**
It is believed that since the middle of the 1980s, North Korea has manufactured and deployed Scud B and Scud
C[28], a variant of Scud B with extended range, and exported these missiles to Middle Eastern countries and
others. By the 1990s, North Korea allegedly began developing longer-range ballistic missiles, such as Nodong.
There is a strong possibility that the ballistic missile that North Korea test-launched over the Sea of Japan in
1993 was a Nodong. In 1998, North Korea launched a ballistic missile based on Taepondong-1 over Japan.
Furthermore on July 5, 2006, completely lifting its freeze on the launch of ballistic missiles since 1999, North
Korea fired six ballistic missiles early in the morning and a seventh missile in the evening. The third missile is
assessed to have been Taepodong-2 and others Scud and Nodong missiles. Partly because North Korea is an
extremely closed country, details of its ballistic missiles are still unclear. It, however, appears that North Korea
gives high priority to ballistic missiles not only to enhance its military capabilities but also to earn foreign
currency[29] and for other political and diplomatic purposes. At present, the country is thought to be developing a
new intermediate-range ballistic missile and a new solid propellant short-range ballistic missile in addition to
the existing inventory of ballistic missiles[30]. Also, it is necessary to pay attention to the possibility that the
country is improving existing Scuds and Nodongs for the extension of their range or other purposes. (See Fig.
I-2-2-2)
It seems that Nodong is a single-stage ballistic missile based on a liquid fuel propulsion system and a
significant number of Nodong missiles seem to have already been deployed. It is thought to have a range of
about 1,300 km, and is able to reach almost all parts of Japan. Although its specifications are not confirmed in


-----

detail, it is thought to be based on the Scud technology, which would indicate that it does not, for example,

have the accuracy to carry out pinpoint attacks on specific target installations.
Because North Korea is a closed country, it is extremely difficult to verify the intention of its military
activities. It is believed that underground military facilities have been constructed across the country. Nodong,
as is the case with Scud, is thought to be loaded on a transporter-erector-launcher (TEL) and operated with
mobility. Therefore, it would be difficult to detect the concrete signs of the launch of Nodong in advance, such
as its specific launch location and timing.
Also, North Korea has been developing Taepodong-1 with an estimated range of at least 1,500 kilometers.
Taepodong-1 missile is assumed to be a two-stage, liquid propellant ballistic missile with a Nodong as its first
stage and a Scud as its second stage. The missile launched in 1998 was thought to have been based on
Taepodong-1. It is surmised that North Korea was able to verify the performance of the technology concerning
the separation of a multistage booster, attitude control, and thrust control through the launch of this missile.
North Korea seems to have now shifted its focus to the development of Taepodong-2 with a longer range:
Taepodong-1 might have been a transitory product to develop Taepodong-2.
On July 5, 2005, North Korea launched a Taepodong-2 missile from the Taepodong district located in the
northeastern coastal area of the country. The missile is thought to be a two-stage missile with a new booster as
its first stage and a Nodong as its second stage, and with an estimated range of approximately 6,000 kilometers.
It seemed to fail in mid-flight (at a height of several kilometers) several tens of seconds after launch without
separating the first stage and fall near the launch site. North Korea, however, would learn lessons from this
failure and would continue to extend the range of its ballistic missiles. It might even develop derivative
missiles of Taepodong-2[31].
Also on July 5, 2006, North Korea fired other six ballistic missiles from Kittaeryong (approximately 35 km
from Weonsan) located in the southeastern coastal area of the country. All of these missiles seemed to fly a


-----

suborbital flight over approximately 400 km and landed in the Sea of Japan. These missile launches have the
following characteristics, which seem to have simulated real-world combat situations. This is indicative of the
improvement of North Korea’s capability to launch ballistic missiles[32].
a. Launch began before dawn
b. Multiple, serial launches of different types of missiles within a short period of time
c. Use of multiple TELs
d. Missiles with differing operational ranges successfully landed within a certain, concentrated geographical
area.
As the background of North Korea’s rapid strides in the development of its ballistic missiles with only a
few test launches, it is assumed that the country imported various materials and technologies from outside. It is
pointed out that North Korea transfers and proliferates ballistic missiles or its related technologies including
Nodong and its related technologies to Iran and Pakistan and that North Korea promotes the development of
missiles using funds procured by such transfer and proliferation[33]. In light of this, it is necessary to monitor the
transfer and proliferation of ballistic missiles by North Korea in addition to the development and deployment of
these missiles by the country.

**2. Military Posture**
North Korea has been building up its military capabilities in accordance with the Four Military Guidelines
(extensive additional training for existing soldiers, modernizing of the armed forces, arming the entire
population, and converting the entire country into a fortress )[34].
North Korea’s military capabilities[35] are made up mainly of ground forces, with total troop strength of
roughly 1.1 million. Although North Korea has been making efforts to maintain and strengthen its military
capabilities and readiness, most of its equipment is outdated.
On the other hand, North Korea has large scale special operation forces that can conduct various operations
ranging from intelligence gathering and sabotage to guerilla warfare. These forces are thought to be composed
of approximately 100,000 personnel[36]. Moreover, it seems that there are many underground military
installations across the country.

**(1) Activities in Recent Years**
North Korean forces appear to be constantly maintaining and enhancing their capabilities and readiness and
continuing their infiltration exercises[37].
In June 2002, there was an exchange of fire between North Korea and the ROK’s naval vessels across the
Yellow Sea. In February 2003, a North Korean MiG-19 flew over the Northern Limit Line (NLL) across the
Yellow Sea. In March 2003, North Korean military planes including MiG-29 approached and pursued a U.S.
military plane flying over the Sea of Japan.
These military activities may have been simple incidents, or have been intentionally conducted in order to
increase tension as a part of brinkmanship or to raise the morale and support the military structure under the
“military-first politics”. (See Section 2, 1)
In December 2001, a suspicious boat was detected to the southwest of Kyushu and the boat eventually
sank. After salvaged and inspected, the suspicious boat was identified to be a special operations vessel of North
Korea. In 1999 as well, a ship suspected of being a North Korean special operations vessel infiltrated Japanese
territorial waters. It was judged that the boat had later arrived at a harbor in the north of North Korea. (See Fig.
I-2-2-3)

The North Korean Army comprises about one million personnel, and roughly two-thirds of them are believed
to be deployed in the forward areas along the DMZ.
The main body of the army is infantry, but the army
also maintains armored and artillery forces, including
at least 3,500 tanks. North Korea is thought to have
deployed long-range artillery along the DMZ, such as
240-mm multiple-launch rockets and 170-mm selfpropelled guns, which can reach cities including the
capital city of Seoul and bases in the northern part of
the ROK.
The Navy has about 640 ships with total
displacement of approximately 109,000 tons and is
chiefly made of small naval vessels such as highspeed missile crafts. Also, it has about 20 Romeo

-----

class submarines and about 60 midget submarines and about 140 air-cushioned landing craft, the former of
which are thought to be used for infiltration and transportation of the special operation forces.
The Air Force has about 590 combat aircraft, most of which are out-of-date models made in China or the
former Soviet Union, but some fourth-generation aircraft such as MiG-29s and Su-25s are also included. North
Korea has a large number of outdated An-2s as well, which are believed to be used for the transportation of
special operation forces.
North Korea continues to give various types of training to its forces to maintain and strengthen their state
of readiness. On the other hand, given the serious food situation, the military forces seem to be engaged in
agricultural assistance work as well.

**3. Domestic Affairs**
In 1998, the Supreme People’s Assembly[38] was held for the first time in four and a half years after President
Kim Il Sung died in 1994, and Kim Jong Il, General Secretary of the Workers’ Party of Korea was reappointed
as Chairman of the National Defense Commission, which was newly defined as “the highest post of the state.”
At the Supreme People’s Assembly held subsequently in September 2003, Kim Jong Il was reappointed as
Chairman of the National Defense Commission again. Some point out that the North Korean regime is not as
stable as it was due to loosening of social control resulting from both an increasing disparity between the rich
and the poor and a trend of money-worshipping, and declining military morale. However, in view of the fact
that national events[39] are held and negotiations with other countries are made in an orderly manner, the regime
in North Korea based around Kim Jong Il, Chairman of the National Defense Commission, is considered to be
still on the right track.
On the economic front, North Korea has been facing chronic economic stagnation and energy-food
shortages in recent years due to a number of factors including the fragility of its socialist planned economy and
decreased economic cooperation with the former Soviet Union and Eastern European countries following the
end of the Cold War. In particular, it seems that North Korea still has to rely on food assistance from foreign
countries[40]. It is,however, pointed out that many North Koreans are starving and their sense of moral has
declined.
In response to these various economic difficulties, North Korea is trying some realistic reform measures
and changes in its economic management systems, although limited in scale. It is believed that since July 2002,
North Korea has been carrying out a new economic policy, in which wages and commodity prices are raised
and exchange rates are devaluated[41]. However, as it is considered that North Korea is not likely to undertake a
structural reform that would affect its current regime, the country would face various difficulties in
fundamentally improving its current economic situation.

**4. External Relations**
Although North Korea has improved its relationship with Western European countries and others, its activities
related to nuclear and missile issues have raised international concerns.
The United States made it clear that it would make efforts to persuade North Korea to abandon its nuclear
program in close cooperation with other countries, aiming to solve the problem through the Six-Party Talks.
North Korea said that the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula was the “dying wish” of Kim Il Sung and
promised to abandon “all nuclear weapons and existing nuclear program.” North Korea, however, continued to
criticize various policies of the United States, insisting that the United States had yet to abandon its “hostile
policy” toward North Korea, and so there exists a significant gap between the two countries’ stances. In
addition, the United States has repeatedly expressed concerns over the possible proliferation of nuclear
weapons and nuclear-related materials by North Korea and the development, deployment, and proliferation of
ballistic missiles by the country.


-----

Furthermore, the United States has designated North Korea as a terrorist-supporting state because the
abduction issues involving Japanese nationals has not yet been solved and North Korea continued to provide a
haven to the hijackers of Yodo[42].
North Korea and the ROK, while international concern is increasing about the nuclear and other issues of
North Korea, have been consistently continuing talks and economic and human exchanges. North Korea insists
the importance of North-South cooperation and the ROK is willing to continue North-South talks and
exchanges. On the military front, no specific results were achieved after defense ministerial talks were held in
2000. In 2004, however, military talks by generals-level were held twice and the two sides agreed on measures
to prevent incidental conflicts in the Yellow Sea and on the suspension of propaganda activities and the
removal of facilities and equipment for propaganda near the DMZ. Furthermore, by the summer of 2005, a
certain progress was made, including the opening of a hotline between the headquarters of the fleets of North
Korea and the ROK and the completion of the removal of facilities and equipment for propaganda. Since then,
however, no further progress has been made.
Concerning relations between North Korea and China, the China-North Korea Treaty on Friendship,
Cooperation and Mutual Assistance, which was concluded in 1961, is still effective. In 1992, China and the
ROK established diplomatic relations and after that, North Korea’s relations with China seemed to have
changed from the close relationship they enjoyed during the Cold War. Subsequently, however, the leaders of
the two countries made mutual visits and the relationship appeared to have been improved again. Regarding
North Korea’s nuclear issue, China has repeatedly expressed its support to denuclearization of the Korean
Peninsula and has played an active role in resolving this issue by, for example, acting as chairman of the SixParty Talks and contributing to reaching agreement at the forth and fifth rounds of the Talks. Some, however,
point out that relationship between China and North Korea seems to be not as close as they were.
Although relations between North Korea and Russia cooled compared with their relations during the Cold
War, the relations improved as the two countries signed the Russia-North Korea Treaty on Neighborly
Friendship and Cooperation, which lacked articles on military alliance[43] unlike the previous treaty, in February
2000. Subsequently, in July of the same year, Russian President Vladimir Putin visited North Korea. In return,
Kim Jong Il, Chairman of the National Defense Commission visited Russia both in 2001 and 2002. Relations
between North Korea and Russia have thus been strengthened in recent years.
Since 1999, North Korea has made an effort to establish relations with Western European countries and
others, including the establishment of diplomatic relations with European countries and participation in ARF
ministerial meetings. On the other hand, the EU and ASEAN have traditionally expressed concerns over North
Korea’s nuclear and other issues.
In order to solve North Korea’s nuclear issue, it is important for Japan, the United States, and the ROK to
keep working closely together. At the same time, other states such as China and Russia, which are also
participants of the Six-Party Talks, and international organizations including the United Nations and the IAEA
should play important roles in this concern.
It is quite natural to prohibit North Korea from possessing nuclear weapons. There are, however, security
concerns other than nuclear issues regarding North Korea, and it is necessary to closely monitor future
developments on the Korean Peninsula, such as military antagonism as well as the development, deployment,
and proliferation of ballistic missiles by North Korea.
Because North Korea is a closed country, it is difficult to clarify the trends of its policies and activities. It
is, however, necessary to continue to pay close attention to such trends to understand the real intentions of
North Korea.


-----

**2. The ROK**

**1. General Situation**
In the ROK, democracy has taken root through such means as the direct presidential election adopted by the
1987 amendment to the constitution. The Roh Moo-hyun administration, inaugurated in February 2003,
upholds “Policy of Peace and Prosperity,” which succeeds to the thinking of “Engagement Policy” promoted
by the administration of former President Kim Dae-jung.
U.S. forces, mainly the Army, have been stationed in the ROK since the cease-fire of the Korean War. The
ROK has established close security arrangements with the United States primarily based on the United StatesRepublic of Korea Mutual Defense Treaty. In view of the progress in the North-South relations, improved
national strength of the ROK, and changes in the U.S. strategy, the two countries are committed to solving the
issues such as the realignment of the U.S. forces stationed in the ROK and the transition of the operational
control authority[44] over ROK forces, which is currently held by the United States, to the ROK in times of war.
As for the realignment of U.S. forces in the ROK, relocation of U.S. Forces Camp Yongsan located in the
center of Seoul to the Pyongtek area to the south of Seoul and the reposition of U.S. troops stationed in the
northern side of Han Gang to the southern side of the river were agreed upon in 2003. It has, however, become
difficult to complete the relocation to the Pyongtek area by the targeted deadline of the end of 2008 due to
delayed purchase of land required and also for other reasons. As for the transition of the operational control
authority, the U.S. Secretary of Defense and the ROK Minister of National Defense agreed at their meeting in
February 2007 that the two sides would disestablish the U.S.-ROK Combined Forces Command on April 17,
2012 and complete the transition of the wartime operational control authority to the ROK. In the future,
transition to the new “supporting-supported” command relationship between U.S. and ROK forces will be
promoted in line with a substantial decrease in the ROK’s forces, and it is necessary to monitor if the transition
is conducted while maintaining deterrent on the Korean Peninsula.
To assist U.S.-led military operations in Afghanistan, the ROK forces continue to dispatch engineering and
medical units there. Regarding the units dispatched to Iraq in response to the request from the United States,
the ROK continues the dispatch although the scale of dispatched forces has been reduced to at least 1,200 or
approximately one-thirds of the initial size. The country, however, states that it will establish a plan for the
troops dispatched to Iraq to successfully complete their duties there, comprehensively considering the
movements of other countries that have dispatched their units to Iraq.
Between the ROK and China, since the first visit by then ROK Minister of National Defense Cho Seong
Tae to China in August 1999 and the first visit by then Chinese Minister of Defense Chi Haotian to the ROK in
January 2000, efforts have been made to promote military exchanges between the countries, including mutual
visits of naval vessels and air-force planes. In March 2005, the ROK Minister of National Defense visited
China for the first time since 2001 and in April 2006, the Chinese Minister of National Defense visited the
ROK for the first time since 2000. Subsequently in April 2007, the ROK Minister of National Defense Kim
Jang Soo visited China and discussed with the Chinese Minister of National Defense Cao Gangchuan on the
establishment of hotlines between the navies and air forces of the two countries as well as on other topics. At
the ROK-China summit talks held in July 2003, it was agreed for the two countries to develop their cooperative
partnership into all-around cooperative partnership. Their relations in the security area, however, remain on an
initial level compared with relations in other areas, including the economic area.
Between the ROK and Russia, military exchanges have been made in recent years, including exchanges
between senior military officials and mutual visits of naval vessels. When then Russian Minister of Defense
Ivanov visited the ROK in April 2003 and then ROK Minister of National Defense Yoon Kwang-ung visited
Russia in April 2005, the two countries agreed once again on the cooperation in the areas of military


-----

technology, defense industry, and war materials in addition to the promotion of military exchanges. In February
2004, the navies of the two countries conducted joint search and rescue exercises for the first time[45] and at the
ROK-Russia summit meeting held in September 2004, it was regarded that the bilateral relations were shifted
from the “constructive and mutually complementary partnership” to “comprehensive partnership of mutual
trust.” In addition, the ROK has been purchasing tanks and armored vehicles from Russia since 1995 as means
for the redemption of debt from Russia.

**2. Military Affairs**

**(1) Defense Policies**
The ROK has a defensive weakness in that its capital Seoul, where a quarter of the country’s population is
concentrated, is situated close to the DMZ.
The ROK has set the defense objectives as follows: “defending the nation from external military threats and
invasion, upholding the peaceful unification, and contributing to regional stability and world peace.” As one of
“external military threats,” the ROK had been designating North Korea as its “main enemy,” but in its Defense
White Paper 2004, North Korea was no longer described as such[46].
The ROK currently intends to promote “National Defense Reform 2020” to satisfy its defense needs such
as the organization of its military capabilities in line with the development of information and scientific
technologies, balanced development of its Army, Navy, and Air Force, elimination of inefficiency, and buildup
of barrack culture in accordance with social trends. The reform program is based on the following ideas and the
bill on the national defense reform incorporating most of these ideas was passed at the parliament in December
2006.
1) Expansion of civilian base for national defense: Establish the structure in which civilians have the central
role in deciding and implementing defense policies and the military forces focus on executing combat
missions.
2) Buildup of the military structure and system of the forces in conformity with the characteristics of modern
wars: While reducing the size of the standing forces from 680,000 personnel to the level of 500,000
personnel mainly in the Army and that of reserved troops from 3 million personnel to the appropriate level in
line with the reduced size of the standing forces, enhance its war potential by such means as modernizing
equipment.
3) Reorganization of the national defense management system into a low-cost and highly efficient system:
Improve the organization and system to ensure transparency of procurement service and expertise, and in the
area of logistic support, strengthen the infrastructure for computerization and promote outsourcing.
4) Improvement of barrack culture in accordance with trends of the time: Take measures to improve the
environment of military personnel’s service and establish the system to prevent accidents.

**(2) Trends in Defense Buildup**
As for the ROK armed forces, the ground forces consist of three ground army commands of 22 divisions and
two marine divisions, totaling 590,000 personnel; the naval forces consist of three fleets of about 180 vessels
with a total displacement of approximately 141,000 tons; and air forces (Air Force and Navy together) of nine
combat air wings with approximately 610 combat aircraft.
In recent years, the ROK has been trying to modernize its Navy and Air Force with the introduction of
submarines, multi-role helicopters, and F-15Ks as next fighters (F-X). Also, the ROK plans to procure four
Airborne Warning and Control Systems (AWACS) by 2012, and domestically manufactured destroyers (KDXIIs and KDX-IIIs). The KDX-III (an Aegis-equipped destroyer) will be in service in 2008. In addition, the


-----

ROK Navy plans to construct two large transport ships by 2010. In November 2001, the Agency for Defense
Development (ADD) test-launched a short-range missile, and the ROK is believed to be promoting the
domestic production of missiles[47].
The 2007 defense budget amounts to approximately 24,500 billion won, up approximately 8.8% over the
previous fiscal year. (See Fig. I-2-2-4)

**3. U.S. Forces Stationed in the ROK**
Combined with the ROK’s own defense efforts, U.S. forces stationed in the country play a vital role in
preserving the military balance on the Korean Peninsula and providing a deterrent against large-scale armed
conflicts on the peninsula.
At present, the United States is changing the posture of its forces stationed in the ROK based on the
agreement to reposition them to the southern side of Han Gang in two stages (made in June 2003) and the
agreement to reduce the number of its stationed military personnel (approximately 41,000) by 12,500 (made in
October 2004). In the course of these changes, the United States is making efforts to maintain and strengthen
the deterrence capabilities of U.S.-ROK allied forces both by retaining forces of approximately 29,000
personnel (as of the end of September 2006) in the
ROK under the United States-Republic of Korea
Mutual Defense Treaty and by investing $11 billion
in the modernization of the U.S. forces stationed in
the ROK. On the other hand, the ROK, under a
maxim of “cooperative independent defense,” is
committed to ensuring its own defense capabilities
and to firmly developing the ROK-U.S. alliance
towards the future. (See Fig. I-2-2-5)
The United States and the ROK have engaged in
joint exercises in order to increase their combined


-----

defense capabilities in dealing with contingencies on the Korean Peninsula. Among these is the “Foal Eagle”
exercise, a large-scale joint logistics support field exercise, which was staged in March 2007 concurrently with
the Reception, Staging, Onward movement and Integration (RSOI) joint exercise[48].

Section 3. China

**1. General Situation**

**1. General situation**
China has the world’s largest population with a variety of races, religions, and languages in a vast land
surrounded by as many as 14 countries and the Pacific Ocean. Most of its ethnic minorities populate the
borderlands, and have neighbors with the same ethnic origins beyond the borders. China has a long history with
a distinct culture and civilization. The pride derived from the unique history and the experiences of semicolonization after the 19th century have driven their desire for a strong nation and nationalism. China is a state
with a socialist regime, and under the leadership of the Communist Party, aims at building a modern socialist
nation.
To continue the modernization of the country,
China promotes trade, personnel exchanges, and
economic and technological cooperation with other
countries in the world, and makes a point of
establishing a stable security environment in the
surrounding areas. Furthermore, China aims to
establish cooperative relations with other countries in
areas of non-traditional security such as international
crimes, terrorism, maritime search and rescue,
countermeasures for piracy, and regulation of drug
smuggling.
Especially in recent years, China has significantly
increased its international trade, attracted much Prime Minister Abe talking with Chinese President Hu Jintao at the summit
investment from foreign countries, and achieved meeting (October 2006) [Cabinet Public Relations Office]
dramatic economic growth. China has been mounting its position in the world economy and now many
countries welcome deeper economic relation and mutual benefit with China. At the same time, it is pointed out
that China is seeking diplomacy to acquire more natural resources . On the military front, China has been
modernizing its military capabilities, backed up by a constantly increasing defense budget. The country has
thus been steadily growing as an outstanding political and economic power in the region, and the trend of its
military development draws attention from countries in the region.
Domestically, however, China has various problems. Corruption of Communist Party cadres and other
local and central political elites has become a serious political issue, and separatist and independent movements
are also serious. Furthermore, as a result of rapid economic growth, economic gap among urban residents and
environmental pollution have come to surface in addition to widening urban-rural and coastal-inland gaps. The
Hu Jintao administration aims to build a “harmonious society” as its fundamental policy and is committed to
giving first priority to the solution of the aforementioned domestic problems[49].

**2. Relations with Taiwan**
China holds the principle that Taiwan is a part of China, and that the Taiwan issue is therefore an internal
matter. The country maintains that the one-China principle is the underlying premise and foundation for
discussions between China and Taiwan. China has claimed that it would never abandon efforts for peaceful
unification, taking policies and measures to solve issues of the Taiwanese interest including security of their
rights, while it has also expressed strong opposition against any intervention in unification of China by foreign


-----

powers, or against any move toward independence by the Taiwanese and the country has repeatedly stated that
it will not renounce the use of force against Taiwan. In the Anti-Secession Law enacted in March 2005, it is
clearly stated that China will not renounce the use of force. Specifically, the law states that China will employ
non-peaceful means if a major event occurs which would lead to Taiwan’s separation from China.
Since April 2005 when General-Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party (President) Hu Jintao invited
then President Lien Chan of the Nationalist Party of Taiwan to discuss economic cooperation and facilitation of
prompt resumption of talks between China and Taiwan, China has put an emphasis on exchanges mostly with
the opposition parties and business circles of Taiwan. Meanwhile, Taiwanese President Chen Shui-bian has
clearly stated his position of taking up the one-China issue as an agenda, not as a premise for discussion. There
is a gap in the fundamental stances between China and Taiwan as explained above, and the two sides are
unable to find a path to negotiations, and the stalemate continues without any official dialogue. Attention
should be paid to future trends toward a peaceful resolution of the Taiwan issue. The point is whether they will
find any meeting ground to reopen the official dialogue.

**3. Relations with the United States**
There are various problems between the United States and China, such as human rights issues in China,
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, the Taiwan issue, and trade imbalance between the two countries.
Also, China seems to be concerned about increased U.S. influence over the international community through
the war on terrorism, increased U.S. presence in Central Asia, and strengthened cooperation between the
United States and its allies following the review of the U.S. military posture, and to be wary of the inclination
towards “U.S. unipolarity.” On the other hand, the two countries have close relationship on the economic front,
and China would maintain stable relationship with the United States in the future for the sake of its steady
economic development.
The United States believes that international peace and stability and expansion of free and fair trade are
crucial for China as well as for other countries in the world and that China has a responsibility to support these
common interests in cooperation with other major powers in the world. At the same time, the United States
recognizes that China is facing strategic crossroads and has the greatest potential to compete militarily with the
United States and field disruptive military technologies that could over time offset traditional U.S. military
advantages. Accordingly, the United States thinks it necessary to urge China to become a constructive partner
in the international community, and to hedge against the case that such effort would fail[50]. Based on this
recognition, the United States makes it an objective of its policy that China continues to be its economic
partner and becomes a “responsible stakeholder.”[51]

In response, Chinese President Hu Jintao, when he visited the United States in April 2006, stated that China
shared strategic interests with the United States in a wide range of areas and the country would promote
constructive and cooperative relationship with the
United States. China is thus showing an attitude of
attributing importance to stable China-U.S.
relationship.
Military exchanges have been promoted between
China and the United States. In October 2005, then
U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld visited
China, and in July 2006, Vice Chairman of China’s
Central Military Commission Guo Boxiong visited
the United States. Also, in April 2006, President
Bush and President Hu Jintao agreed that the two


-----

countries would begin a dialogue about the strategic nuclear policies and others. The United States has stated
that it would accept a visit by the commander of the Chinese Second Artillery Corps (Strategic Rocket Forces)
to the United States.
As for military exercises, China dispatched an observer to a U.S. military exercise (U.S. Pacific Command
exercise “Valiant Shield”) for the first time in June 2006 and the delegated Chinese officer visited USS Kitty
Hawk, an aircraft carrier. Subsequently, in September and in November 2006, when ships of the Chinese Navy
visited Hawaii and San Diego and when ships of the U.S. Navy visited Chanchiang, China, respectively, the
Navies of the two countries conducted joint exercises.
The United States, regarding the development of a U.S.-China military-to-military relationship, states that
Our goal is to improve mutual understanding and prevent conflict by communicating U.S. resolve to maintain
deterrence and stability in the Asia-Pacific region[52].

**4. Relations with Russia**
Since 1989 when then Secretary-General Gorbachev of the Soviet Union’s communist party visited China to
end China-Soviet confrontation, both countries have maintained a stance of placing importance on the bilateral
relation. Deepening of “strategic partnership” between China and Russia, which was established in the middle
of the 1990s, has been emphasized through a regular exchange of visits by their leaders. In 2001, the ChinaRussia Treaty of Good-Neighborliness and Friendly Cooperation[53] was concluded. Subsequently in 2004, the
longstanding issue of border demarcation between the two countries, which once evolved into a military clash,
came to a settlement.
The two countries, through these mutual exchanges, have had a goal in common to promote world multipolarization and building of a new international order. In addition, some economic motives seem to have driven
good relationship between them. China has a long-term concern of securing reliable supply of resources and
energy, while Russia finds potential of Chinese markets attractive and shows a keen interest in diversifying
exports to China, which are now lopsidedly dominated by resources and energy.
On the security front, Russia is the world’s largest exporter of weapons to China. Since the 1990s, China
has purchased modern weapons from Russia, including Su-27 and Su-30 fighter aircraft, Sovremenny-class
destroyers, and Kilo-class submarines. At the Japan-Russia summit meeting held in November 2005, then
Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi pointed out to the Russian President Vladimir Putin that it was necessary to
execute weapons export to China in a careful manner, and President Putin answered that Russia was not the
leader of weapons export but the country surely felt its responsibility. During his visit to Russia in January
2006, then State Minister for Defense Nukaga also requested then Defense Minister Ivanov to ensure
transparency of, and to be careful with, weapons export to China in order to maintain the regional military
balance.
China and Russia keep steady military exchanges including a regular exchange of visits by highest-ranking
defense officials. Also, the two countries have held a joint military exercise. They conducted their first joint
exercise in Shandong Peninsula,,China in August 2005. In August 2007, a multilateral joint exercise will be
conducted in the Lanzhou Military Region in China and in the Volga-Ural Military District in Russia by the
member states of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO)[54]. Through these joint military exercises with
Russia, China would be able to deepen mutual understanding and build confidence between the two forces; to
demonstrate China and Russia as main players in multi-polar world; and to learn operational methods of
Russian weapons and military doctrines.

**5. Relations with North Korea**
China regards the relation with North Korea as “traditional friendship,” and North Korea seems to heavily rely
on China for food assistance and energy supply. Accordingly, China is believed to have a stronger influence on


-----

North Korea than other countries do. China supported the U.N. Security Council Resolution 1695, which
condemned the launch of ballistic missiles by North Korea in 2006 and Resolution 1718, which imposed
sanctions on North Korea in relation to the country’s nuclear tests. China, wanting to ensure a stable regional
situation, has played an active role towards the solution of North Korea’s nuclear issues, serving as chairman of
the Six-Party Talks, which have been held in Beijing since 2003. In light of the influence of China over North
Korea, the international community expects that China will continue to implement the active effort for the
solution of the issues.

**6. Relations with Other Countries**

**(1) Relations with Southeast Asian Countries**
As for its relations with countries in Southeast Asia, China has been developing bilateral relations with all the
countries in the region through active mutual top-level visits and other means[55]. China is also actively involved
in multilateral frameworks such as ASEAN plus 3 and the ARF (ASEAN Regional Forum). Through these
diplomatic forums, the country is deepening economic and cultural cooperation with ASEAN countries. In
addition, China is eager to promote cooperation relations in the security area.

**(2) Relations with Central Asian Countries**
The Xinjian Uygur region, a western province in China, is situated next to Central Asia. It directly shares
borders with three countries of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan, and has many ethnic minorities settled
in the areas straddling borders. Naturally the region has lively exchanges of people with those countries. Thus
China is greatly concerned about the political stability and security situations in Central Asian states, which
might be influenced by terrorism caused by Islamic extremists and other factors. Chinese engagement in the
Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), which was established in June 2001, is viewed as an indication of
such concerns held by China. (See Fig. I-2-3-1)

In recent years, Russia and China, main member states of the organization, seem to especially aim at
deterring the influence of the United States and expanding that of the SCO over this central region of the
continent, by announcing the SCO summit communiqué, which in effect encourages withdrawal of the U.S.
troops from Central Asia[56], and granting the observer status to regional powers such as India, Pakistan, and
Iran.


-----

**(3) Relations with South Asian Countries**
With regard to South Asian countries, it appears that China has been maintaining a hostile relationship with
India due to border conflicts. However, it has a favorable relationship with Pakistan, which has a hostile
relationship with India as well, including military cooperation, such as export of weapons and transfer of
military technologies. On the other hand, China has been recently committed to improving its relationship with
India. Through active mutual visits by leaders, China regards relations with India as a strategic partnership and
states that the issue of border demarcation between the two countries, which once culminated in military
clashes, is also progressing. As regards military exchanges, the Chinese Navy conducted a joint naval search
and rescue exercise with Pakistan off the coast of Shanghai in October 2003 as China’s first joint exercise with
a foreign navy, and a joint naval search and rescue exercise with India off the coast of Shanghai. Furthermore,
in November 2005, the Navy conducted a joint naval search and rescue exercise with Pakistan as its first joint
exercise abroad. With India as well, the Chinese Navy conducted the second joint naval search and rescue
exercise in the India Ocean in November 2005. More recently, in April 2007, they conducted exercises
including a communication exercise in Qingdao offshore. It seems that China has come to attribute importance
to military exchanges with India as well, while keeping a good balance with military exchanges with Pakistan,
which has been a traditional friend of China.

**(4) Relations with EU Countries**
Trade between China and EU countries has been remarkably growing in recent years. For China, the EU is now
as important as Japan and the United States as a partner, especially in the economic area. China, through
diplomatic opportunities, strongly demands EU countries to lift the arms embargo against China, which has
been imposed since after the Tiananmen Square incident took place in 1989. Although some EU countries
voiced their readiness for the lifting, Japan has sent messages to object to the lifting. In January 2007, Japanese
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso that the lifting of the
arms embargo on China would have an impact on the East Asian security environment and so Japan was
opposed to the lifting. In response, President Barroso assured Prime Minister Abe that the EU had no plans for
an imminent lifting of its arms embargo on China, although it was working to lift the embargo based on the
decision made by the European Council and that it would by no means lead to a qualitative or quantitative
increase in arms sales even if the embargo was lifted. It is, however, necessary to pay attention to future
discussions about the arms embargo on China made within the EU.

**7. Overseas Activities**
China states that it will consistently support
peacekeeping operations conducted in line with the
U.N. Charter and according to the “China’s National
Defense in 2006”, the country has sent a total of
5,915 military personnel to participate in U.N.
peacekeeping operations and eight lost their lives in
the operations. As of April 2007, China has
dispatched a total of 1,820 troops, police officers, and
military observers to 12 U.N. peacekeeping
operations, such as the United Nations Interim Force
in Lebanon (UNIFIL), thus showing its presence in
the operations to some degree. Also, China is
engaged in international disaster relief operations.

For example, some Chinese military personnel participated in international assistance to conduct relief
activities in the area devastated by tsunami in the Indian Ocean at the end of 2004. (See Fig. I-2-3-2)

**8. International Transfer of Weapons**
China has provided developing countries in Asia and Africa with weapons like small arms, tanks, and aircraft,
and it is reported that the main recipients are Iran, Pakistan, and Myanmar. Some point out that China is
supplying weapons to countries having problems in terms of democracy and human rights, and it is important
to see whether China improves its transparency regarding the international transfer of weapons.

**2. Military Affairs**

**1. General**
China, as its basic objectives and obligations for national security, declares to defend its national sovereignty,
territorial integrity, and maritime rights and interests; to further develop its economy and society; and to


-----

continuously strengthen its comprehensive national power. In order to achieve these objectives and obligations,
the country is committed to balanced economic and defense construction. China is aggressively promoting the
“Revolution in Military Affairs with Chinese Characteristics” based on its military strategy to win an
informationalized war[57], in order to cope with global trends in military developments, including those observed
in the Gulf War, the Kosovo conflict, and the Iraq War. As for the military capabilities of the People’s
Liberation Army, the PLA is not entirely equipped with weapons of sufficient firepower and mobility: many of
its weapons are outdated although the Army has the world’s largest number of personnel and equipment items.
Accordingly, China has been promoting the modernization of the PLA. Specifically, China has reduced the
number of its military personnel, mainly in the army, and been modernizing its entire armed forces, especially
its naval and air forces, and nuclear and missile capabilities. In addition, it is focusing more energy on
enrollment and training of highly talented personnel and on the improvement of joint operational capabilities
among services and arms.
As for the specific objective of China’s rapid military modernization, it seems that the country is focusing
on the implementation of measures to deal with the Taiwan issue[58]. Some, however, argue that China is
modernizing its military capabilities not just for the treatment of the issue, in light of the country’s rapid
development, long-lasting modernization of its military forces, and lack of transparency regarding its military
capabilities. Concerns over the future modernization of the Chinese military forces have been thus increasing[59].
China regards the modernization of its military capabilities as part of the nation’s modernization[60], and it is
necessary to carefully analyze the influence that the military modernization by China, which is steadily
growing as a regional power, will exert on the regional situation and Japan’s national security.

**2. Transparency in Military Strength**
Historically, China has not disclosed information on its possession of equipment, the pace of acquisition, the
unit-level compositions of services, records of main military operations and exercises, or the amount and
detailed breakdowns of the national defense budget. As China is steadily growing as a political and economic
power of the region, the trends of its military developments draw attention from countries in the region. Under
these circumstances, in order to address concerns held by those countries over China, it is becoming
increasingly important for China to increase transparency in its national defense policy and military
capabilities.
China released a white paper on defense titled “China’s National Defense” in 1998, which has since been
published every two years. In December 2006, China published “China’s National Defense in 2006”. It is
appreciable that China has continuously published documents on its national security because such documents
would contribute to improving transparency concerning China’s military capabilities. However, it needs to be
pointed out that the five white papers published in the past have not substantially improved the transparency.
For example, as to detailed breakdowns of the national defense spending, the papers merely announced the
total amount and general purposes for each of the following three categories: living expenses of personnel,
maintenance cost of operations, and expenditures for equipment.
Also, in January 2007, when China conducted an anti-satellite weapon test, Japan expressed concerns in
relation to the safe use of space and national security and demanded China to give explanations about the test
and the country’s intention. The Chinese government, however, did not give sufficient explanations about the
details and intention of the test enough to allay Japan’s concerns.
It is desired that China will increase transparency in its military capabilities through various opportunities
in the future.


-----

**3. National Defense Budget**
As to the national defense expenditures, one of the elements to measure military strength of a state, China
announced that its national defense budget for FY 2007 would be approximately 347.2 billion yuan, up 17.8%
over that of the previous fiscal year. Thus China’s official defense budget recorded a growth rate of over 10%
for 19 consecutive years in terms of the initial defense budget. This pace of increase in official defense
expenditures means that the defense budget will increase two-fold every five years, and that the size of the
official national defense budget of China has nominally grown 16 times in the last 19 years[61]. With respect to
the relationship between national defense and economy, “China’s National Defense in 2006” states “guided by
the principle of coordinated development of national defense and the economy., Thus, the country regards the
buildup of defense capabilities as a task that is as important as economic construction. Accordingly, China will
continue to input resources for the improvement of its national defense capabilities to the extent that it will not
hamper its economic construction and so the country’s military capabilities will continuously be modernized.

Note: The total defense budgets for fiscal 2002 and 2004 were not disclosed, and there is a discrepancy when we apply the disclosed
growth rates and amounts of increase to the initial budgets of FY 2001 and FY 2003.This graph uses 168.4 billion yuan and 210
yuan for FY 2002 and FY 2004, respectively. These are calculated on the assumption that disclosed growth rates and amounts of
increase are based on the actual defense expenses for FY 2001 and FY 2003.

Also, it must be noted that the amount of defense budget announced by China is considered to be only part
of its actual military expenditures[62]. For example, it is thought that not all of the equipment procurement costs
and research and development expenses are included in the official figures for defense expenditures.

**4. Military Posture**
China’s military forces are composed of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), the People’s Armed Police
Force[63], and the militia[64]. The PLA, created and led by the Chinese Communist Party, consists of the Army,
Navy, Air Force, and the Second Artillery Corps. (See Fig. I-2-3-4)

China has made an independent effort to develop nuclear and ballistic missile forces since the middle of the
1950s, seemingly with a view to ensuring deterrent, supplementing its conventional forces, and maintaining its
voice in the international community. In addition to ballistic missiles, China possesses one hundred and several
tens of medium-range H-6 (Tu-16) bombers.
As for ballistic missiles, China currently possesses approximately 30 Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles
(ICBM), of which main missiles are assumed to be the fixed type with liquid fuel propellant system. This type
of missile, in general, requires time-taking injection of liquid fuel immediately before launching, thus signs of


-----

launching can be detected beforehand, which may invite preemptive attack. For this reason, China has been
promoting the development of the DF-31 series, new, mobile-type with solid fuel propellant system ICBMs to
be mounted onto the transporter-erector-launcher (TEL) as well as the development of new-type submarinelaunched ballistic missiles (SLBM) based on a solid fuel propellant system. Also, China possesses a
considerable number of intermediate-range ballistic missiles (IRBM) and medium-range ballistic missiles
(MRBM) covering the Asian region including Japan. Although DF-3 missiles of a liquid fuel propellant system
have been traditionally deployed, it is believed that conversion to DF-21 missiles of a solid fuel propellant
system, which can be transported and operated on the TEL, have been promoted recently. These missiles are
capable of carrying nuclear warheads. Furthermore, as to short-range ballistic missiles (SRBM) including DF15 and DF-11 missiles deployed along the shore of the Taiwan Straight, China is estimated to possess at least
700 plus several dozens of those missiles, and the number seems to be increasing every year. It is believed that
efforts to improve the performance of aforementioned ballistic missiles including their accuracy are being
continued. Also, research and development activities on missiles with multiple warheads are reportedly
conducted[65].
In addition, China is believed to be advancing the development of cruise missiles. Once becoming available
for practical use, those missiles might complement ballistic missile forces, covering the Asia-Pacific region
including Japan. (See Fig. I-2-3-5)

**(2) Ground Forces**
The size of the Chinese ground forces is the largest in the world with approximately 1.6 million personnel.
Since 1985, China has been continuously seeking to modernize its armed forces by curtailing personnel and
streamlining organizations and systems in order to improve efficiency. The country aims to develop military
forces with high capabilities, while reducing units inferior in equipment and technologies. In addition, China
has prioritized the introduction of modern equipment for its airborne troops and special operation forces and
sought to improve its mobility. The country is also working on a reform to improve its logistical support
capability.

**(3) Naval Forces**
The naval forces consist of three fleets—the North
Sea, East Sea, and South Sea Fleets. The Chinese
Navy has approximately 780 ships (including
approximately 60 submarines) with a total
displacement of approximately 1.07 million tons. The
navy is in charge of the maritime national defense
and protecting the sovereignty of territorial waters
and maritime rights and interests. China imported
modern Kilo-class submarines from Russia and
actively constructed new types of domestically-built
submarines to enhance the submarine capabilities of
the Navy. Also, the country is promoting the
introduction of sea combatant crafts with improved
air defense and anti-ship capabilities to the Navy and
is strengthening the capabilities of landing ships and supply ships. In view of the way how the Navy is being
modernized, it is believed that China is trying to build capabilities to perform operations in sea areas more
distant from the country. Also, China seems to have strong interest in the possession of an aircraft carrier[66].

**(4) Air Forces**
As for air forces, the Chinese Air Force and Navy
have approximately 3,520 combat aircraft in total.
The number of fourth-generation modern fighters is
rising sharply. China mass produces J-10 fighters
domestically and is promoting import and licensed
production of Su-27 fighters as well as import of Su30 fighters equipped with anti-surface attack
capabilities from Russia. With regard to surface-toair missile units, it is reported that China plans to
import high-performance S-300PMU-2 from Russia,
in order to improve its air defense capabilities. In
addition to the introduction of modern fighters,
China continuously seeks to modernize its air forces
to acquire the in-flight refueling capability and early warning and control systems, which are essential for the
operation of modern air capabilities. Furthermore, it is reported that China plans to import a great number of Il76 large cargo aircraft from Russia. In view of the way how the Air Force is being modernized, China seems to


-----

aim at building air-to-surface and air-to-ship strike capabilities as well as combat capabilities to maintain a
certain degree of air superiority in more forward areas, in addition to its air defense capabilities[67].
Also, China has begun to enhance airborne electronic warfare and intelligence gathering capability in
addition to actual reconnaissance flights against surrounding countries. In particular, in recent years, flights by
Chinese aircraft that are thought to be designed for intelligence gathering against Japan have been active, and
attention should be paid to these activities conducted in the area surrounding Japan.

**5. Trends in Education and Training**
In recent years, the PLA has been conducting large-scale exercises including joint exercises of the Army,
Navy, and Air Force as well as landing exercises, in order to advance its operational modernization. In 2002,
the PLA promulgated the Outline of Military Training and Evaluation as a revision to the previous training
doctrine, in order to reform exercises based on science and technologies and constantly promote new forms of
exercises. Also, the national military training conference held in 2006 decided upon a shift from military
training under the conditions of mechanization to military training under the conditions of informationalization,
and the PLA’s General Staff Department indicated a policy of continuously conducting military training under
the conditions of informationalization and joint exercises for multiple types of forces in stipulating the focus of
exercises for this year.
In addition, the PLA is making efforts to develop military personnel versed in science and technologies. In
2003, a strategic project for talented people was launched to develop human resources capable of directing an
informationalized war and of building informationalized armed forces. The project has a goal of achieving a
big leap in the training of talented military personnel by 2020.

**6. Trends in National Defense Science and Technologies**
In recent years, the PLA has introduced not only equipment imported from abroad such as Russia, but also
domestically-produced new models. Modernization of Chinese military capabilities has been supported by
progress in defense science and technologies. Favorable growth of the Chinese defense industry was once
hindered by inefficiency caused by too much secrecy and other factors, but in recent years, reform of the
defense industry has progressed. According to China’s National Defense in 2004, special focus has been placed
on two-way exchanges of technologies where military technologies are utilized for building the national
economy, and in turn civilian technologies are absorbed for the national defense build-ups. Specifically,
technologies of the defense industry have contributed to development of civilian space exploration, the aviation
industry, and the boats and ships industry.
In China’s National Defense in 2006, the country states that the country “encourages and supports
participation in international cooperation and competition in civilian-military industries,” thus showing its
interest in absorbing foreign technologies through civilian-military industries.
As to space technologies, the successful launching of the Shenzhou V spaceship in 2003, which sent
China’s first astronaut into space, followed by the successful 5-day trip in space of the Shenzhou VI spaceship
in October 2005, which carried two astronauts, demonstrated anew to the world technological strength of China
in this field. The field of space exploration and that of military are organizationally linked to each other in
China, and also, space rockets and ballistic missiles share some technologies in common. Hence, two-way
exchanges of technologies are believed to be promoted further in the future.
China conducted an anti-satellite weapons test in January 2007. Although the details of the test are
unknown, it is presumed that the country conducted it by applying the ballistic missile technology, and there
was a possibility that China used advanced technology for terminal guidance to the targeted artificial satellite
and other purposes. The test implies the possibility that China regards attacks against artificial satellites as a
part of their military operations.

**7. Maritime Activities**
In November 2004, a submerged Chinese nuclear-powered submarine intruded into Japan’s territorial waters,
violating international law. Including this incident, Chinese naval vessels have been observed navigating near
Japan. These vessels seem to have conducted some exercises or intelligence collections. Some other naval
vessels as well as Chinese government-owned ships are also observed being engaged in oceanographic research
within the exclusive economic zone of Japan. Furthermore, China has been exploring and developing oil gas
fields including Shirakaba (Chunxiao in Chinese). Their contract mining field and the structure extend to the
eastern side of the intermediate line between Japan and China. In September 2005, Chinese naval vessels were
seen navigating near these oil gas fields[68]. In October 2006, a Chinese Song-class submarine broached in the
vicinity of the USS Kitty Hawk aircraft carrier of the United States in international sea waters reportedly near
Okinawa. This is a noteworthy military incident[69]. Also, Chinese naval vessels began to conduct overseas
exercises, including the first joint exercises with foreign naval vessels in Pakistan, India, and Thailand in
November 2005, first joint exercises with the U.S. Navy in the United States in 2006, and the first participation
in a multilateral joint exercise in March 2007, a counterterrorism multilateral joint maritime exercise conducted
in Pakistan. China has thus intensified its maritime activities. In addition to activities in the Japanese waters,
China is enhancing its bases of activities in the Spratly and Paracel islands, over which it has territorial disputes
with countries including ASEAN counties. China is seemingly interested in the Indian Sea area, which
provides a shipping route for transporting crude oil from the Middle East.
China explicitly states in its laws and others that its Navy plays a role of safeguarding maritime rights and
interests and protecting maritime safety. Also, taking into general conditions of the country, including its
geographic conditions and economic globalization, the objectives of Chinese naval activities are considered to
be as follows.
The first objective is to intercept naval operations by enemies in waters as far possible from the country to
defend the Chinese territory and territorial waters. Behind this, there is an increase in effectiveness of attacks at
long ranges, which is due to recent progress in science and technologies.
The second objective is to develop military capabilities to deter and prevent independence of Taiwan.
China maintains that it will not allow any foreign intervention in solving the Taiwan issue and realizing the
unification of China. If China aims to hold back by force foreign intervention into Taiwan, which is surrounded
by the sea in all four directions, it needs to enhance its naval operational capabilities.
The third objective is to acquire, maintain, and protect maritime rights and interests. China has embarked
on the project of exploring and drilling oil and gas fields and building associated facilities in the East China
Sea and the South China Sea. The project includes the building of drilling facilities in the oil and gas field, the
geological structure of which runs to the eastern side of the intermediate line between Japan and China. It is
believed that China aimed to highlighting its Navy’s capabilities to acquire, maintain, and protect maritime
rights and interests by operating naval vessels near the drilling facilities in September 2005.
The fourth objective is to defend sea lanes of China, a lifeline for increasingly globalized Chinese
economy. It depends on future international situations how far the Chinese Navy should protect sea lanes by
itself, but given recent modernization of the Chinese Navy and Air Force, reach of its capabilities appears to be
expanding beyond waters near China.
China seems to conduct maritime activities to achieve the aforementioned objectives. Attention should be
paid to these activities, including the operation of naval vessels and implementation of oceanographic research
activities near Japan.

**3. Military Capabilities of Taiwan**
Since January 2004, Taiwan has been implementing a new transformation program called the “Jingjing
Program” to manage national defense resources more efficiently, reduce the total number of military personnel,
promote the restructuring of armed forces, and to shift to a voluntary service system. According to the program,
the number of military personnel will be reduced to 275,000 by the end of 2008. At the same time, the
Taiwanese armed forces attribute importance to the introduction of advanced technologies and improvement of
joint operational capabilities. Taiwan’s defense expenditures had been remaining between 24 million to 28
million Taiwan dollars since 2000[70], but in August 2005, Taiwan President Chen Shui-ban announced Taiwan’s
policy to increase the ratio of the national defense budget to its GDP to 3% within three years, which was
approximately 2.4% in fiscal 2005, thereby meeting increasing demands for national defense. (See Fig. I-2-3-6)
At present, Taiwan has 41 army brigades and two marine brigades with a total of approximately 215,000

personnel. In addition, it is believed that the number
of reserve personnel available for mobilization is
about 1.65 million in total for air, naval, and ground
forces. As to naval capabilities, Kidd-class destroyers
imported from the United States have entered service,
and relatively modern frigates are in possession. As
to air capabilities, Taiwan imported F-16 fighters and
Mirage 2000 fighters, and completed the introduction
of domestically produced Jing Guo fighters.
As mentioned earlier, in view of the fact that China is enhancing its missile forces and naval and air forces,
Taiwan thinks it necessary to modernize the equipment of its armed forces. The Executive Yuan of Taiwan
formulated a draft budget in June 2004 in order to purchase eight diesel submarines, 12 patrol planes (P-3C), a
PAC-3 latest Patriot Missile System model, and a modernized PAC-2 from the United States, but the budget
has not yet been approved by the Legislative Yuan, which is dominated by opposition party members. The
Executive Yuan included the cost of purchasing F-16C/D fighters in the fiscal 2007 budget request, but the


-----

request has yet to be approved by the Legislative Yuan.
In comparing military capabilities of China and Taiwan, various factors should be taken into consideration
beyond simple quantitative comparison. In general, the capabilities of China and Taiwan can be compared as
follows:
1) Concerning ground forces, China outnumbers Taiwan, but Chinese capabilities for airborne and seaborne
landings on the Taiwan mainland are limited, and China is committed to constructing large landing ships.
2) Concerning naval and air forces, China has outnumbered Taiwan in terms of quantity, while Taiwan has had
qualitative superiority so far. However, China is steadily modernizing its naval and air forces in recent years.
3) Concerning missile attack capabilities, China possesses at least 700 and several tens of short-range ballistic
missiles whose range covers Taiwan, while Taiwan seems to have few effective countermeasures.
At any rate, the comparison of military capabilities should take account of various factors, such as
operational postures, proficiency of military personnel, and logistics, as well as the size of forces and
performance and quantity of weapons. In view of this, attention should be paid to the modernization of both
Chinese and Taiwanese military capabilities and sales of weapons by the United States to Taiwan. As China is
rapidly modernizing its military forces, the military balance between China and Taiwan is changing to the
advantage of China, and major changes might be made in Taiwan’s qualitative superiority in the near future.

**COMMENTARY**

**Aerospace Development in China**

China has been putting efforts in aerospace development, and according to China’s Space Activities in
2006, a white paper published in October last year, the country has developed recoverable remote sensing
satellites, Dongfanghong communication and broadcasting satellites, Feng Yun meteorological satellites,
Shijian scientific research and technological experiment satellites, Ziyuan earth resource satellites, and
Beidou navigation satellites. The country is also currently pushing forward with projects to develop an
ocean satellite series and launch environment and disaster monitoring and forecasting micro-satellites[1]. As
for the Long-March launch vehicle series, the country achieved forty-six consecutive successful launches
between October 2006 and the end of 2005 according to China’s Space Activities in 2006. The projects in
the next five years include the development of powerful thrust carrier rockets, high-resolution earth
observation system, and scientific research satellites such as a space telescope and new recoverable
satellites, the realization of extra vehicular activities and docking experiments, and the development and
launch of the Chang’e 1 moon-orbiting satellite.

_China’s Aerospace Activities in 2006 cites national defense as one of the objectives of the country’s_
aerospace activities, and it seems that China is considering aerospace development important from the
military aspect as well. The China National Space Administration, the aerospace agency of the
government, is, in fact, placed under the Commission of Science, Technology and Industry for National


-----

Defense, and the _China’s National Defense in 2006 white paper describes the current condition of the_
country’s science, technology and industry for national defense as follows: “Major scientific and
technological projects, such as manned space flights and the Lunar Probe Project, are being carried out to
spur the leapfrogging development of high-tech enterprises combining military and civilian needs and to
bring about overall improvements in defense-related science and technology.” In this way, the military
and non-military sections of China’s aerospace development are seemingly closely linked, and there is a
possibility that aerospace development in the country may be used for military purpose such as
information collection, communication and navigation.
China shows interest in anti-satellite weapons as well, and conducted an experiment in January this
year in which a satellite of the country was destroyed using the ballistic missile technology. It is also
pointed out that China is developing a device to interfere with satellites by using a laser.

1) China is also putting efforts in aerospace international cooperation, and collaborating with Brazil, France, Russia, Ukraine and other countries. China is also
taking part in GALILEO, the project of the European Space Agency to develop a satellite navigation system.

Section 4. Russia

**1. General Situation**

After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia fell
into a state of confusion and chaos, and under these
circumstances, the Putin administration’s policy is
supported by the Russians: the administration insists
that only a strong nation would bring order and
stability to the country. Towards the goal of creating
a multipolar world, the administration has been
conducting active summit diplomacy with major
countries in the region including China and India. In
July 2006, Russia successfully chaired the G8
Summit held in Saint-Petersburg.
At the inauguration ceremony making the start of
his second term, President Vladimir Putin made clear
his emphasis on domestic policy, and he has pressed
ahead with social reforms. He has at the same time moved to rebuild a centralized structure by abolishing the
direct electoral system of regional governors. The Russian economy remains in good shape thanks to a rise in
the international market price of crude oil, its major export since 1999[71]. However, the economy depends on the
export of energy resources and the living standards of Russians are not high enough. Russia is implementing
economic structural reforms and other policies to solve these problems.

**2. Security and Defense Policies**

**1. Basic Posture**
Russia revised its “National Security Concept of the Russian Federation” in January 2000[72]. The Concept
recognizes that two exclusive trends exist in the current international situation: the trend towards the multipolar
world made by countries including Russia and the trend towards the world dominated by the Western
countries. As threats to Russia’s security under these international circumstances, the document lists
international terrorism, a movement to decrease the role of the United Nations, the eastward expansion of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)[73] and others[74], and states that these factors, together with an
increase of hi-tech weapons in the Western countries and a delay in the reforms of Russia’s armed forces and
the military-industrial complex, have weakened Russia’s national security. The Concept concludes that from
this perspective, Russia should take deterrent measures, including the possession of nuclear forces, to prevent
invasions of any scale.
In line with this Concept, the Military Doctrine of the Russian Federation was stipulated in April 2000 as
the basic philosophy underlying Russian national defense policies. The Doctrine states that potential threats
remain both at home and abroad and in some areas these latent threats are growing despite the decreased
possibility of large-scale wars and the reduced threat of a direct invasion in a traditional form. Based on this
recognition, it states that the objective of national defense should be to deter aggression by any means
including the use of nuclear weapons and that Russia reserves the right to use nuclear weapons in retaliatory
attacks in response to a large-scale invasion with the use of conventional weapons.
In addition, The Priority Tasks of the Development of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation was
published in 2003 to embody the aforementioned Concept and Doctrine. Concerning the military duties, this


-----

report points out the possibility of using armed forces not only for national defense but also for the
implementation of various peacetime operations including counter-terrorism measures[75]. In addition, the
importance of inter-theater mobility of permanent combat-ready troops[76] is also pointed out given the vastness
of the Russian territory.
The occupation of a Moscow theater by Chechen armed rebels in 2002 drove a movement to review
Russia’s security posture throughout the country. President Putin directed the Defense Minister and others to
review the National Security Concept. As of May 2007, however, the country has not yet announced the
revised Concept.

**2. Military Reform**
In Russia, the overall restructuring of its armed forces had been delayed after the collapse of the Soviet Union.
Since 1997, however, progress has been made in the modernization of military forces, including the reduction
of the number of soldiers, structural reforms, and development and introduction of new-type equipment and in
the improvement of combat readiness. The reduction of military personnel is coming to an end and no further
large-scale reduction is planned for the future[77]. In structural reforms, shift to three services and three
independent corps[78] and the integration of military districts have been almost completed. As for the
modernization of military forces, President Putin approved the state policy on military equipment for the period
from 2007 to 2015 and accordingly, approximately five trillion rubles will be spent in the development and
procurement of military equipment by 2015. At the same time, efforts are being made to create an integrated
order placement system. On the other hand, in order to improve the quality of military personnel and maintain
highly skilled forces, Russia is implementing measures toward the introduction of a contract-based service,
under which soldiers are recruited not by conscription but by contract[79]. Together with the ongoing
improvement of the permanent combat-ready troops, the contract-based service would contribute to the
improvement of the Russian military combat readiness. Also, Russia has been improving the military unit
command system, and Russia is thought to continue these measures to improve conventional armed forces
along with its efforts to maintain nuclear deterrent potential against the backdrop of the national defense budget
that has been increasing in recent years[80]. (See Fig. I-2-4-1)

**3. The Chechen Issue**
Triggered by the invasion of armed groups of Chechen rebels into the Republic of Dagestan in 1999, the armed
forces of the Russian Federation started military actions against the groups (the Second Chechen War). In April
2002, President Putin announced in his state of the union address that the military stage had already ended.
However, military actions by the Russian forces continued thereafter.
In the midst of this conflict, there were frequent terrorist attacks by armed groups, including the occupation
of a Moscow theater in October 2002 and the takeover of a school in the Republic of North Ossetia in
September 2004. President Putin enhanced mop-up operations against armed groups, and in 2006, established
the National Anti-Terrorism Committee (NAC) and enacted a new antiterrorism law. Also, Russia has been
promoting antiterrorism operations with the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and NATO members.
In the Chechen Republic, a new constitution was adopted in 2003 and a parliamentary election was held in
2005, and thus the federal government has been implementing measures to stabilize Chechen. Also, as a result
of mop-up operations by the government, leaders of pro-independence forces including Shamil Basayev, who
was thought to be an extreme hardliner, were killed. However, the armed Chechen rebels have not been
completely eliminated and it is difficult to tell what it will be in the future.

**3. External Relations**

**1. Relations with the United States**
The relationship between Russia and United States has been improved in various fields through cooperation in
fight against terrorism and other measures[81]. The United States, however, expresses concerns about domestic
affairs in Russia, while Russia expresses concerns regarding the U.S. foreign policies. Thus the two countries
have different stances[82].
The United States, which has been developing its ballistic missile defense program, withdrew from the
Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty in June 2002. Russia criticized the U.S. decision, but did not regard it as a
threat to Russia’s security. Subsequently, however, the United States agreed with the Czech Republic and
Poland to start full-scale negotiations to deploy part of its missile defense system to the countries, and Russia is
strongly opposed to this, claiming that the system targets Russia and would badly affect its nuclear deterrent
capabilities.
In pursuant to the Strategic Offense Reductions Treaty (the Moscow Treaty), which was signed in May
2002 and came into effect in June 2003, both the United States and Russia shall reduce the number of nuclear
warheads to between 1,700 and 2,200 by December 31, 2012. The treaty provides that each country shall
independently determine the composition and structure of their nuclear forces within its limits.

**2. Relations with the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)**
Russia promotes military integration with CIS member countries, claiming that its vital interests are
concentrated in the territories of the CIS. To this end, Russia has dispatched its federal forces to stay in
Ukraine, Georgia, Moldova, Armenia, Tajikistan, and Kyrgyz. It also concluded agreements to form a unified
air defense system or joint border security treaties with CIS member countries[83].
With increasing activities by Islamic armed forces in Central Asia/Caucasia, Russia pursued military
cooperation to fight against terrorism in the region, and organized a Collective Rapid Deployment Force[84] in
May 2001 within the framework of the CIS Collective Security Treaty Organization. Since the U.S. and other
military forces launched the military campaign in Afghanistan following the 9/11 terrorist attacks in September
2001 in the United States, Russia has not opposed the U.S. assistance to Uzbekistan, Kyrgyz, Tajikistan, and
Georgia or the U.S. military presence in these countries. On the other hand, in 2003, Russia established an air


-----

force base in Kyrgyz to enhance the CIS Collective Rapid Deployment Force[85]. Russia also had a division (of

October 2004 to secure a Russian military base in the country.
In the meantime, Georgia and Ukraine, both of which have new administrations that took office in 2003 to
2004, are aiming to strengthen their relations with Europe and the United States for their future accession to
NATO, even as they emphasize relations with Russia. In May 2005, Russia and Georgia decided through
negotiations that the Russian military base located in Georgian territory should be closed in 2008. As for
Ukraine, if the Russian Black Sea Fleet continues to stay in Ukraine, it may be a barrier to its future NATO
membership.

**3. Relations with NATO**
Russia, as a rule, has been against the accession to NATO of the former Soviet Union countries and the
countries of Central and Eastern Europe. However, it took steps to build a new cooperative relationship with
NATO especially after the 9/11 terrorist attacks in the United States, and a NATO-Russia Council was
established as a mechanism to pursue joint activities in May 2002. Within the framework of this Council,
Russia will participate in decision making to a certain extent and act as an equal partner in the fields of
common interest[86].

**4. Relations with Asian Countries**
Russia is implementing a pipeline project to transport Siberia oil to the Far East and developing natural gas
fields in Sakhalin. To develop these underground resources and revitalize its regional economy and social


-----

infrastructure, it is important for Russia to enhance economic relations with Asia-Pacific countries including
Japan and China. To this end, Russia emphasizes relations with these countries in its foreign policies and has
joined the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), and the Shanghai
Cooperation Organization (SCO) (see Section 3.1). Also, Russia signed the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation
in Southeast Asia (TAC) in 2004[87]. President Putin has been actively engaged in summit diplomacy with Asian
countries. For example, he has been maintaining close relationship with China and India through annual
reciprocal top-level visits. In July 2006, President Putin had a trilateral summit meeting with Chinese and India
leaders. Furthermore, due to the fact that regional peace and stability mean much to its national interests,
Russia intends proactively to get involved in the solution of regional problems, such as those concerning the
Korean Peninsula[88].

**5. Exportation of Arms**
Russia seems to be promoting the exportation of arms not only to maintain the infrastructure of the military
industry and make profit but also to help promote better foreign policies. The export value has been increasing
in recent years. In January 2007, the Russian government granted an exclusive right to export arms to the
Rosoboronexport State Corporation as part of its lasting efforts to improve the export system. In addition,
Russia regards the military industry as an integral part of the nation’s military organization and is committed to
improving and further developing the military industry by such measures as promoting the integration of
aircraft companies such as Sukhoi, MiG, and Tupolev.
Russia has exported jet fighters and warships to countries including China, India, and ASEAN member
countries[89]. In addition, Russia signed agreements on military technology cooperation with North Korea and
Iran in 2001. The international community is concerned about the possibility of an outflow of materials and
technologies related to weapons of mass destruction, such as nuclear weapons, as well as personnel having
knowledge and technology that are related to these weapons from former Soviet countries.

**4. Military Posture**

**1. Nuclear Forces**
Russia seems to have gradually reduced the number of its strategic nuclear missiles, and it also seems that
building of a new-type nuclear-powered ballistic missile-carrying submarine (SSBN) has fallen behind
schedule. However, Russia still maintains intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) and submarine-launched
ballistic missiles (SLMB) second only to the United States in scale. Although Russia totally abolished SS-24
missiles, which were only railway-mobile ICBMs, by the end of 2005, it decided to prolong the lifetime of its
old-type ICBMs. While the aging of its nuclear
missiles has been pointed out, Russia began to
accelerate the development and introduction of new
weapons, completed the test of the new mobile-type
Topol-M ICBM, and started its deployment in 2006.
Also, Russia started a flight test of the new-type
Bulava submarine-launched ballistic missile in
September 2005, but some point out that the test
failed in 2006. It seems that Russia has not yet
deployed the missile.
Pursuant to the aforementioned Moscow Treaty,
Russia and the United States shall reduce the number


-----

of their nuclear warheads to between 1,700 and 2,200 by December 31, 2012. The treaty raises international
attention regarding whether the future disposal of nuclear weapons, including cost issues, will proceed
smoothly[90]. On the other hand, after the United States withdrew from the ABM Treaty, Russia declared the
second Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START II) nullified, and said that it would take countermeasures
such as suspension of the disposal of multiple nuclear warhead missiles. In light of the fact that the first
Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START I) would become null and void in 2009, Russia proposed to start
negotiations about a new treaty to replace START I.
As for non-strategic nuclear forces, Russia had scrapped surface-launched short- and intermediate-range
missiles with a range of between 500 and 5,500 km by 1991 in accordance with the Intermediate-Range
Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, and had removed tactical nuclear weapons deployed aboard naval vessels and
stored them in onshore missile silos in the following year. Russia, however, still possesses a broad array of
nuclear forces.
Russia has been promoting modernization of its conventional forces. However, it has not progressed as
planned. Given this, and as is indicated by the detailed description of the use of nuclear weapons in the
Concept and the Doctrine, it is said that Russia emphasizes the importance of nuclear forces to make up for
deficiencies in its conventional forces, and is making efforts to maintain the readiness of its nuclear forces.

**2. Conventional Forces and Other Issues**
Since 1990, Russian conventional forces have been reduced in size, but on the other hand, it seems that Russia
is concentrating its limited resources on specific units to maintain their combat readiness[91].
However, many problems remain, including a decrease in the number of men available for conscription,
bad living conditions for military personnel, lax military discipline, and difficulties in securing military
personnel due to broad-ranging deferments and exemptions from military service. It would thus appear difficult
for Russia to maintain the same level of military activities as it was in the Soviet era[92].
The future of Russian forces is unclear due to the opacity of both the political and economic conditions in
the country, and it is necessary to continue monitoring the progress of military reform or Russian forces. It is,
however, unlikely in the foreseeable future that the size and posture of Russian forces would return to their
status during the Cold War era.

**5. Russian Forces in the Far East Region**

**1. General**
The present scale of the Russian military forces in the Far East region is much smaller than its peak. However,
Russia deploys ground forces of about 90,000[93], approximately 250 warships, and roughly 630 combat aircraft
in the Far East Region, and a considerable scale of military forces including nuclear forces still remains in the
region. Training operations, after reaching bottom, have been slightly increasing in recent years. Since 2003,
Russia has conducted military exercises in the Far East region, including “Vostok 2003” and “Vostok 2005,”
both of which were large-scale exercises, and “Mobility 2004,” which was an exercise for the country’s
permanent combat-ready troops to deploy from the western part of Russia to the Far East region.
In Russia, the number of troops has been reduced due to military reforms, and as a result, the personnel
vacancy rate of the troops is thought to be declining. However, only strategic nuclear units and permanent
combat-ready troops maintain a state of readiness, and the readiness of troops in general seems to be under
improvement now.
For the future of the Russian forces in the Far East region, it is necessary to continue to monitor the trend
of Russian forces as well as what they will be in the future, because, as a whole, the forces tend to focus on


-----

dealing with conflicts by inter-theater mobility of its combat-ready troops, and political and economic
conditions in the country still remain quite uncertain. It is, however, unlike in the foreseeable future that the
scale and posture of the Russian forces in the Far East region will return to what they were during the Cold
War era. Contexts for this argument are as follows: military détente with the United States has made it less
necessary for Russia to emphasize its military presence in the Pacific, and a reduction of military tension with
China has reduced the need for military vigilance against the country. (See Fig. I-2-4-3)

**(1) Nuclear Forces**
As for strategic nuclear forces in the Far East region, ICBMs, such as SS-25s and Tu-95MS Bear strategic
bombers are deployed along the Trans-Siberian Railway, and SSBNs, such as the Delta III-class nuclear
submarine carrying SLBMs, and others are deployed in and around the Sea of Okhotsk. The readiness of these
strategic nuclear forces appears to have been generally maintained. The effects of the Moscow Treaty, which
was signed between the United States and Russia in 2002, will have on strategic nuclear forces in the Far East
region should be followed.
As for non-strategic nuclear capabilities, Russian forces in the Far East Region have a variety of weapons,
including medium-range bombers such as Tu-22M Backfires and sea (undersea)-and air-launched cruise
missiles. A total of approximately 70 Backfires are deployed in the west of Lake Baikal and the coast areas
including the area across from Sakhalin.


-----

**(2) Ground Forces**
Ground forces in the Far East region have continuously shrunk since 1990 and are currently made up of 15
divisions of approximately 90,000 personnels.
Also, the Pacific Fleet of the Russian Navy has a naval infantry division with an amphibious capability.
(See Fig. I-2-4-4)

**(3) Naval Forces**
The Pacific Fleet is deployed from its main bases in Vladivostok and Petropavlovsk . The Fleet comprises
approximately 250 ships with a total displacement in the region of about 600,000 tons, including about 20 major
surface ships and about 20 submarines (about 15 of which are nuclear-powered submarines) with a total
displacement of approximately 280,000 tons. These forces have been scaled down since 1990. (See Fig. I-2-4-5)

**(4) Air Forces**
Russia deploys approximately 630 combat aircraft of its Air Force and Navy. This represents a drastic fall from
its peak, but existing models are being modified to improve their capabilities. (See Figs. I-2-4-6 • 7)

Since 1978 under the regime of the former Soviet Union, Russia has been redeploying ground troops on the
Kunashiri, Etorofu, and Shikotan Islands of Japan’s Northern Territories. These territories are illegally
occupied by Russia although they are integral part of Japanese territory. The number of Russia’s military
personnel in this region has been declining in recent years, and is considered to have far decreased from the
peak. However, tanks, armored vehicles, various types of artillery, and anti-air missiles are still deployed in the
region. With regard to ground forces in the Northern Territories, then President Yeltsin officially announced
during his visit to Japan in 1993 that half of the troops stationed on the four islands had already been
withdrawn and the remaining half, with the exception of the national boarder guard, would also be pulled out.
In the late 1990s, Russia repeatedly stated at various official meetings with Japan that the number of Russian
troops stationed in this region had been reduced. The number of Russian military personnel stationed in this
region in 1991 was approximately 9,500, but at the Japan-Russia summit meeting held in 1997, then Russian
Defense Minister Rodionov made it clear that the troops stationed in the Northern Territories had been reduced
to 3,500 soldiers by 1995. In July 2005, however, when then Russian Defense Minister Ivanov visited the
Northern Territories, he declared that Russia would not either increase or decrease the troops stationed on the
four islands, clearly showing the intention to keep the status quo.
As mentioned above, Russian troops continue to be stationed in the Northern Territories, which are an
integral part of Japanese territory, and it is hoped that the issue will be solved at an early date.


-----

**3. Operations in the Vicinity of Japan**
Russian military operations have remained generally quiet in the vicinity of Japan, including exercises and
training, as compared with those conducted by the former Soviet Union in the Cold War era. There are,
however, signs that such operations have started up again.
The number of exercises carried out by the Russian ground forces in areas adjacent to Japan decreased
sharply from the peak number, but some activities seem to have been reactivated.
With regard to naval vessels, there is a sign of change in the naval training and other activities. For
example, long sea training by submarines and surface ships was conducted for the first time in several years,
and nuclear submarines resumed their patrols.
Flights close to Japan’s territorial airspace, air exercises, and training seem to have reached bottom.

Section 5. Southeast Asia

**1 General Situation**
Southeast Asia is encompassed by the Straits of Malacca, the South China Sea, and the waters around
Indonesia and the Philippines, thus occupying a key strategic position for traffic by linking the Pacific and
Indian Oceans. The countries of this region have worked to achieve political stability and sound economic
progress while striving to deepen relations of interdependence with other countries both inside and outside the
region. However, this region still has unstable factors, including the territorial dispute over the Spratly Islands,
minority ethnic issues, separatist and independent movements, and Islamic extremist groups. Also, there are
incidents such as piracy by which the safe passage of ships was menaced. In response to these situations, the
countries in the region are trying to build sufficient military capabilities to deal with their security issues,
including antiterrorism measures and vigilance against pirates and armed robberies on the water. Also, they
have been modernizing their military forces, including the introduction of new warships to improve their naval
forces as well as the introduction of new-type fighters[94]. (See Fig. I-2-5-1)

In the region, multinational cooperation has also been promoted in order to deal with cross-border
problems as represented by terrorism and piracy. ASEAN countries have been continuously discussing
terrorism issues at various occasions. At the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) Ministerial Meeting in July 2006,
the ministers adopted the ARF Statement on Cooperation in Fighting Cyber Attack and Terrorist Misuse of
Cyber Space. In July 2004, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Singapore started the Trilateral Coordinated Patrols for


-----

vigilance against pirates and armed robberies in the Straits of Malacca and Singapore. For the patrols, the naval
forces of the three countries patrol their own territories while exchanging information. Subsequently in
September 2005, the countries launched their joint airborne patrols codenamed Eyes in the Sky. Since 2004,
Malaysia, Singapore, the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand have conducted combined joint
exercises including maritime interdiction training every year within the framework of the Five Powers Defence
Arrangements (FPDA). In addition, the Regional Cooperation Agreement on Combating Piracy and Armed
Robbery against Ships in Asia (ReCAAP)[95], which was proposed and promoted by Japan, entered into force in
September 2006 and the ReCAAP Information Sharing Centre was established in November 2006 in Singapore
based on the agreement.

**2. Cooperation with the United States in Security Issues**
Many Southeast Asian countries have conducted joint exercises with other countries both inside and outside the
region, including FPDA-based joint exercises. In addition, they have built cooperative relations in security with
the United States.
The United States regards Singapore as a Major Security Cooperation Partner. In July 2005, the two
nations signed the Strategic Framework Agreement between the United States of America and the Republic of
Singapore for a Closer Cooperation Partnership in Defense and Security, in order to strengthen the cooperation
in areas such as counter-terrorism, counter-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, defense technology,
joint military exercises and training, and policy dialogues.
The Philippines and the United States resumed their large-scale joint military exercise Balikatan in 2000. In
Balikatan 07 in February through March 2006 participated by about 1,200 Philippine military personnel and
about 400 U.S. military personnel, the two nations conducted command post exercises as well as support
activities for civilian reconstruction efforts in the areas such as the Sulu Archipelago.
Thailand and the United States started to hold a large-scale bilateral military exercise Cobra Gold in 1982.
This exercise has become multinational since 2000. In response to the military coup in Thailand in September
2006, the United States announced the suspension of military aid of about $24 million to Thailand. However,
the military exercise Cobra Gold 07 for 2007 was jointly organized by the United States and Thailand as usual.
In Cobra Gold 07 held in this May, the scope of the exercise includes a Field Training Exercise between the
Royal Thai Armed Forces and the U.S. Armed Forces and a non-combat purpose exercise such as Command
Post Exercise for PKO activities and Humanitarian/Civic Assistance around the exercise area[96].
In 2003, the United States granted Major Non-NATO Ally[97] status to the Philippines and Thailand.
For Indonesia, in response to Sumatra Earthquake and subsequent tsunami in the Indian Ocean, which
occurred in December 2004, the United States promptly dispatched USS Abraham Lincoln Carter Strike Group
to the devastated area, and played a key role in the relief activities conducted by many countries, in cooperation
with the Indonesian Armed Forces. Also, in February 2005, the United States expressed its intention to resume
the International Military Education and Training (IMET) program for Indonesia[98], which had been suspended
since 1992. Subsequently in November 2005, the United States decided to resume the exportation of weapons
to Indonesia.
For Vietnam, then Vietnamese Prime Minister Phan Van Khai visited the United States in June 2005 and
agreed with U.S. President George W. Bush to develop the bilateral relations to a new phase. In addition, the
leaders concluded an IMET agreement. The prime minister’s visit thus led to a great progress in military
cooperation between the two countries. In June 2006, then U.S. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld visited
Vietnam and agreed with then Vietnamese Defense Minister Pham Van Tra to expand military exchanges
between the two countries.


-----

Since 2000, the Multinational Planning and Argumentation Team (MPAT) program organized by the U.S.
Pacific Command, in which Southeast Asian nations, the United Nations and other international organizations
participate, has been conducted. This program is designed to prepare for contingencies such as large-scale
disasters where many countries would dispatch their troops for rescue operations. The purpose of the program
is to promote personnel exchanges and discussions on standard operating procedure in advance among those
who are expected to be dispatched. It is said that lessons learned from the MPAT program contributed to the
relief activities following Sumatra Earthquake and subsequent tsunami in the Indian Ocean.

**3. East Timor Situation**
In the East Timor, unfair treatment of soldiers from
the western side had developed into a political and
social conflict, which caused riot incidents in its
capital Dili in April 2006. Subsequently, in May
2006, military policemen deserted the national army
and attacked the national army headquarters to
aggravate the security. In response to the request
from the East Timor government, four countries, i.e.
Australia, New Zealand, Portugal, and Malaysia,
dispatched international security forces there at the
end of May 2006. Based on the adoption of Security
Council Resolution 1704, the United Nations
Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste (UNMIT), having
a mandate for such as support for presidential and
national parliament elections, recovery and maintenance of public order, and support for the reconstruction of
the security sector, was established in August 2006. The Mission is conducting activities in cooperation with
international security forces[99]. In April 2007, the first presidential election since the independence of the
country was held, and as a result of the subsequent runoff vote in May then Prime Minister Ramos Horta was
elected President.

**4. Spratly Islands**
The Spratly Islands are located in the central part of the South China Sea and comprise some 100 islets and
reefs. Undersea resources such as oil and natural gas are thought to exist in areas around the islands, besides
abundant fishery resources. The islands also occupy an important strategic position for maritime traffic. At
present, China, Taiwan, and Vietnam are laying territorial claim to the whole of the Spratly Islands, and the
Philippines, Malaysia, and Brunei are claiming part of them. In 1988, the Chinese and Vietnamese navies had
armed clashes over rights to the Spratly Islands. Although the clashes temporarily raised tensions, there have
been no major military clashes since then. Chinese actions, however, such as the enactment of the Territorial
Waters Law in 1992, the building of structures on Mischief Reef in 1995, and the subsequent extension of work
on the buildings on Mischief Reef have drawn strong opposition from the countries involved. Also, there are
many differences in opinions among ASEAN member countries, as exemplified by the Philippines’ protest in
1999 against Malaysia building new structures on the reefs of the islands.
China had previously insisted on bilateral negotiations on this issue, but recently, there have been signs of
an impetus to find a peaceful solution to the dispute among all of the countries involved. The ARF Ministerial
Conference each year has adopted a chairman’s statement to the effect that it welcomes efforts by all sides to
find a peaceful solution to the problem, and ASEAN member countries drafted the Regional Code of Conduct


-----

in the South China Sea that includes prohibition of any new occupation of uninhabited features in the sea[100]. On
the other hand, at the ASEAN-China Summit Meeting held in November 2002, ASEAN member countries and
China signed the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea[101], which aims for a peaceful
settlement of the territorial issues of the South China Sea through dialogue.
Recently, China has aggressively proposed to the related countries that they give priority to the
development of resources in the sea areas surrounding the Spratly Islands, apart from the territorial issue. For
example, in September 2004, China agreed with the Philippines on the joint oil field survey in the sea areas,
and in March 2005, China, the Philippines, and Vietnam reached an agreement on the launch of joint survey on
oil and natural gas in the South China Sea. Furthermore, ASEAN and China agreed to establish a joint working
group on resources development in the South China Sea and the agreement was approved by the ASEAN
Foreign Ministers’ Meeting held in July 2005. The countries concerned, however, still have conflicting
opinions regarding the territorial rights over the South China Sea including the Spratly Islands, and attention
must be given to the actions of the countries involved and the developments on consultations to resolve the
issue.

Section 6. South Asia

**1. India**

**1. General Situation**
India is surrounded by many countries and has long
coastlines totaling 7,600 km. The country has the
world’s second largest population of more than one
billion following China and has great influence in the
South Asian region. Also, it has a geographic
position that is significant in maritime traffic,
connecting the Asia-Pacific region with the Middle
East and Europe. In particular, Andaman and Nicobar
Islands located at the east end of the country are in
the proximity to the Straits of Malacca, and India is
greatly expected to play an important role in
maritime security.
India has multiple races, religions, languages,
and cultures within it, but it has an administration
elected through free and fair elections under the multi-party system and is the world’s largest democratic
nation[102]. Also, India shares a lot with major developed countries including Japan in terms of fundamental
values and systems, such as liberalism, democracy, and market economy.
India has been promoting economic liberalization and reform since the 1990s and maintaining high
economic growth rates. Some estimate that the number of its middle-income group reaches 300 million. In
recent years, the information technology (IT) industry has been showing a remarkable growth in India. Against
the backdrop of these favorable economic tendencies, the country actively engages in multilateral diplomacy,
thereby steadily increasing its presence in international society.

**2. National Defense Policy**
India, as its national security policies, lists the possession of military capabilities to protect the national interest
and the minimum level deterrent against nuclear threats; response to various security challenges ranging from
terrorism, low-intensity conflicts, to conventional wars and nuclear wars; and enhancement of international
cooperation to deal with new threats such as terrorism and weapons of mass destruction.
India intends to maintain minimum credible nuclear deterrence while committing to no first use on nuclear
weapons and maintaining a unilateral moratorium (temporary suspension) on nuclear tests that it announced
immediately after the nuclear test conducted in 1998. In addition, in its nuclear doctrine released in January
2003, India expressed its commitment to continuing to control the export of nuclear weapons and missilerelated materials and technologies and participating in the Fissile Material Cut-off Treaty negotiations, as well
as to creating a nuclear-free world. On the other hand, the doctrine declares that India will retain the option of
retaliating with nuclear weapons in the event of a major attack against India by biological or chemical
weapons.
Indian Armed Forces include ground forces of 12 corps with approximately 1,100,000 personnel; naval
forces of two fleets, totaling approximately 354,000 tons; and air forces of 19 combat air wings and others with
roughly 990 combat aircraft. India currently possesses one aircraft carrier, and in addition to promoting the


-----

construction plan of one new domestic aircraft carrier, will introduce another aircraft carrier from Russia upon
completion of repair work as explained later.

**3. Foreign Policies**

**(1) United States**
India is actively striving to strengthen bilateral relations with the United States, while the United States is also
promoting the expansion of its involvement in India in line with the economic growth of India, thus leading to
increasingly stronger interactive relationship in various fields.
The U.S.-India joint declaration, which was made when then Indian Prime Minister Vajpayee visited the
United States in November 2001, confirmed that qualitative improvement should be made for future bilateral
relations. In January 2004, the two countries announced that they had agreed to expand mutual cooperation in
the following three areas; civil nuclear activities, space programs, and high-technology trade, aiming to form
strategic partnership between the two countries. In July 2005, Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh visited
the United States and made a joint statement with U.S. President George W. Bush that the relationship between
the two countries would transform into a global partnership, through which they will cooperate in the field of
space exploration, nuclear energy for civilian applications, and military and non-military technologies.
Subsequently in March 2006, President Bush, in turn, visited India for the first time in six years as a president
of the United States[103], and agreed with Prime Minister Singh to strategically strengthen bilateral relations.
In the security field, in June 2005, then Indian Defense Minister Pranab Mukherjee and then U.S. Defense
Secretary Donald Rumsfeld signed a 10-year military agreement the New Framework for the U.S.-India
Defense Relationship, based on the recognition that the U.S.-India defense relationship is an important pillar in
the mutually beneficial relations between the two countries, which are changing over times. Furthermore, in
March 2006, the U.S. Department of Defense announced its intention to enhance cooperation with India in
security issues, including maritime security[104].
India and the United States have made active military exchanges, including joint military exercises. The
Indian and the U.S. navies carried out the joint naval exercise Malabar 06 off the coast of Goa in the Arabian
Sea from October through November 2006. The exercise was participated in by one amphibious assault ship of
the U.S. Navy, and Indian army soldiers and U.S. marines carried out the amphibious landing exercise, thus
making the joint exercise with the United States increasingly enhanced both in quality and quantity[105].
As for cooperation in civilian nuclear activities, U.S. President George W. Bush changed its previous
policy prohibiting cooperation with the countries not participating in the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of
Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and agreed in July 2005 with Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on cooperation
in civilian nuclear activities with India, which had conducted nuclear tests without participating in the NPT.
Subsequently, in March 2006, U.S. President Bush agreed with Indian Prime Minister Singh on the
implementation of cooperation in civilian nuclear activities. Furthermore, in December 2006, the U.S. Senate
and Congress passed the U.S.-India Peaceful Atomic Energy Cooperation Act, which enables cooperation in
civilian nuclear activities with India, where comprehensive safeguards by the International Atomic Energy
Agency (IAEA) were not applied. The act was signed by President Bush and enacted in the same month.
Meanwhile, coordination with the guidelines of the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) and others are required for
international cooperation in civilian nuclear activities with India.

**(2) China**
India has been trying to improve relations with China through mutual visits by leaders despite the national
border issues between them and concerns over Chinese nuclear weapons and missiles and modernization of


-----

military forces including naval ones. In June 2003, then Indian Prime Minister Vajpayee visited China for the
first time in the past ten years as an Indian prime minister and signed with Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao
the Declaration on Principles for Relations and Comprehensive Cooperation[106] between the Republic of India
and the People’s Republic of China. In November 2003, Indian and Chinese navies carried out joint naval
exercise off the coast of Shanghai for the first time. Furthermore, when Chinese Minister of National Defense
Cao Gangchuan visited India in March 2004, the two countries agreed on the expansion of military exchanges.
Subsequently in December 2004, based on this agreement, a visit to China by an Indian Chief of Army Staff
was made for the first time in approximately 10 years. Also in January 2005, a strategic dialogue was held for
the first time by the two countries’ Vice Foreign Ministers. When Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao visited
India in April 2005, the two countries reached an agreement on establishing strategic and cooperative
partnership for peace and prosperity[107]. In November 2006, Chinese President Hu Jintao visited India for the
first time in the past ten years as a Chinese president to meet with Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.
Both agreed that the development of strategic and cooperative partnership between China and India is
commonly recognized as an important issue and announced a joint declaration that includes holding regular
summit meetings[108].

**(3) Russia**
India has traditionally been on friendly terms with Russia and maintains close relations with the country
through mutual visits made annually by their leaders. In October 2000, the two countries signed the Declaration
of Strategic Partnership to further strengthen their bilateral relations, and have been promoting acquisition of T90 tanks by India from Russia and joint development of supersonic cruise missile[109]. In January 2007, Russian
President Vladimir Putin visited India and both leaders announced a joint statement as well as signed
agreements, including the one for constructing nuclear power plants and the intergovernmental agreement on
the peaceful use of the Global Navigation Satellite System GLONASS[110].
Russia is a major provider of weapons for India[111]. In January 2004, then Russian Defense Minister Ivanov
visited India and concluded a contract to sell a retired aircraft carrier, the Admiral Gorshkov, to India. Also in
January 2007, then Russian Defense Minister Ivanov visited India and conducted a consultation meeting on
military technology cooperation, joint exercises, and other issues[112].
Also, the two countries have conducted joint military exercises since 2003[113].

**(4) Asian Countries**
Since the latter half of the 1990s, India has been emphasizing relations with East Asian countries including
ASEAN members. In October 2003, it signed the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia (TAC).[114]

India, which has been historically on good terms with Japan, has been deepening cooperation with Japan in
economy, security, and various other fields based on a global partnership.
In May 2006, then India’s Defense Minister Mukherjee visited Japan and announced a joint statement with
the Director General on the DFAA Nukaga. In this statement, the two countries agreed to deepen talks and
cooperation in the field on defense cooperation.

**2. Pakistan**
Pakistan, with approximately 150 million people, borders India, Iran, Afghanistan, and China, and is one of the
most geopolitically important countries in Southwestern Asia. Currently, Pakistan’s attitude towards
international fight against terrorism and nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction is attracting
international attention.


-----

Pakistan, which has no nuclear umbrella, claims that maintaining nuclear deterrence against the nuclear
threat posed by India is essential to ensure national security and self defense.
The Pakistan Armed Forces include ground forces of 9 corps with approximately 550,000 personnel; one
naval fleet of about 45 warships, totaling approximately 81,000 tons; and air forces including 12 air combat
wings with a total of roughly 370 combat aircraft. (See Fig. I-2-6-1)

Pakistan, while attaching importance to friendship and cooperation with Islamic countries, maintains close
relations with China as a countermeasure against India[115]. Since the 9/11 attacks on the United States, Pakistan
has been expressing its intention to join the U.S.-led fight against terrorism[116]. This cooperative attitude was
highly appreciated by the international community, and the sanctions that had been imposed on Pakistan by the
United States and other countries due to Pakistan’s nuclear test in 1998 were lifted[117]. Pakistan strengthened
military cooperation with the United States in the fight against terrorism. In March 2005, the United States
decided to sell F-16 fighters to Pakistan, lifting its freeze on the sale that had been lasting for more than 20
years. Furthermore in March 2006, U.S. President Bush visited Pakistan and highly appreciated Pakistan’s
support in the global fight against terrorism, and the two countries confirmed their policy to promote terrorismrelated information sharing[118].
For the nuclear proliferation issue involving Pakistan, President Musharraf disclosed in February 2004 that
some Pakistani scientists, including Doctor A.Q. Kahn, were involved in nuclear proliferation, though the
president denied the Pakistani government’s involvement in any kind of proliferation activity[119].
President Musharraf has been improving relations with India, including Kashmir issue, and also expressed
his support for the U.S.-led antiterrorism measures and prevention of weapons of mass destruction. Islamic
extremist groups both at home and abroad criticized president Musharraf’s policy, and in December 2003, there
were two assassination attempts on the president[120].
Achieving stability in Pakistan is crucial from the viewpoint of enhancing the international fight against
terrorism, preventing proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and securing stability in South Asia.

**3. India-Pakistan Conflict**
India and Pakistan, which became independent from the former British India after the World War II, had three
large armed conflicts over Kashmir territorial issue and others[121].


-----

In 1947, Indian and Pakistani forces clashed over Kashmir, which developed into a large armed conflict.
(This first war lasted until 1949.) After the second armed conflict (in 1965) and the third one (in 1971), the
current Line of Control (LOC) was defined in 1972.
The territorial dispute over Kashmir has continued, while dialogues were resumed and suspended
repeatedly, and it constitutes one of the root causes of confrontation between India and Pakistan. Military
tension between the two countries sharply increased following the Kargil conflict in 1999 and an attack on the
Indian Parliament in 2001. The situation, however, was not further aggravated due to efforts by the
international community, which was strongly concerned about the two countries, because both of them made
their possession of nuclear capabilities clear. In February 2004, the two countries commenced a process of a
composite dialog to normalize their relations, including those related to Kashmir issue. A certain degree of
progress has been made so far, including the start of the operation in April 2005 of direct buses across the LOC
in the Kashmir region[122].
In October 2005, a major earthquake occurred in Pakistan, with its epicenter located near the LOC in
Kashmir. More than 73,000 people were killed by the earthquake in Pakistan and the country suffered
devastating damage. Pakistan and India transported relief materials from India to Pakistan by air. Also, direct
telephone call service was made available and five crossing points were opened on the LOC. The two
governments thus implemented ground breaking measures in Kashmir following the earthquake.
Also, as part of its peace promoting measures, India withdrew some of its forces stationed in Kashmir in
November 2004 and it announced a step-by-step reduction of these forces (by 15,000 personnel in total) again
in February 2006.
India and Pakistan had far different opinions on Kashmir and the solution of the issues was thought to be
difficult. However, tension between the two countries is further mitigated, and whether they may solve the
issue is attracting much attention from the international community.
The two countries are confronted with each other also in such fields as nuclear and ballistic missile
development. Neither country is party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) or the
Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT)[123]. In 1998, they conducted a series of nuclear tests, which
drew criticism from the international community, including Japan[124].
In more recent years, both countries have been actively promoting the development of ballistic missiles and
cruise missiles that can carry nuclear warheads. India announced the deployment of Agni 2 intermediate range
ballistic missiles to its ground forces in September 2003. The Agni 3 intermediate range ballistic missile was
test-launched in April 2007, which was reportedly successful. Furthermore, it is reported that Brahmos
supersonic cruise missiles, which were developed jointly with Russia, are now being deployed to naval
warships.
Pakistan, on the other hand, first test-launched the Babur (Hataf VII) cruise missile in November 2005[125]. It
also conducted the test-launched of the Shaheen 2 (Hataf VI) intermediate range ballistic missile in February
2007. Furthermore, in the exercise of the Army Strategic Force Command (ASFC), the Strategic Missile Group
(SMG) consecutively conducted the first exercise launch of missiles it owns, such as the Ghauri intermediate
range ballistic missile (Hataf V) and the Shaheen 1 (Hataf V) intermediate range ballistic missile from
November through December in 2006[126]. This seems to demonstrate that Pakistan is steadily deploying ballistic
missile to forces.


-----

Section 7. Australia

Australia, as well as Japan and the Republic of Korea, has an alliance with the United States. As seen in its
engagement in the North Korea, East Timor and other issues, Australia has actively been involved in resolution
of Asia and Pacific security issues. (See Part III, Chapter 3, Section 2)
In December 2000, Australia announced “Defence 2000-Our Future Defence Force”, which presented its
defense policy for the coming decade. The document states that the Australian Defence Force has three
missions: First, to defend Australia; Second, to contribute to the security of neighboring countries; and Third,
to contribute effectively to international coalition forces to meet crises beyond Australia’s neighboring
countries to support Australia’s wider interests and objectives. Having reviewed its national defense strategy in
terms of security environment influenced by the 9/11 terrorist attacks, and by the bombing in Bali, Indonesia,
in October 2002, Australia released “Australia’s National Security: A Defence Update 2003” in February 2003,
which focuses on such issues as the expanded use of its armed forces in remote areas to deal with terrorism and
the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
In December 2005, based on the strategic
principles stated in “Defence 2000” and “A Defence
Update 2003,” Australia announced “Australia’s
National Security: A Defence Update 2005.” This
report sets priorities in Australia’s security strategy to
deal with threats of terrorism, proliferation of
weapons of mass destruction, and problems of failing
states. Also, the report mentions that it remains
unlikely that Australia will face conventional military
threats, but there is a continuing need for military
capabilities to address current international security

An Australian soldier providing training to Iraqi soldiers [Australian Department of Defence] issues such as those in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Furthermore, based on a recognition that
globalization has a significant impact on security policy-related decision making and that countries in AsiaPacific region, especially in North East Asia, are increasing their military capabilities, Australia deems it
necessary to build a defense capability that is versatile and adaptable, and easy to link with other arms of
Australian government, and to build strong security relationships both regionally and globally through
international contribution. Together with the new report, the Australian Department of Defence announced that
it will enhance its army with additional 1,500 personnel in 10 years; however, it decided in August 2006 to
further increase 2,600 personnel in the army in line with the necessity of contributing to the stability of the
region and responding to terrorism.
Australia, attaching importance to its alliance with the United States, has concluded the ANZUS Treaty
(the Security Treaty between Australia, New Zealand and the United States of America[127]) and conducted joint
exercises, such as Talisman Sabre. Also, Australia and the United States hold Australia-United States
Ministerial Consultations (AUSMIN) every year[128]. Following the 9/11 terrorist attacks, Australia decided to
invoke Article 4 of the said Treaty, which specifies the right of collective self-defense, and dispatched
warships, combat aircraft, and special forces in order to support the U.S. forces conducting counter-terrorism
operations. In the military operations against Iraq that started in March 2003, Australia also dispatched
warships, combat aircraft, and special forces, and, as of May 2007, deploys about 1,580 personnel in Iraq to
assist reconstruction activities.


-----

Seeking to enhance interoperability with the United States, Australia decided to participate in the U.S.-led
missile defense program in December 2003, but concrete form of participation is still under discussion. In
August 2004, Australia determined to adopt the U.S. Aegis system to its new air warfare destroyers. It has also
participated in the U.S.-led F-35 Joint Strike Fighter Program, expecting F/A-18 and F-111, both of which are
its main fighters, to retire in the coming several years, and upgraded the U.S.-Australia joint training facilities
in Australia[129].
Australia also conducts joint exercises with Malaysia, Singapore, the United Kingdom and New Zealand
based on the Five Power Defense Arrangements (which came into effect in 1971). In addition, Australia took
part in U.N. PKOs, such as United Nations Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste (UNMIT).
In terms of relations with Indonesia, Australia has provided the country with cooperation to enhance its
counterterrorism capacity after the Bali terrorist bombing in October 2002. However, another terrorist bombing
occurred in front of the Australian Embassy in Jakarta in September 2004 and another in Bali in October 2005,
and both countries agreed to resume joint exercises between their respective special forces in December
2005[130]. Furthermore, in November 2006, both countries signed the security agreement, which states
cooperation in a wide range of fields, including defense, counterterrorism, and intelligence, to aim at
strengthening cooperation and consultation on issues affecting their individual or common security.


-----

Section 8. Europe

**1. General Situation**
Many European countries recognize that the threat of a large scale invasion by another nation has disappeared.
At the same time, new security issues potentially affecting Europe have been identified, including regional
conflicts, the rise of international terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
Following the end of the Cold War, European countries have been striving to stabilize the security situation
through efforts to enhance and expand the frameworks of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO: 26
member states) and the European Union (EU: 27 member states). In addition, many European countries have
been making efforts to improve the capabilities to respond to aforementioned new issues, while reducing and
rationalizing their armed forces. (See Fig. I-2-8-1)

**2. Enhancement and Enlargement of Security Frameworks**

**1. Enhancement of Conflict Prevention, Crisis Management, and Peacekeeping Functions**

**(1) Commitment to a New Role**
Founded for the primary purpose of collective
defense among member countries, NATO has shifted
the focus of its activities to conflict prevention and
crisis management since the end of the Cold War.
This shift is reflected in the Strategic Concept of
the Alliance, reviewed in 1999, in which missions
such as conflict prevention and crisis management[131]

are added to its primary task of collective defense,
based on the view that various dangers difficult to
forecast, such as ethnic and religious conflicts,
territorial disputes, human rights suppression, and the
dissolution of a state, still remain in Europe and
surrounding regions.

Japanese Prime Minister Abe at the NATO Council

NATO has led the International Security [Cabinet Public Relations Office]
Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan since
August 2003, which is the first operation outside Europe, and expanded the area of its operations to the entire
Afghanistan in October 2006. The NATO Summit held in Riga, Latvia in November 2006 adopted the joint
statement that the contribution to the peace and stability of Afghanistan is its first priority[132].
For Iraq, NATO has provided assistance for the training of Iraqi security forces in accordance with an
agreement reached at the NATO Istanbul Summit Meeting held in June 2004.
As NATO thus expands and prolongs its operations, problems are pointed out, including shortage in force
and tight financial conditions of NATO.
On the other hand, the EU, enhancing its own commitment to security issues, adopted its first document on
security strategy, _A Secure Europe in a Better World-European Security Strategy, in December 2003. This_
document regarded terrorism, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, regional conflicts, state failure, and
organized crimes as serious threats and showed the policies to be taken to deal with these challenges by
stabilizing the surrounding area’s situation and based on multinational cooperation.
The EU, in 2003, for the first time led a military operation to maintain public order in Macedonia using
NATO equipment and capabilities[133]. In the same year, the EU carried out its first peacekeeping operation
(PKO) outside Europe and its first operation without using NATO equipment and capabilities in Democratic
Republic of Congo. In recent years, the EU has engaged in activities in the areas of crisis management and
security maintenance[134], such as taking over in December 2004 the activities of the Stabilization Force (SFOR)
deployed to Bosnia-Herzegovina under NATO leadership.

**(2) Pursuit of Military Capabilities Required for New Roles**
NATO’s bombing campaign conducted against Yugoslavia in 1999 revealed a capability gap between the
United States and European countries. Given this, and based on the agreement reached at the NATO Prague
Summit Meeting held in November 2002, NATO has moved forward with reforms of its military capabilities,
including organizational transformation[135].


-----

As the core of NATO transforms to improve its capability, the launching of the NATO Response Force
(NRF), designed to respond swiftly to various types of crisis scenarios across the world, had started since 2002.
The Force was declared to be at full operational capability in November 2006 and performs operations utilizing
its special capabilities. For example, it transported relief materials when a large earthquake occurred in
Pakistan in October 2005.
The EU has tried to become capable of conducting peacekeeping and other military operations
independently in cases where NATO does not involve itself. The EU adopted Headline Goal 2010, and
positioned the Battle groups concept as the core of its future military approaches in 2004. (See Fig. I-2-8-2)

**Fig. I-2-8-2 Trend of Capability Build-up of NATO and EU**

|Col1|NATO Response Force (NRF)|EU Battle Groups (Combat Groups)|
|---|---|---|
|Missions|Swiftly responding every situation worldwide|Responding EU-led missions, such as peacekeeping operations, in the case where there is no intervention by NATO.|
|Organization|• Standing joint task forces formed by mainly brigade-scale ground units (approx. 4,000 troops), plus maritime, air and specialized units • Size of force: approx. 25,000 troops|• Thirteen units of 1,500 troops will be formed. Of these, two units can be emergency deployed simultaneously.|
|Capabilities|• Deployment begins within five days of an order. • Capability of 30-day operations|• Deployment begins within five days of an order and is completed within 15 days. • Capability of 30-day operations|
|Operations|• One year rotation (in the case of ground units, six months training and six months on standby) • Basic operational concept: to be dispatched as an initial response unit • Segmentation of units is possible according to the mission|• Units will be formed and on standby by rotation within the unilateral or multinational framework.|
|Force building|• Initiative was formulated in November 2002. • Prototype force was formed in October 2003. • Possession of initial operational capability in October 2004 • Complete operational capability was achieved in November 2006.|• Initiative was formulated in June 2004. • Complete operational capability was achieved in January 2007.|



The EU also set up the European Defense Agency in July 2004 with the goal of improving the defense
capabilities of individual countries within a European-wide security defense policy. At the meeting of
Ministers of Defense held in March 2006, the ministers agreed that European Defense Agency will examine the
establishment of a fund for research and development. It is, however, pointed out that, due to such a fact that
seven countries expressed their intention not to participate, there is friction with member states that lead this
concept.

**2. Stability by the Geographical Expansion of Security Frameworks**
Since the end of the Cold War, efforts have been made to secure the stability of the so-called security vacuum
in Central and Eastern Europe by enlarging the NATO framework.


-----

NATO adopted the Partnership for Peace (PfP) in 1994[136], under which training exercises for PKOs and
response to refugee problems have been conducted.
In 1994, the Organization initiated the Mediterranean Dialogue to contribute to stability in the
Mediterranean region by provision of information and participation of Dialogue countries in NATO activities.
In addition, the 9/11 attacks in the United States promoted NATO and Russia to take steps to build a new
relationship from the need to address common security issues. Accordingly, it was decided to establish the
NATO-Russia council at the NATO-Russia Summit held in May 2002.
With seven countries (Rumania, Slovenia, Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia, Bulgaria, and Slovakia) becoming
new members in March 2004, nearly all countries of Central and Eastern Europe have now joined NATO.
In a parallel development, 10 countries from Central and Eastern Europe (Poland, Hungary, Czech,
Slovakia, Slovenia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, and Cyprus) joined the EU in May 2004, and Bulgaria
and Rumania in January 2007. (See Fig. I-2-8-3)

**3. Efforts by Individual Countries to Maintain the Capability to Respond to Various**
**Conditions**

European nations attract more importance to military missions other than home defense, baring terrorism,
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and other new threats in mind. In defense build-up, they
emphasize transport capability for overseas deployment given their roles in NATO.

**1. The United Kingdom**
The defense policy of the United Kingdom is based on the 1998 Strategic Defense Review (SDR).
In this document, the United Kingdom defined the tasks of its military forces such as peacetime security
(support against terrorism of all kinds); security of the overseas territories; responses to crises both inside and


-----

outside the NATO area, and has been committed specifically to reductions of nuclear forces, enhancement of
joint combat capabilities, improvements in NBC protection, increase of mobility and striking power,
improvements in service life, and greater efficiency in weapons/equipment procurement and others. In the
wake of the 9/11 attacks, A New Chapter was added to the SDR in July 2002, which provides guidelines for
dealing with international terrorism.
In December 2003, the United Kingdom released a defense white paper, Delivering Security in a Changing
_World. It attracts attention that this white paper names international terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of_
mass destruction, and failed states as major threats, and at the same time, emphasizes the need to strengthen
overseas deployment capabilities, to improve readiness, and to make further reforms, based on lessons from
military operations in Iraq[137]. According to the report on specific future military capabilities released in July
2004, even while pursuing force reduction and consolidating its major military and naval facilities, the United
Kingdom plans to enhance its ability to carry out target acquisition and attacks swiftly and accurately, to
improve its ground fighting capabilities so that it can more effectively conduct small- to medium-scale
operations, and to advance its anti-surface strike capabilities by upgrading its aircraft carriers and landing
ships. In the aftermath of the terrorist bombings in London in July 2005, the United Kingdom formed the
Special Forces Support Group (SFSG) against the terrorism.
In December 2006, the British government published a white paper titled _The Future of the United_
_Kingdom’s Nuclear Deterrent to indicate the policy to maintain nuclear deterrent based on the submarine-_
launched ballistic missile system beyond the 2020s[138]. The white paper also describes efforts for nuclear
disarmament, including the decision to reduce operational nuclear warheads from 200 or less to 160 or less.

**2. Germany**
The German White Paper of Defense was published after the interval of 12 years in October 2006. It states that
the main mission of the German Federal Armed Forces continues to be home defense and the collective
defense in traditional terms; however, that the mission most likely to come next will be conflict prevention and
crisis management, including the combat against international terrorism, considering the current situation that
new threats, such as international terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, are
expanding.
Germany is committed to using resources focusing on the enhancement of such capabilities as strategic
transportation, global-scale reconnaissance, and efficient and highly interoperable command in order for the
capabilities of Federal Armed Forces to meet the above mission, and moves ahead with concrete plans to
introduce A-400M transport aircraft and the synthetic aperture radar satellite SAR-LUPE. Also, Germany is
promoting the plan to restructure its military into integrated forces with the three functions of intervention,
stabilization, and assistance[139]. In addition, efforts are made to reduce the total number of personnel and to
relocate bases and facilities within Germany.

**3. France**
Nuclear deterrence, conflict prevention, overseas deployment of forces, and home defense (e.g.
counterterrorism) are the core elements in France’s defense strategy under its recognition that mass terror and
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction are a direct threat to French people.
France is building up its military capabilities based on the Model of the Army in 2015 which was released
in February 1996. Conscription was abolished and the military forces were reduced in accordance with the
Military Program Law for 1997-2002. Now, based on the Military Program Law for 2003-2008, France plans
to focus investments on the enhancement and improvement of command and intelligence functions,
deployment and mobility capabilities, action and striking capabilities in depth, defensive means, and others. To


-----

be specific, the plan includes the order of unmanned reconnaissance aircraft and the acquisition of A-400M
transport aircraft, Rafale fighter aircraft, and Leclerc tanks as well as the construction of a conventionally
powered aircraft carrier in cooperation with the United Kingdom[140].

**4. Efforts toward Stabilization in Europe**

**1. Arms Control and Disarmament**
The Treaty of Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE), which formally entered into force in 1992, set
upper limits for five categories of weapons—tanks, wheeled armored combat vehicles, artillery, fighters, and
attack helicopters—for both East and West[141], and stipulates that weapons in excess to these limits should be
eliminated. Under the treaty, more than 70,000 weapons of various types have already been eliminated.
Subsequently, given the changed strategic environment in Europe, the CFE application treaty was signed at
the OSCE summit meeting in 1999, which transformed the earlier limits for the East and West as groups into
limits for individual countries and territories[142].

**2. Confidence Building Measures (CBM)[143]**

Talks on Confidence and Security-Building Measures (CSBM) have been held in Europe since 1989, and a
plenary meeting of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) in 1992 adopted the Vienna
Document 1992, which deals with annual exchanges of military intelligence as well as the notification,
inspection, and regulation of military exercises above the prescribed scale[144].
The Open Skies Treaty[145], designed to improve the openness and transparency of military activities carried
out by signatory countries and to supplement arms control verification measures by allowing reciprocal aerial
inspections, was signed by 25 countries in 1992 and entered into force in January 2002.

Section 9. Efforts to Stabilize the International Community by the U.N. and Other
Scheme

**1. General**
With the end of the Cold War, expectations grew on the role of the U.N. in peacekeeping, which had not been
well played in the past. To respond to these expectations, the U.N. launched a number of peacekeeping
operations (PKO). Recently, as new approaches to deal with conflicts in a proper manner, the African Union
(AU) and other regional frameworks (see Chapter 1) have been playing an important role, and multinational
forces, mandated by the relevant U.N. Security Council resolutions, have been conducting humanitarian and
reconstructing assistance activities. (See Chapter 1) Thus, various international frameworks have been adopted
to contribute to the stability of the situation. Under these circumstances, discussions are underway on
organizational and other reforms of the U.N. to deal effectively with diversified problems. Reforms of U.N.
organs in ways that increase their effectiveness and credibility are necessary for the international community to
adequately address new issues of the 21st century, and Japan is actively involved in these reform efforts.

**2. Developments in U.N. Peacekeeping Operations (PKOs)**
U.N. PKOs have traditionally been conducted with the main purpose of preventing the recurrence of armed
conflicts through activities such as monitoring ceasefires after ceasefires have been agreed. After the end of the
Cold War, however, U.N. PKOs grew in scale as the scope of PKO missions expanded to include monitoring
disarmament and civilian activities such as elections, monitoring governments, and humanitarian supports
including repatriating refugees. Additionally, the U.N. is now engaging itself in disarmament and other
activities in which it is allowed to take coercive measures as well as activities to prevent the outbreak of armed
conflicts under Chapter VII of the U.N. Charter. As of the end of April 2007, 15 PKO missions are underway,
participated in by approximately 83,000 people from 115 countries.
U.N. PKOs have problems such as shortage and security of personnel and instruments[146], therefore U.N.
and related states have been discussing about measures for solution.
“A more secure world: Our shared responsibility,” a report released by the U.N. High-Level Committee in
December 2004, requires developed states in particular to increase units for peace operations, because they
need to almost double the number of personnel to conduct effective peacekeeping operations in existing
conflicts. Also the report proposed the creation of a Peacebuilding Commission, standby arrangement in
brigade level, and composition of permanent police department for PKO. Among these proposals, the creation
of a Peacebuilding Commission was decided at the end of 2005 and the first meeting was held in June 2006.

**Notes**
1) While the U.S. President is required to submit the National Security Strategy to the Congress every year
in accordance with Section 404a, title 50 of the United States Code, the release of the National Security
Strategy in 2006 was the second submission by the Bush Administration following the one in September
2002.
2) The QDR is a document that Secretary of Defense is required to submit to the Congress every four years
according to Section 118, title 10 of the United States Code. It foresees the security environment in the
next 20 years and clarifies issues including the national defense strategy, force structure, force
modernization plan, defense infrastructure, and budget plan. The release of the 2006 QDR is the second
submission by the Bush Administration following the one in September 2001.
3) The National Defense Strategy is a document released by the Secretary of Defense in March 2005 as a
guide to implement the National Security Strategy as well as the basis of the QDR published in March
2006.
4) The Transformation Planning Guidance (April 2003) defines transformation as a “a process that shapes
the changing nature of military competition and cooperation through new combinations of concepts,
capabilities, people and organizations that exploit our nation's advantages and protect against our
asymmetric vulnerabilities to sustain our strategic position, which helps underpin peace and stability in
the world.”
5) The National Defense Strategy describes that as desirable strategic targets are not always attainable while
attainable strategic targets are sometimes not worth the costs, there can be trade-off between strategic
targets and scarce defense resources. Therefore, as stated in the 2001 QDR, it notes that the following
four risks that are difficult to be eliminated at a time should be controlled carefully:
(1) Operational Risks: Risks associated with the current force executing the strategy successfully within
acceptable costs
(2) Future Challenge Risks: Risks associated with the capacity to execute future missions successfully
against an array of prospective future challenges
(3) Force Management Risks: Risks associated with managing military forces in the areas of recruiting,
retaining, training, and readiness
(4) Institutional Risks: Risks associated with the capacity of new command, management, and business
practices
6) Robert M. Gates, in securing an approval from the Congress, told in writing that he would examine the
necessity of reviewing the posture of the U.S. forces after he was inaugurated as the new Secretary of
Defense.
7) The Striker Brigade Combat Team is formed as a light unit so that it can be deployed everywhere in the
world promptly by C-130 transport aircraft and other transportation means. Unlike heavily armed
conventional mechanized divisions, the team is equipped with “Striker,” 8-wheel-drive armored vehicles
that are loaded with 105 mm guns and other weapons and are characterized by strike assets and mobility.
8) Russia is opposed to the deployment of the MD system, insisting that it will give negative impact on the
country’s nuclear deterrent capability. The United States, however, explains that the target of the MD
system is not Russia: it will be deployed to protect Europe and other allies from missile threats posed by
Iran.
9) In September 2004, Admiral Fargo, then Commander of the U.S. Pacific Command stated that U.S. forces
were considering additional stationing of a Carrier Battle Group in the Pacific region.
10) According to the congressional testimony in September 2004 of Admiral Fargo, the Commander of the
U.S. Pacific Command, U. S. forces deployed bombers in Guam by rotation.

11) White House Fact Sheet (August 16, 2004)
12) Egypt, however, would remain under the direct responsibility of U.S. Central Command.
13) As for non-strategic nuclear forces, the Nuclear Posture Review announced by the Clinton Administration
in September 1994 states as follows: 1) Eliminate the option to deploy nuclear weapons on carrier-based,
dual-capable aircraft; 2) Eliminate the option to carry nuclear Tomahawk cruise missiles (TLAM/N) on
surface ships; 3) Retain the option to deploy TLAM/N on attack submarines; and 4) Retain the current
commitment of dual-capable aircraft based in Europe and Continental United States (CONUS) and the
deployment of nuclear weapons in Europe.
14) In the organizational reform of the U.S. Army, its conventional pyramid structure (army, corps, divisions,
and brigades) will be reorganized into the headquarters with command and control functions and selfsufficient combat units (in the size of brigade) so that it can respond to various situations promptly and
flexibly by combining headquarters and working units according to the purpose and scale of the mission.
15) Its headquarters is located at Camp Lejuene in North Carolina. As the Marine Corps Special Operation
Command was created, the 4th Marine Expeditionary Brigade was deactivated.
16) The United States aims to increase Army permanent end strength by 65,000 personnel and Marine Corps
permanent end strength by 27,000 personnel over the next five years. In detail, the temporary 30,000person increase and 5,000-person increase in the Army and the Marine Corps, respectively will be made
permanent. Army permanent end strength will grow by 7,000 personnel annually to reach 547,000 and
Marine Corps permanent end strength by 5,000 annually to reach 202,000.
17) C-17 is a large cargo aircraft with excellent takeoff-and-landing capabilities that can transport about 70
tons of goods to a front-line base located more than 4,000 km away. C-5 with a cargo load of about 120
tons can fly approximately 4,000 km, offload, and fly to a second base another 900 km away from the
original destination.
18) Joint editorial of the Korean Workers’ Party’s journals “Rodong Shinmun” and “Workers” (June 16,
1999)
19) The approximate percentage of active servicepersons in total population is 0.2% in Japan, 0.5% in the
United States, and 0.7% in Russia.
20) Generally, missiles based on a solid fuel propellant system are considered to be militarily superior to
those based on a liquid propellant system because they are capable of immediate launch as fuel is stored
in an airframe beforehand and they are easy to store and handle.
21) For example, in his statement to the Senate Armed Services Committee in February 2007, Lieutenant
General Michael D. Maples, Director, Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) stated as follows: “North
Korea remains committed to selling missiles and related technologies. Although sales have declined to
most customers due to its increasing international isolation, North Korea’s relationship with Iran and
Syria remain strong and of principal concern.”
22) On October 27, 2006, as a result of the independently collected information and its analysis as well as our
own careful examination of the U.S. and the ROK analyses, the Japanese government has judged that the
probability that North Korea had conducted a nuclear test was extremely high.
23) A nuclear reactor that uses graphite as a moderator
24) In this framework, measures that the United States and North Korea should take are shown, including
North Korea remaining as a member of NPT.
25) Nuclear fuel rods used in the operation of nuclear reactors contain plutonium. This plutonium can be
extracted by reprocessing the fuel rods.
26) The second and third rounds of Six-Party Talks were held in February and June 2004 respectively, the
fourth round held from July to August and in September 2005, and the fifth round in November 2005,
December 2006, and February 2007. The sixth round was held in March 2007 but then suspended.


-----

27) In his statement to the Senate Armed Services Committee in February 2007, Lieutenant General Michael
D. Maples, Director, Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) stated as follows: “North Korea’s resources
include a biotechnical infrastructure that could support the production of various biological warfare
agents. DIA believes North Korea has had a longstanding chemical weapons stockpile of nerve, blister,
blood, and choking agents.” Also, the Defense White Paper of the ROK published in December 2006
pointed out as follows: “It is believed that approximately 2,500 to 5,000 tons of a variety of agents,
including nerve agents, remain stored in a number of facilities scattered around the country and that North
Korea is able to produce biological weapons such as the bacteria of anthrax, small pox and cholera.”
28) The ranges of Scud-B and -C missiles are estimated to be about 300 km and 500 km, respectively.
29) North Korea admits that it is exporting ballistic missiles to earn foreign currency. (Comment by the
Korean Central New Agency (KCNA) on June 16, 1998, and statement made by a North Korea’s foreign
ministry spokesman on December 13, 2002 and reported by the KCNA on the same day )
30) In his statement to the House Armed Services Committee in March 2007, General Burwell B. Bell,
Commander, U.S. Forces Korea, stated as follows: “North Korea is developing a new solid propellant
short-range ballistic missile, which it last successfully test-fired in March 2006. Once operational, this
missile will be more mobile, more rapidly deployable, and more capable of being launched on shorter
notice than current systems. North Korea is also developing an intermediate range ballistic missile,
capable of targeting U.S. forces as far away as Guam and possibly Alaska.”
31) For example, a two-stage missile may be converted into a three-stage missile by installing a propulsion
device at the warhead.
32) In his statement to the House Armed Services Committee in March 2007, General Burwell B. Bell,
Commander, U.S. Forces Korea, stated as follows regarding the launch of ballistic missiles by North
Korea in July 2006: “These launches marked the highest number of missiles ever fired by North Korea in
a 24-hour period. … Some were fired in the hours of darkness? a first for the North Koreans. These
launches validated the operational status of North Korea’s inventory of about 800 theater ballistic missiles
targeting the Republic of Korea and Japan.” Also, the Commander pointed as follows at the Security
Forum held at the National Assembly of the ROK: “North Korea was able to launch a salvo of six Scud
and Nodong missiles of varying types and capabilities, by far the largest number of Theater Ballistic
Missiles ever launched by the north in a single day. By all accounts, all six of these missiles worked, …
And they appeared to be accurate.”
33) In December 2002, a North Korean vessel carrying Scud missiles to Yemen was intercepted and
inspected. It was pointed out that North Korea test-launched missiles in Iran and Pakistan after it exported
the missiles and subsequently utilized the data from said tests.
34) Four Military Guidelines were adopted at the fifth Plenum of the fourth Korean Workers’ Party’s Central
Committee in 1962.
35) In North Korea, it seems that various military decisions are made by the National Defense Commission
(Chairman Kim Jong Il), which has the ultimate military authority, and the Ministry of People’s Armed
Forces (corresponding to the Ministry of Defense in other countries) is controlled not by the cabinet but
by the National Defense Commission.
36) Reportedly, North Korea has two types of special operation forces: one under the military forces and the
other under the Korean Workers’ Party. For example, the operations department of the Party is said to be
in charge of transporting agents.
37) Covert operations by dispersed small units to infiltrate an enemy’s territory
38) The Supreme People’s Assembly is a decision-making organization composed of representatives selected
in an election. The Constitution of North Korea refers to the Supreme People’s Assembly as the “highest
organ of state power.” The assembly corresponds to Japan’s Diet.


-----

39) For example, in April 2007, a large-scale military parade including the march of a missile unit was held to
celebrate the 75th anniversary of the Korean People’s Army with attendance of Kim Jong Il, Chairman of
the National Defense Commission.
40) In April 2007, the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimated that North Korea’s
production of crop would be 4.07 million tons, approximately 0.1 million tons smaller than that of the
previous year and that North Korea would need to import as much as 0.96 million tons.
41) Due to the implementation of these new measures, it is pointed out that the following problems are
occurring or signs of such problems are observed in some areas: inflation accelerates due to the
simultaneous raising of wages and commodity prices despite the unsolved shortage of commodities, the
income gap widens, and dissatisfaction with the government increases as the people learn about the actual
situation.
42) According to the Country Reports on Terrorism 2006 published in April 2007. The report states that the
United States agreed to begin the process of removing the designation of North Korea as a state-sponsor
of terrorism.
43) The previous treaty contained the provision that if either of the signatories (Russia and North Korea) was
attacked, the other would immediately provide military and other assistance by any means. This
provision, however, was excluded from the new treaty.
44) The United States and the ROK have been operating the U.S.-ROK Combined Forces Command since
1978 in order to run the U.S.-ROK joint defense system to deter wars in the Korean Peninsular and to
perform effective joint operations in case of emergency. Under the U.S.-ROK joint defense system, the
operational control authority over ROK forces is to be exercised by the Chairman of the Korean Joint
Chiefs of Staff in peacetime and by the Commander of U.S. Forces Korea, who also serves as
Commander of the Combined Forces Command, in wartime.
45) The ROK dispatched a vessel to a joint search and rescue exercise conducted by the Russian Pacific Fleet
in August 2003, which was a part of multilateral joint military exercise. The exercise performed in
February 2004, therefore, was the first search and rescue exercise conducted jointly by the vessels of the
ROK and Russia.
46) The Defense White Paper 2006 described North Korea as follows: “North Korea’s conventional military
capabilities, nuclear tests, weapons of mass destruction, and forward military deployment pose serious
threats to our national security.”
47) In January 2001, the ROK and the United States reached an agreement, and as a result, the upper limit of
the range of the ROK’s missiles was extended from 180 km, which had been fixed based on a former
agreement between the two countries, to 300 km based on the Missile Technology Control Regime
(MTCR). The government of the ROK then announced new guidelines for its own missile development,
production, and possession, and joined the MTCR in March 2001.
48) Although the “Foal Eagle” exercise used to take place every fall, it has been conducted in conjunction
with “RSOI” since 2002.
49) Building of a harmonious society is said to be a process to solve social contradiction on a continuous
basis. In October 2006, at the Sixth Plenary Session of the 16th Communist Party of China (CPC) Central
Committee, the Resolution on Some Major Issues regarding the Building of a Harmonious Socialist
Society was adopted.
50) The 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR)(published in February 2006)
51) The term “responsible stakeholder,” since it was first used by then Deputy Secretary of State Robert B.
Zoellick in his speech made in New York in September 2005, has been frequently quoted in a variety of
documents published by the U.S. government. For example, in the U.S. Department of State’s Fact Sheet


-----

dated April 18, 2006, it is stated that “Deputy Secretary of State Zoellick has called on China to be a
responsible stakeholder in the international community, working with the United States and other major
nations to support the international system that has been such an instrumental part of China’s success.
52) Testimony of Deputy Undersecretary of Defense Richard Lawless at the U.S.-China Economic and
Security Review Commission held in February 2007
53) The Treaty states that both countries shall advance military confidence-building measures and reduction
of forces in border areas; promote technical cooperation in military fields; and hold contacts and
consultations when either of them recognizes a threat to peace.
54) China, Russia, and four central Asian countries (Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan)
established the SCO in June 2001. The organization aims at encouraging mutual cooperation in not only
security but also politics, culture, energy, and other broad areas. Since the establishment of this
organization, summit-level meetings have been held on a regular basis and the organization’s structure
and functions have been enhanced by such measures as establishing a secretariat and the Regional
Antiterrorist Structure (RATS).
55) Recent military exchanges between China and Southeast Asian countries include joint search and rescue
exercise conducted for the first time by the Chinese and Thai Navies in December 2005, joint patrol
conducted for the first time by the vessels of the Chinese and Vietnamese Navies in the Gulf of Tonkin in
April 2006, and Defense Minister Cao Gangchuan’s visits to Vietnam, Malaysia, and Singapore in April
2006.
56) The leaders participating in the fifth SCO summit meeting held in July 2005 issued a statement that a
deadline should be clearly set for the withdrawal of foreign forces stationed in Uzbekistan and Kyrgyz.
57) China traditionally adopted the strategy of “People’s War” based on the recognition that there was a
possibility of world-scale war in the future. Under that strategy, the country attributed importance to
guerrilla warfare using its vast territory and enormous population. This posture, however, led to harmful
effects such as excessively enlarged and inefficient military forces. Under these circumstances, based on a
new recognition that a world-scale war will not take place on a long-term basis, China has come to place
importance on local wars over its territories and territorial waters since the first half of the 1980s. After
the end of the Gulf War in 1991, it started to implement measures to improve its ability of military
operations, in order to win local wars under hi-tech conditions. In recent years, it upholds as its strategic
objective to establish informationalized armed forces and win informationalized wars.
58) For example, in China’s National Defense in 2006 published in December 2006, “opposing and
containing the separatist forces for ‘Taiwan Dependence’ and their activities” is included in the country’s
national defense policy.
59) Annual Threat Assessment of the Director of National Intelligence published in the United States in
January 2007 states as follows: “Beijing continues its rapid rate of military modernization, initiated in
1999. We assess that China’s aspirations for great power statue, threat perceptions, and security strategy
would drive this modernization effort even if the Taiwan problem were resolved.”
60) China pursues modernization of its armed forces “in accordance with the state’s overall plan to realize
modernization” and aims to modernize the country and its armed forces step by step by around 2020,
which falls on the centenary of the Communist Party of China and by around 2050, which falls on the
centenary of People’s Republic of China. China, for the modernization of the country, plans to “bring
China into a well-off society of a higher level to the benefit of well over one billion people” and for the
modernization of the armed forces, plans to “(lay a foundation by 2010 and) make major progress around
2020.” Also, China states that it will “bring the per capita GDP up to the level of moderately developed
countries and realize modernization in the main” by around 2050 and “to basically reach the strategic goal

of building informationized armed forces and being capable of winning informationized wars.”
(Constitution of the Communist Party of China revised in 2002 and China’s National Defense in 2006)
61) Simple conversion of national defense expenditures of countries into foreign currencies based on the
market exchange rates does not always reflect the value in light of the country’s level of prices. If,
however, China’s FY 2007 national defense budget is converted at one yuan = 15 yen into yen, the
amount is equivalent to approximately 5208.5 billion yen, exceeding Japan’s national defense-related
expenditures for FY 2007 (approximately 4781.8 billion yen).
62) The U.S. Defense Department’s Annual Report on Chinese Military Power (May 2007) estimates that
China’s actual military-related spending for 2007 could be $85 billion to $125 billion, although its official
defense budget for 2007 is approximately $45 billion. The report points out as follows: “China’s
published defense budget does not include large categories of expenditure, including expense for strategic
forces, foreign acquisitions, military-related research and development, and China’s paramilitary forces.”
63) The People’s Armed Police Force is responsible for protecting facilities of the Party and the state, border
patrol, maintaining security, implementing joint government-citizen projects, and conducting firefighting
activities. According to China’s National Defense in 2002, these troops are to maintain state security and
social stability, and assist the PLA in wartime in defensive operations.
64) Responsible for economic construction in peacetime, and for combat support in time of war. China’s
National Defense in 2002 states as follows: “Under the command of military organs, the militia in
wartime helps the standing army in its military operations, conducts independent operations and provides
combat support and manpower replenishment for the standing army. In peacetime, it undertakes the tasks
of performing combat readiness support, taking part in emergency rescue and disaster relief efforts, and
maintaining social order.”
65) Annual Threat Assessment of the Director of National Intelligence published in the United States in
January 2006 states as follows: “The Chinese are developing more capable long-range conventional strike
systems and short- and medium-range ballistic missiles with terminally guided maneuverable warheads
able to attack US carriers and airbases.
66) Since the 1980s, China has been purchasing aircraft carriers nominally for recycling scraps of iron and for
using them at leisure facilities, specifically decommissioned Majestic-class aircraft carrier Melbourne
made in the United Kingdom and Kiev-class aircraft carriers Minsk and Kiev made in the former Soviet
Union. Subsequently in 2000, China purchased an uncompleted Kuznetsov-class aircraft carrier Varyag
from Ukraine and reportedly has been repairing it, including repainting. Also in 2006, it was reported that
China was negotiating about the purchase of Russian-made Su-33 ship-based aircraft, which can be
operated on board a Kuznetsov-class carrier.
67) The Annual Report to Congress: Military Power of the People’s Republic of China, which was published
by the U.S. Department of Defense in May 2006, points out that the goal of the Chinese Air Force is “to
develop a mobile, all-weather, day-night, low-altitude, over-water force that is capable and flexible
enough to quickly perform multiple operational tasks and to project power beyond “first island chain.”
68) On September 9, 2005, a P-3C surveillance aircraft of the MSDF confirmed that five vessels in total,
including one Sovremenny-class destroyer operated near the Kashi (Tianwaitian in Chinese) gas field in
the East China Sea, and some of these vessels (a total of three including a Sovremenny-class destroyer)
circled around the drilling facilities of the said gas field.
69) A US official presented the view that China has assumed a more confident and increasingly assertive
posture” than before, and the anti-satellite weapon test in January 2007 and the Chinese Song-class
submarine incident in October 2006 can be viewed in this context. (According to the testimony of Deputy


-----

Undersecretary of Defense Richard Lawless at the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review
Commission held on February 1, 2007)
70) According to the national defense report published by the Ministry of National Defense of Taiwan in
2006
71) The economic growth rate was 6.7% in 2006.
72) The National Security Concept of the Russian Federation, formulated in 1997, was revised in January
2000. This revision was made in response to changed circumstances, including NATO enlargement, air
strikes on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, NATO’s announcement of its New Strategic Concept, and
the emergence of Islamic extremist groups in and around Russia.
73) A change can be seen in the Russian stance on NATO enlargement since the National Security Concept
was first developed. In recent years, President Putin and other high government officials have emphasized
the importance of promoting a cooperative relationship with NATO, while repeatedly expressing
concerns over NATO enlargement. In April 2005, Russia and NATO signed a status of forces agreement
allowing the transit of troops through each other’s territory.
74) The following issues are pointed out as additional threats to Russia: attempts to weaken Russia’s position
as a core nation in a multipolar world, moves to weaken the integration process of the CIS, and demands
for Russian territory.
75) The following operations are listed as other peacetime operations: preventing or intercepting subversive
acts, maintaining and using the readiness of nuclear deterrent capabilities, conducting peacemaking
operations under the mandate of the United Nations or CIS, and preventing emergencies and recovering
the damage.
76) Troops with high degree of combat readiness. Troops were reorganized in the reduction of military
strength after the launch of the armed forces of the Russian Federation, and military personnel were
concentrated in the troops so that they can immediately take action as combat-ready troops in the first
phase of a large-scale war or in the event of a small conflict.
77) In November 2005, then Defense Minster Ivanov said that Russia would decrease the number of military
personnel from 1,134,800 to 1,100,000 by 2011. Subsequently in May 2006, President Putin said that
Russia would aim to reduce the number to an appropriate level of one million through spontaneous
retirement of military personnel.
78) In accordance with the 1997 presidential decree, the Missile-Space Defense Unit of the Air Defense Force
responsible for operating anti-ballistic missiles (ABM) and the Space Force responsible for the launch
and control of space flight objects were integrated into the Strategic Missile Force, a military service in
charge of ICBMs. However, a presidential decree in 2002 established a new Space Force and a new
Strategic Force to launch ICBMs as branches of the military by integrating the former Military Space
Force and the former Missile-Space Defense Unit in the Strategic Missile Force by the end of May 2002.
As a result, the Russian armed forces have three services: ground, naval, and air; as well as three
independent strategic branches: missile, space, and airborne branches.
79) In April 2007, President Putin said that professional servicemen would account for two-thirds of the
armed force in his annual presidential message.
80) The national defense budget for FY 2007 increased by approximately 23% over the previous fiscal year
on a nominal basis.
81) Military cooperation between the two countries, which started with confidence building, has been
developing into a state that envisages actual joint actions. For example, command post exercises
codenamed “Torgau 2004” were started between the U.S. ground forces stationed in Europe and Russian
ground forces in 2004, and “Torgau 2005,” which included field training, was also launched in 2005.


-----

82) The United States, in its Quadrennial Defense Review published in February 2006, states “The United
States remains concerned about the erosion of democracy in Russia, the curtailment of non-governmental
organizations (NGOs) and freedom of the press, the centralization of political powers and limits on
economic freedom.” President Putin, on the other hand, criticized the U.S. diplomatic attitude for
imposing its policies on other nations at the Munich Security Conference held by a private organization in
February 2007.
83) Some CIS countries want to maintain their distance from Russia. Georgia, Ukraine, Azerbaijan, and
Moldova formed a regional alliance named GUAM by combining the initial letters of the member
countries, and have been following pro-Western policies to reduce their security and economic
dependence on Russia.(Uzbekistan jointed the GUAM in 1999 after withdrawing from the CIS Collective
Security Treaty, but withdrew from the alliance in 2005.)
84) In August 2001, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz, and Tajikistan provided one troop (battalion or smaller
unit) each to form the Collective Rapid Deployment Force that was 1,000 to 1,300 strong. The command
is located in Bishkek, the capital of Kyrgyz. In May 2004, Tajikistan provided another two troops and
Russia and Kazakhstan provided one more each. As a result, there are now nine battalions with 4,500
personnel.
85) The United States and others have been using the Manas base for antiterrorism operations, which is
located in the vicinity of Kant Air Base.
86) The following nine items have been named as common interests: (1) the fight against terrorism, (2) crisis
management, (3) the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their conveyance, (4)
measures to increase arms control and confidence, (5) theater missile defense, (6) search and rescue at
sea, (7) military cooperation and defense reform, (8) responses to civilian emergency situations, and (9)
new threats and challenges.
87) President Putin has expressed Russia’s intention to join the East Asia Summit as an official member.
88) Russian Foreign Policy Concept (published in July 2000)
89) From 2003 to 2004, Russia concluded contracts with Indonesia, Malaysia, and Vietnam to sell its Su27and Su-30 jet fighters. In addition, Russia signed a contract in January 2004 to sell its aircraft carrier to
India. In 2006, the country concluded agreements to sell its Su-30 jet fighters with Algeria and
Venezuela, and some were already sold to the countries. It seems that Russia is promoting export to
countries other than its traditional trade partners.
90) At the Kananaskis Summit held in June 2002, the G8 countries decided to provide up to $20 billion over
next ten years to assist Russia in disposing of chemical weapons, dismantling decommissioned
submarines, and fissionable materials.
91) Some divisions and brigades are designated as permanent combat-ready troops. Others are through to be
extremely deficient in the number of staff, although they have sufficient equipment.
92) In 2000, the nuclear submarine Kursk of the Northern Fleet sank in the Barents Sea in an accident. In
2005, a small submersible vessel became incapable of surfacing off the coast of Kamchatka Peninsula.
Also, aircraft and helicopter accidents often took place.
93) Estimated number of military personnel within the Siberian and Far Eastern Military Districts
94) For the recent examples of increasing air force capabilities, Vietnam introduced Su-30 fighters and
Indonesia introduced Su-27 and Su-30 fighters in 2004. Singapore signed a contract with the United
States in 2005 to purchase F-15 fighters. Furthermore, Malaysia plans to introduce Su-30 fighters within
2007. To develop naval force capabilities for example, Malaysia, which had not possessed any
submarines, signed a contract to purchase Scorpene-class submarines with France in 2002 and Singapore
signed a contract to purchase Vastergotland-class submarines with Sweden in 2005.


-----

95) The ReCAAP is designed to enhance cooperation among maritime security agencies of the countries
involved through the establishment of a piracy-related information sharing system and a cooperation
network among the countries. Among 16 countries that participated in the negotiations, there are 14
signatories (Japan, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Brunei, Vietnam, Laos, Myanmar, Cambodia,
China, Republic of Korea, India, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh) except Indonesia and Malaysia (as of
November 2006).
96) Thailand, the United States, Japan, Singapore, Indonesia and 9 additional countries participated in this
exercise conducted in May 2007.
97) Major Non-NATO Ally (MNNA), which was a status based on the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 and
the Nunn Amendment of 1987, allows designated countries to receive benefits in military areas such as
eligibility to have U.S.-owned military equipment. A status of MNNA also represents significant
implications that the United States places importance on its close military cooperation with MNNA
countries.
98) IMET, started in 1976, provides military personnel of U.S. allies and friends with opportunities to study
and receive training at U.S. military education facilities. The United States has suspended IMET to
Indonesia since 1999 as sanction measures against the suppression by the Indonesian authorities of the
East Timor independence movement.
99) As of March 2007, the strength of UNMIT is 1588 personnel in total, including 33 military observers and
1555 police. In addition, 1161 personnel such as civilians are deployed.
100) The draft of the Regional Code of Conduct in the South China Sea was proposed at an ASEAN-China
officials meeting discussion in 1999 and consultations have been continued at working level meetings
since then. The draft, however, has yet to be adopted because there is a great difference in the countries’
opinions on the details.
101) The Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea clarifies general principles for
resolving issues related to the South China Sea. However, this declaration contains political targets only
and is not legally binding. Therefore, it is mentioned in the declaration that the parties concerned will
continue the efforts to develop the Regional Code of Conduct in the South China Sea, which will provide
detailed activities and be legally binding.
102) The country has Islamic population exceeding 100 million, which is estimated to be the world’s second
largest next to Indonesia.
103) President Bush called India a natural partner of the United States.
104) In cooperation with India, the United States intends to provide India with capabilities and technologies
required for the country to improve its defense capabilities to the appropriate level, including the sale of
F-16 and F-18 fighters.
105) The U.S. and Indian air forces conducted joint exercises in November 2005 and the U.S. and Indian
ground forces carried out joint exercises in January 2006. Also, the Indian air forces participated in a
multilateral joint exercise organized by the U.S. air force in July 2004. Furthermore, the joint naval
exercise Malabar 07-1 was carried out off the coast of Okinawa in the East China Sea in April 2007.
106) For the solution of the pending border issue, the countries agreed to each appoint a special representative.
Also, in the declaration, India recognizes that the Tibet Autonomous Region is part of the territory of the
People’s Republic of China.
107) In the agreement, China admits that Sikkim belongs to India. Also, the two countries agreed to continue
efforts for the early settlement of the pending border issue.
108) Both countries agreed to hold regular summit meetings and established the target of doubling the bilateral
trade amount to $40 billion by 2010. They also signed an agreement on such issues as investment
protection and mutual establishment of new Consulates General.


-----

109) In November 2004, India conducted a test launch of the missile on board.
110) The Indian Prime Minister’s special envoy, Shyam Saran referred to President Putin’s expression of
intention to cooperation in civilian nuclear activities that implementation would be after the revision of
the rules of the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG).
111) It is estimated that weapons from the former Soviet Union or Russia account for about 70 percent of those
possessed by India.
112) The two countries signed the document concerning the joint development project of mid-size
multipurpose transport aircraft and the fifth generation fighter. Also, study was made on the proposal to
provide India with additional T-90 tanks, Su-30MKI fighters, and Mil-17 helicopters within the
framework of the agreement already concluded. It was confirmed to enhance the production capabilities
of the Brahmos cruise missiles now under development jointly by the two countries as well as to aim to
develop the air launch version of the missile. An intergovernmental agreement was concluded concerning
the contract for licensed production of engines for MiG-29 fighters. It was also agreed that the two
countries conduct joint antiterrorism military exercises in Russian territory in April and September 2007.
113) The joint exercise Indra has been conducted every other year since 2003.
114) At the same time, India signed the Framework Agreement on Comprehensive Economic Cooperation
between India and ASEAN and the ASEAN-India Joint Declaration for Cooperation to Combat
International Terrorism.
115) In November 2006, Chinese President Hu Jintao visited Pakistan to meet with President Musharraf and
both agreed to strengthen the military and strategic cooperation and expand the economic cooperation
including the Free Trade Agreement (FTA). President Hu Jintao expressed the intention to continue
cooperation in civilian nuclear activities. The two countries also agreed on the joint development of air
force aircraft including the Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS).
116) Pakistan has supported the fight against terrorism led by the United States and other countries. For
example, it provided logistical support for the U.S. operations against Afghanistan, and carried out
operations to mop out terrorists in the border areas of Afghanistan. Also, it started to dispatch warships to
naval operations in the Indian Ocean in April 2004. Appreciating these supports from Pakistan, the United
States designated the country as a major non-NATO ally.
117) At the same time, the sanctions that had been imposed also on India by the United States and other
countries due to India’s nuclear test were lifted.
118) Regarding the possibility of extending cooperation to Pakistan in the nuclear energy issue, President Bush
only referred to the differences between Pakistan and India in terms of energy needs and history. In
response, Pakistan stated that it was important for the United States to treat India and Pakistan equally in
order to ensure strategic stability in South Asia.
119) In September 2005, President Musharraf reportedly demonstrated his recognition that the Kahn network
had probably exported a dozen of ultracentrifuges to North Korea.
120) In March 2006, some including a U.S. diplomat were killed in a suicide car bombing targeting the U.S.
Consulate General in Karachi.
121) The two countries have adopted greatly different positions in relation to solving the Kashmir territorial
issue. India’s territorial claim over Kashmir is based on the document from the Maharaja of Kashmir to
India, while Pakistan claims that the territorial claim over Kashmir should be decided through the
referendum in accordance with the 1948 U.N. resolution.
122) Also, in August 2005, the two countries agreed on the prior notification of ballistic missile testing and on
the establishment of a hotline between their Vice Foreign Ministers.


-----

123) India and Pakistan have said that they will make efforts to reach a national consensus to sign the CTBT.
124) Following the nuclear test, India expressed concern about the nuclear environment in India’s
neighborhood. On the other hand, Pakistan gave the reason of the nuclear test as India’s nuclear threat.
125) Pakistan conducted the test-launch of the Babur (Hataf VII) cruise missile also in March 2007.
126) Pakistani Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz, who observed the launch of the Ghauri missile, stated that
Pakistan can be justifiably proud of its defence capability and the reliability of its nuclear deterrence.
127) Trilateral security treaty between Australia, New Zealand, and the United States, which went into effect
in 1952. However, the United States has suspended its obligation to defend New Zealand since 1986
because of New Zealand’s non-nuclear policy.
128) This consultation has been held every year since the United States suspended its obligation to defend New
Zealand in 1986.
129) The participation in the Joint Strike Fighter Program was decided in June 2002. The expansion and
improvement the U.S.-Australia joint training facilities were agreed upon in Australia-United States
Ministerial Consultations in July 2004.
130) Joint exercises between the two countries had been suspended from September 1999 until April 2005 due
to differences in their response to the East Timor issue.
131) Referred to as non-Article 5 operations.
132) In the NATO Summit, the enhancement of the ISAF was an issue of discussion and it was pointed out
that there were split opinions on matters such as the increase of military force and the restriction of the
areas of deployment imposed on by the respective countries. Also, a policy was launched to strengthen
cooperation with non-NATO countries on a case by case basis.
133) The NATO Ministerial Meeting in Berlin in June 1996 made a decision enabling access to NATO’s assets
and capabilities in operations led by the Western European Union (WEU). Most of the WEU’s roles and
duties were thereafter handed over to the EU. Accordingly, the NATO Washington Summit Meeting in
April 1999 again decided to give the EU access to NATO’s assets and capabilities. The decision is called
Berlin Plus. In December 2002, a permanent arrangement on the said decision was made between NATO
and the EU.
134) These are termed Petersburg operations, and comprise combat unit missions in crisis management,
including (1) humanitarian support and rescue/relief, (2) peacekeeping, and (3) peace building.
135) The tactical and strategic forces of Allied Command Europe and Allied Command Atlantic were
consolidated into a single force (Allied Command Operations), and Allied Command Transformation was
created to oversee reform of NATO’s military capabilities and improvement to interoperability.
136) NATO concluded a cooperation treaty with East European countries and other non-NATO countries of
the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) to build confidence and maintain
interoperability.
137) The United Kingdom defines the capability to perform operations as that to perform a total of three
operations at the same time: one large scale operation under the United States leadership as in the Gulf
War, and two small to medium operations under NATO leadership as in conflicts in Bosnia and Kosovo.
138) Since Vanguard class nuclear-powered submarines now in operation are expected to decommission
starting in the early 2020s, the British government studied on whether or not to maintain nuclear deterrent
and consequently published this white paper. In March 2007, the House of Commons adopted the motion
submitted by the government to support the policy of the white paper.
139) The intervention force comprises combat readiness troops equipped with state-of-art weapons. It is
designed to deal with opponents that have well organized military formations in intensive operations,
which are implemented multilaterally by NATO combat readiness troops or EU Battle group units, with


-----

the goal of providing foundation to peace stabilization operations. The stabilization force deals with
opponents that have a certain level of military formations and perform peace stabilization operations in
low- and medium-intensity operations that last for a relatively long period. The assistance force supports
the intervention and stabilization forces in preparing for and performing operations in Germany and in the
target areas, including the management of command, educational, and training organizations.
140) France is now operating one nuclear-powered submarine.
141) NATO and Warsaw Pact Organization (WPO) member countries as of 1990
142) Several problems must be resolved before it goes into effect, including the fact that the three new Baltic
members of NATO have not concluded the CFE Treaty.
143) Efforts are made to disclose military intelligence, restrict certain military operations, and promote military
communication in order to prevent accidental armed conflicts and build confidence between states. In
general, these are referred to as confidence building measures.
144) Later, the Vienna Document 1999 was adopted in 1999, adding the following to the former documents:
promotion of multilateral and bilateral measures for regional confidence building; provision of
information on military exchanges; and restriction on the implementation of exercises based on the
number of armored infantry combat vehicles and the scale of artillery units.
145) Aerial inspections are conducted by unarmed aircraft equipped with predfined types of sensors, in
accordance with flight plans proposed by the inspecting nation and accepted by the country being
inspected. Any signatory can access data collected through the inspections.
146) The number of U.N. personnel killed in operations such as PKOs was 104 in 2006, and the total thus far
has reached 2,355 (at the end of March 2007); it is desired that measures to ensure the safety of personnel
engaged in such activities as PKOs be taken promptly.

Section 1. Measures to Ensure Japan’s Security

Peace and security are indispensable for the prosperity of a nation and its people. A country also requires
independence in order to determine its own political, economic, and social directions, and to preserve its
culture, traditions, and values.
Peace, security, and independence do not happen of their own accord. As countries become increasingly
interdependent on one another, attaining peace, security and independence requires a comprehensive approach
that includes diplomatic measures, cooperation with allies, as well as the nation’s own defense system. As
Japan is heavily dependent on other countries for many resources and its development and prosperity depends
on free trade, sustained peace and cooperation with the international community is of vital importance.
Japan is pursuing both regional cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region and global cooperation through
organizations such as the United Nations (U.N.), while strengthening bilateral cooperation with other countries
through such measures as the Japan-U.S. Alliance[1]. Japan is thus working to prevent and resolve disputes and
hostilities, encourage economic development, promote arms control and disarmament, and increase mutual
understanding and trust.
Japan has also been making the country itself more secure, by making society more stable, fostering a
willingness to defend the country, and through various economic and educational measures. The objective is to
avoid being unguarded that could lead to foreign aggression.
In today’s world, however, such measures may not deter real aggression by an outside force, and in the
worst case, might not be sufficient to repel an attack on Japan. It is indeed difficult to guarantee national
security purely by non-military means.
Defense capability is in itself an expression of a nation’s will and ability to repel aggression. It provides the
ultimate guarantee of a country’s security, and cannot easily be replaced by other means. Therefore, the
Government has been building its defense capabilities
and upholds the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements,
thereby improving the credibility of such arrangements
and bolstering its defense measures. In addition to
protecting Japan, defense capabilities have become
increasingly important for peacekeeping activities,
reconstruction assistance, and other efforts to improve
international security.
Recognizing the important role played by its
defense capabilities, Japan will continue to do its
utmost to protect the nation’s security, while working
to achieve security in the Asia-Pacific region and Prime Minister Abe delivers a speech at the 2006 commencement ceremony of

**[COLUMN]**


**COMMENTARY**

**National Security Council (NSC)**

In his General Policy Speech to the 165th extraordinary session of the Diet on September 29 last year,
Prime Minister Abe declared his intention to develop a system for strengthening the headquarters function
of the Prime Minister’s Office with regard to diplomacy and security.


-----

Under this policy, the government organized the Council on the Strengthening of the Function of the
Prime Minister’s Office Regarding National Security in November last year, whose members include the
Prime Minister (Chairman), Chief Cabinet Secretary, Special Advisor to the Prime Minister on National
Security Issues, and experts from outside the government, and began to discuss specific measures.
The council compiled and submitted a report in February this year, and based on this report, the Bill to
Amend the Security Council Establishment Law was drawn up mainly to review the current Security
Council of Japan radically and establish the National Security Council (Japanese version of the U.S.
National Security Council). The bill was adopted at the Cabinet meeting held on April 4, and submitted to
the Diet.

The major proposals of the bill are as follows:
1 Change of the name of the council

❍ The name of the council will be changed from the “Security Council of Japan” to the “National
Security Council.”
2 Review of the scope of deliberation

❍ The scope of deliberation will be expanded to include basic diplomatic and defense policies for
enhancing Japan’s national security.

❍ However, the matters for which consultation with the current Security Council of Japan is obligatory
will be maintained without any change.
3 Review of the deliberation method

❍ A new framework in which the four ministers—Prime Minister, Minister of Foreign Affairs,
Minister of Defense, and Chief Cabinet Secretary—will discuss matters related to national security
will be developed.

❍ Any matter for which consultation with the current Security Council of Japan is obligatory will be
discussed, as in the Security Council of Japan, by the nine member ministers.

❍ The Chairman (Prime Minister) can decide at his/her sole discretion to allow other Cabinet members
than the four/nine ministers of the council to participate in a deliberation.
4 Establishment of the expert meeting system

❍ A new system in which a related Cabinet member will investigate and deliberate a particular
national security matter will be established.
5 Special Advisor to the Prime Minister

❍ New provisions regarding the participation of the Special Advisor to the Prime Minister in
deliberations will be added.
6 Secretariat

❍ A secretariat responsible for administrative work of the National Security Council will be
established, and Secretary General and other personnel will be positioned.

The National Security Council is expected to provide a system to consolidate the government’s
security efforts even more efficiently.

Section 2. The Constitution and the Right of Self-Defense

**1. The Constitution and the Right of Self-Defense**
Since the end of World War II, Japan has worked hard to build a peace-loving nation far from the miseries of
war. The Japanese people desire lasting peace, and the principle of pacifism is enshrined in the Constitution, of
which Article 9 renounces war, the possession of war potential, and the right of belligerence by the state.
Nonetheless, for Japan to remain an independent nation, these provisions do not deny Japan’s inherent right of
self-defense as a sovereign state. (See Reference 8)
Since the right of self-defense is not denied, the Government interprets this to mean that the Constitution
allows Japan to possess the minimum level of armed force needed to exercise that right. Therefore, the
Government, as part of its exclusively national defense oriented policy under the Constitution, maintains the
Self-Defense Forces (SDF) as an armed organization, and continues to keep it equipped and ready for
operations.

**2. The Government’s View on Article 9 of the Constitution**

**1. The Permitted Self-Defense Capability**
Under the Constitution, Japan is permitted to possess the minimum necessary level of self-defense capability.
The specific limit may vary with the prevailing international situation, the technologies available, and
various other factors, and it is discussed and decided according to annual budgets and other factors by the Diet
on behalf of the people. Whether such capability constitutes a “war potential” that is prohibited by Article 9,
Paragraph 2 of the Constitution must be considered within the context of Japan’s overall military strength.
Therefore, whether the SDF should be allowed to possess certain armaments depends on whether such
possession would cause its total military strength to exceed the constitutional limit.
The possession of armaments deemed to be offensive weapons designed to be used only for the mass
destruction of another country would, by definition, exceed the minimum necessary level and so are not
permissible under any circumstances. For example, the SDF is not allowed to possess intercontinental ballistic
missiles (ICBMs), long-range strategic bombers, or attack aircraft carriers.

**2. Requirements for Exercising the Right of Self-Defense**
The Government has long interpreted Article 9 of the Constitution to mean that armed force can be used to
exercise the right of self-defense only when the following three conditions are met:
1) When there is an imminent and illegitimate act of aggression against Japan;
2) When there is no appropriate means to deal with such aggression other than by resorting to the right; and
3) When the use of armed force is confined to the minimum necessary level.

**3. Geographic Boundaries within which the Right of Self-Defense may be Exercised**
The use of minimum necessary force to defend Japan under the right of self-defense is not necessarily confined
to the geographic boundaries of Japanese territory, territorial waters and airspace. However, it is difficult to
give a general definition of the actual extent to which it may be used, as this would vary with the situation.
Nevertheless, the Government interprets that the Constitution does not permit armed troops to be
dispatched to the land, sea, or airspace of other countries with the aim of using force; such overseas
deployment of troops would exceed the definition of the minimum necessary level for self-defense.


-----

**4. The Right of Collective Self-Defense**
International law permits a state to have the right of collective self-defense, which is the right to use force to
stop an armed attack on a foreign country with which the state has close relations, even if the state itself is not
under direct attack. Since Japan is a sovereign state, it naturally has the right of collective self-defense under
international law. Nevertheless, the Japanese Government believes that the exercise of the right of collective
self-defense exceeds the limit of self-defense authorized under Article 9 of the Constitution and is not
permissible. (See Reference 9)

**5. The Right of Belligerence**
Article 9, Paragraph 2 of the Constitution prescribes that “the right of belligerence of the State shall not be
recognized.” However, the “right of belligerence” does not mean the right to engage in battle; rather, it is a
general term for various rights that a belligerent nation has under international law, including the authority to
inflict casualties and damage upon the enemy’s
military force and to occupy enemy territory.
On the other hand, Japan may of course use the
minimum level of force necessary to defend itself. For
example, if Japan inflicts casualties and damage upon
an enemy’s military force in exercising its right of
self-defense, this is conceptually distinguished from
the exercise of the right of belligerence, even though
the actual actions appear to be no different.
Occupation of enemy territory, however, would
exceed the minimum necessary level of self-defense

**COMMENTARY**

**Council on Reconstruction of a Legal Basis for Security**

Prime Minister Abe has been advocating the need to reconstruct a legal basis for security that befits the
current situations and proves feasible at a time of major changes faced by Japan’s security environment.
As part of efforts to meet this need, it was announced on April 25 this year that the Council on
Reconstruction of a Legal Basis for Security would be organized with the purpose of examining and
studying on the basis of typified, individual, specific cases how to organize the relationship between
Japan’s security policy and the Constitution, including the issue of the right of collective self-defense. The
first meeting of the council was held on May 18 this year.
The council will compile the results of the study in a report by around autumn this year, and submit it
to Prime Minister Abe.


-----

Section 3. The Basis of Defense Policy

**1. National Defense Policy**
Under the Constitution, Japan has adhered to its National Defense Policy, which was adopted by the National
Defense Council[2] and approved by the Cabinet in 1957. (See Reference 10)
The National Defense Policy defines policies to establish the foundation of security through international
harmonization and peace activities, as well as ensuring the stability of society, and then to establish efficient
defense capabilities and to maintain the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements.

**2. Other Basic Policies**
Under the National Defense Policy, Japan has been building a modest defense capability under the Constitution
purely for defense purposes without becoming a military power that could threaten other countries, while
adhering to the principle of civilian control of the military, observing the Three Non-Nuclear Principles, and
firmly maintaining the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements.

**1. Exclusively Defense Oriented Policy**
The exclusively defense oriented policy means that Japan will not employ defensive force unless and until an
armed attack is mounted on Japan by another country, and even in such a case, only the minimum force
necessary to defend itself may be used. Furthermore, only the minimum defense forces necessary for selfdefense should be retained and used. This exclusively defense-oriented policy is a passive defense strategy that
is consistent with the spirit of the Constitution.

**2. Not Becoming a Military Power**
There is no established definition for the term “military power.” For Japan, however, not becoming a military
power that could threaten the security of other countries means that Japan will not possess more military force
than is necessary for self-defense and that could pose a threat to other countries.

**3. The Three Non-Nuclear Principles**
The Three Non-Nuclear Principles are that Japan: will not possess nuclear weapons, will not produce nuclear
weapons, and will not allow nuclear weapons into Japan. Japan adheres to the Three Non-Nuclear Principles as
a fixed national policy.
Japan is prohibited from manufacturing or possessing nuclear weapons also under the Atomic Energy Basic
Law[3]. In addition, Japan ratified the NPT (Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons), and as a nonnuclear weapons state, is not permitted to produce or acquire nuclear weapons[4].

**4. Ensuring Civilian Control**
Civilian control of the military means the precedence of political will over the military in a democratic state,
and hence democratic political control over the military.
Learning lessons from World War II, Japan has adopted the following systems of uncompromising civilian
control that are entirely different from those under the former Constitution[5]. Civilian control ensures that the
SDF is operated in accordance with the will of the people.
The Japanese people are represented in the Diet, which makes legislative and budgetary decisions on
matters such as the authorized number of SDF Regular Personnel and principal institutions of the SDF. It also
approves defense operations.


-----

As part of its general administrative functions, the Cabinet has entire authority related to defense. The
Constitution requires the Prime Minister and other Ministers of State in the Cabinet to be civilians. The Prime
Minister, acting on behalf of the Cabinet, is the supreme commander of the SDF. The Minister of Defense, who
is exclusively in charge of national defense, exercises general control over SDF activities. The Security
Council of Japan [6] within the Cabinet discusses
important defense matters. (See Reference 64 • 67)
At the Ministry of Defense, the Minister of
Defense is in charge of administrative work related to
national defense and controls the SDF. The Minister of
Defense is assisted in planning political measures and
administration by the Senior Vice-Minister and two
Parliamentary Secretaries[7].
As mentioned above, the military is under civilian
control. The success of the system depends on ongoing
political and administrative efforts, as well as a keen
interest among Japanese citizens in defense issues. Parliamentary Secretary for Defense Kitagawa (on left) meets with Secretary of

State for National Defense and Sea Affairs of Portugal Gomes

**COMMENTARY**

**Strengthening Intelligent Capabilities of the Prime Minister’s Office**

The close collaboration between the policy-side and the intelligence-side is essential to strengthen the
Prime Minister’s Office capability regarding national security.
Based on this understanding, the Study Group on Intelligence Function Enhancement was established
last December with the Chief Cabinet Secretary as the head of the group, and “the Basic Concepts for
Strengthening Intelligence Capabilities of the Prime Minister’s Office” was announced on February 28
this year after discussions within the government.
The government is planning to determine specific measures based on the concepts within about the
next six months.

“The Basic Concepts for Strengthening Intelligence Capabilities of the Prime Minister’s Office” can
be summarized as follows:
❍ While the separation of policy and intelligence will be maintained, the Cabinet Intelligence Committee
meeting, the Director of Cabinet Intelligence, and each intelligence services will collaborate with each
other to organically connect policy and intelligence.

❍ Technical and organized means, methods and setup for external human intelligence will be studied and
realized as soon as possible.

❍ The current Joint Intelligence Committee meetings will be upgraded functionally to serve as the place
where the intelligence community combines their wisdom. The intelligence community will carry out
all source analysis at these meetings and other occasions to provide information needed by the policy-
making function, and promote information sharing.

❍ Information analysis experts (Cabinet Information Analyst (tentative name)) will be positioned at the
Cabinet Intelligence and Research Office to draft intelligence assessment reports.

❍ Information protection measures, including the establishment of a security clearance system and other
unified government standards, need to be taken.


-----

❍ There is also a need to discuss new legislation for the protection of classified information.

The Ministry of Defense, which plays an important role in the intelligence community, continues to
actively provide the Prime Minister’s office with information necessary for security in close collaboration
with other government agencies.

**Notes**
1) The Japan-U.S. Alliance means the relationship between Japan and the United States in which they, as
nations that share fundamental values and interests, work closely with each other on political, economic,
and security issues, based on the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements.
2) The function of this Council was taken over by the Security Council of Japan in 1986.
3) Article 2 of the Atomic Energy Basic Law states that “The research, development and utilization of
atomic energy shall be limited to peaceful purposes, aimed at ensuring safety and performed
independently under democratic management.”
4) Article 2 of the NPT states that “Each non-nuclear weapon State Party to the Treaty undertakes … not to
manufacture or otherwise acquire nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices … .”
5) The Cabinet’s control over military matters was limited.
6) Members of the Security Council are the Prime Minister (chairman); Minister designated pursuant to
Article 9 of the Cabinet Law (Minister of State pre-designated to perform duties of the Prime Minister
temporarily when the Prime Minister is absent, involved in an accident, or in a similar situation); Minister
of Internal Affairs and Communications; Minister for Foreign Affairs; Minister of Finance; Minister of
Economy, Trade and Industry; Minister of Land, Infrastructure and Transport; Minister of Defense; the
Chief Cabinet Secretary; and Chairman of the National Public Safety Commission. See Fig. III-1-1-2.
7) In addition, to help the Minister of Defense to successfully handle administrative work related to national
defense and to reliably manage the SDF, a system to assist the Minister has been established. See Chapter
3, Section 3 for the organization of the SDF, including assistance to the Minister.

Section 1. Basic Concepts of Formulating National Defense Program Guidelines

The National Defense Program Guidelines show basic principles of Japan’s security policy and the basic
guidelines of Japan’s defense capability in the future including significance and roles of the defense capability
as well as the specific organization of the SDF and the target levels of major defense equipment to be built up
that are based on these principles and the guidelines.
The National Defense Program Guidelines were formulated twice in the past, once in FY 1976 as the
National Defense Program Guidelines in after FY 1977[1] (NDPG 1976) and another in 1995 as the National
Defense Program Guidelines in and after FY 1996[2] (NDPG 1995). The current guidelines were formulated in
2004 as the National Defense Program Guidelines in and after FY 2005 (NDPG 2004) in order to respond
adequately to the international security climate after the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the United States. This section
will explain about the background, circumstances and the basic concepts of formulating the National Defense
Program Guidelines. (See Reference 11)

**1. Background of Formulating the NDPG**

**1. Changes in International Situation and Diversifying Roles of Military Capability**
After the end of the Cold War, interdependence of states has been deepened and expanded, and with the
advancement of international coordination and cooperation, the likelihood of a global armed conflict has
become slimmer even in comparison with that at the time of formulating NDPG 1995.
On the other hand, complex and diversified regional conflicts have occurred due to territorial, religious and
ethnic issues. Furthermore, responses to new threats and diverse contingencies have become an urgent task for
respective nations and the international community including illegal activities and emergency situations such as
international terrorism as observed in the September 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States (the 9/11
terrorist attacks), proliferation and transfer of weapons of mass destructions and ballistic missiles, and piracy.
Against these backgrounds, to prevent inter-state conflicts, it remains to be important to maintain a
conventional form of deterrence. However, against non-state actors such as international terrorist organizations,
the approach of keeping a conventional form of deterrence does not necessarily work effectively.
In addition, it has become more difficult for a single country to resolve security environment issues, and
stabilizing the international security environment has become a common interest for every country. Therefore,
each country has been making a broad range of efforts to resolve those issues by utilizing various means
including military capabilities, thorough coordination of various measures and with international collaboration.
In this context, the roles of military capabilities have become diversified to include prevention of conflicts and
assistance of reconstruction in addition to their traditional role of deterrence and response to armed conflicts.
Under such circumstances, the United States has been engaged in a variety of activities such as war on
terror and activities to halt the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction while giving consideration to
international collaboration. Depending on the nature of these activities, there have been some instances in
which international cooperative frameworks have been established in the form of “Coalition” that differ from
traditional alliance relations. (See Fig. II-2-1-1)

In the midst of these global changes, the countries in areas surrounding Japan are characterized by diversity
in ethnic groups, religions, political systems, and economic strength; the area also features several major
countries having a complex structure of tangled interests as well as disputes over unification, territorial issues,
and maritime interests. Many countries are also modernizing and improving their military capabilities. In
particular, North Korea is engaged in the development and deployment of weapons of mass destruction and
ballistic missiles and maintenance and reinforcement of its asymmetric military capabilities (large-scale special
forces, and others). In addition, China continues to grow steadily as a major power in the region both politically
and economically. In the military sphere, the country has been modernizing its nuclear/missile forces as well as
its naval/air military capabilities, and seeking to promote space development and expand the scope of its
activities at sea. Continued attention must also be paid to these trends in the future.

**2. Remarkable Developments of Scientific Technologies**
Technological advancements led by the information and communications technologies have not simply sparked
spectacular improvements in combat capabilities, but brought about fundamental transformation of military
powers and have had considerable impact on the defense strategies of each country.

**3. Expansion of the SDF Activities and the Improvement of Japan’s Emergency Response**
**Mechanism**

The SDF’s activities have been diversifying and expanding to include responses to the incidents with
suspicious boats, nuclear accidents, various natural disasters, illegal acts, emergency situations, and
international activities including not only U.N. peacekeeping operations but also cooperation in the
international efforts for preventing and eradicating international terrorism as well as the effort for
reconstructing the nation of Iraq. Through the activities being undertaken in response to these situations, the
coordination with relevant agencies such as police and local communities has been reinforced.


-----

**4. Characteristics of Japan**
Close to major powers of the Eurasian continent, Japan is located at a strategically important position for the
maritime traffic extending from the northeastern part of the continent to the Pacific Ocean. Its territory consists
of a long and thin crescent-shaped archipelago with long coast lines and numerous small islands. Japan’s large
population is confined to a vary narrow territory, its industries and population are concentrated mainly in urban
areas, and a large number of important facilities essential to economic development are in coastal areas, all of
which can be considered in terms of topology as vulnerabilities. Due to the geographical, geological and
climate conditions, Japan is also prone to natural disasters of various kinds.
In addition, stability in the international security environment is essential for Japan’s stability and
development which are based on a market-based economic system and free trade. Above all, Japan depends on
imports for many resources it uses as the country relies on the Middle East for nearly 90% of crude oil it
consumes, and the maintenance of the security of sea traffic, and stable utilization of the seas are extremely
important for the country.

**2. Circumstances for Formulating the National Defense Program Guidelines**
In light of the changes in the security environment surrounding Japan as described above, the current National
Defense Program Guidelines were formulated in December 2004. Circumstances for formulating the current
National Defense Program Guidelines are shown in Fig. II-2-1-2.


**Fig. II-2-1-2 Major Study Made before Formulation of National Defense Program Guidelines**

Study made within Defense Agency (then) (Defense Posture Review Board) (Sept. 2001–Dec. 2004)

Based on changes in the security environment surrounding Japan, the Defense Posture Review Board was set up under the
Minister of State for Defense. The board studied matters related to how Japan’s defense capability should be in the future from
wider viewpoints.

Based on that study, the Government at its Cabinet meeting in December 2003 approved a policy “on Introduction of Ballistic
Missile Defense System and Other Measures.” The policy explicitly called for Japan to review its defense capability in the future so
that the country can effectively respond to new threats and diverse contingencies[1] and can proactively and on it own initiative
undertake activities aimed at bringing about peace and stability in the international community.

At the Cabinet meeting on the same day, the Government decided to formulate new National Defense Program Guidelines by the
end of 2004[2].

Study made at the Council on Security and Defense Capabilities (Apr. 2004–Oct. 2004)

The Council on Security and Defense Capabilities was set up under the Prime Minister to study from wider viewpoints and
comprehensively how the Government as a whole should do in regard to Japan’s national security and defense capabilities.
The council was designed to collect views and opinions from experts on security, economic and other fields.

In its report[3], the council specified an Integrated Security Strategy, an idea which calls for appropriately combining three
approaches ((1) Japan’s own efforts (2) collaboration with allies (3) collaboration with the international community) in order to
achieve two objectives set for Japan’s national security ((1) defense of Japan (2) prevention of threats through the improvement of
the international security environment).

On Japan’s defense capabilities in the future, the council proposed the country pursue “Multi-Functional and Flexible Defense
Force,” a defense capability in which various defense functions (response to terrorism, response to ballistic-missile attacks and
international collaboration) become possible through flexible use of defense capabilities.

Study made at the Security Council of Japan (Oct. 2004–Dec. 2004)

Based on a Cabinet approval on “on Introduction of Ballistic Missile Defense System and Other Measures” and a report compiled by
the Council on Security and Defense Capabilities, the Security Council of Japan discussed from wider viewpoints and
comprehensively how Japan’s defense capabilities should be. On December 10, 2004, the Security Council of Japan and the Cabinet
approved new National Defense Program Guidelines.

Notes: 1. Under the Cabinet approval, new threats and diverse contingencies are defined as “increased proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and ballistic
missiles, new threats including activities by international terrorist organizations and others, and diverse situations in which peace and security are affected.”

**3. The Basic Concept of the National Defense Program Guidelines**

**1. Two Objectives and Three Approaches**
The purpose of Japan’s security is to protect peace, independence and the territory of Japan, to maintain the
national system based on the freedom and democracy, and to protect the lives and property of the nation.
With the establishment of the trend toward attaching importance to collaboration and cooperation in the
international community and also from a Japanese standpoint of playing a suitable role for the position of our
country to gain the trust of the international community, Japan must independently and proactively make its
own efforts for peace and stability of the international community, which are a prerequisite for Japan’s peace
and independence.
On that occasion, because security threats today are unpredictable, complicated and diverse, it is important
for the government to make swift and appropriate response through systematic collaboration of the securityrelated measures such as those of public security, economy and intelligence, in addition to the promotion of
diplomatic efforts in peace time and effective operation of defense capabilities, to cooperate with the United
States based on the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangement and to promote cooperation with the relevant countries
and international organizations such as the United Nations.
Based on the perception as mentioned above, the National Defense Program Guidelines define the
following two objectives for security:
1) to prevent any threat from reaching Japan, and, in the event that it does, repel it and minimize any damage,
and
2) to improve the international security environment so as to reduce the chances that any threat will reach Japan
in the first place.
In order to achieve the two objectives listed above, three approaches—“Japan’s own efforts,” “cooperation
with alliance partners” and “cooperation with the international community”—are to be combined in an
integrated manner. (See Fig. II-2-1-3)


Against the threat of nuclear weapons, Japan will rely on the U.S. nuclear deterrent and at the same time

will play an active role in the efforts for disarmament and nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction
such as nuclear weapons, and missiles.


-----

**2. New Concept for Defense Capability (Shifting emphasis from “deterrent effects” to “response**
**capability”)**

**(1) Reviewing the Basic Defense Force Concept**
With regard to Japan’s defense capability, NDPG 1976 presented the Basic Defense Force Concept. This
concept is designed to enable Japan to maintain the minimum necessary basic defense capability as an
independent state lest it turns into a power vacuum and becomes a destabilizing factor in the region
surrounding Japan rather than preparing to directly counter a military threat. NDPG 1995 basically followed
this concept.
The Basic Defense Force Concept was reviewed for the following two reasons in line with changes in the
security environment surrounding Japan.

**a. Effective Response to Contingencies**
Under the Basic Defense Force Concept, a focus is placed on the idea of preventing invasion by possessing an
adequate scale of defense capability in addition to relying on the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements. Behind
the idea is deterrent effect being generated due to a country having defense capability. However, the new
threats and diverse contingencies are difficult to predict and can occur unexpectedly, and conventional
deterrent effects, which derive from the presence of defense force, do not necessarily work effectively.
Therefore, the defense capabilities in the future are strongly expected to have ability meant to prevent such
threats from surfacing, and to have ability to enable effective response to various contingencies and to
minimize damage when such events occur.

**b. Proactive Efforts, on Japan’s Own Initiative, for International Peace Cooperation Activities**
The Basic Defense Force Concept is based on the assumption that while it is internationally recognized that the
efforts for stable international relationship will continue in spite of the existence of unpredictable and uncertain
elements, Japan will not turn into a power vacuum and become a destabilizing factor for the surrounding
region. Meanwhile, mutually cooperative and interdependent relationship among nations has been advancing in
the current international community, and the new threats and diverse contingencies are difficult for one nation
to resolve.
Under these circumstances, Japan, in order to ensure its security, must proactively participate in
international collaborative activities for the improvement of the international security environment
(international peace cooperation activities) on its own initiative by utilizing its defense capabilities.
In other words, it has become difficult to build defense capabilities based solely on Japan’s Basic Defense
Force Concept that focuses on the defense of Japan by not turning into a power vacuum and becoming a
destabilizing factor for the surrounding region.

**(2) Multifunctional, Flexible and Effective Defense Capabilities**
With regard to the future defense capabilities, the National Defense Program Guidelines state that the effective
portion of the Basic Defense Force Concept shall be succeeded[3] under the new security environment, and with
these capabilities Japan shall be able to respond to the new threats and diverse contingencies effectively while
proactively participating in the international peace cooperation activities on its own initiative.
While expected roles of the defense capability are becoming diverse, decline of young population with
dwindling child birthrates and dramatic increase of severity in Japan’s fiscal conditions need to be considered
as we plan to build the future defense capabilities.


-----

Based on this viewpoint, Japan’s future defense capability needs to be equipped with high responsiveness,
mobility, flexibility and multi-purpose functionality, and supported by advanced technology and intelligence
capabilities measuring up to the trend of military technology standard, so that it can become “multi-functional,
flexible and effective defense capabilities” that can effectively respond to various contingencies through
flexible operation of SDF units and defense equipment with multi-functionalities.
Thus Japan’s defense capability is required to shift its emphasis from pursuing conventional deterrence
effects to acquiring abilities to respond to various contingencies at home and abroad.


-----

Section 2. Contents of the National Defense Program Guidelines

This section will explain about Japan’s basic security policy, its vision for the future defense capability and
specific mechanisms for its defense capabilities that are stipulated under the National Defense Program
Guidelines.

**1. Basic Principles of Japan’s Security Policy**
As described earlier, there are two objectives for Japan’s security: to prevent any threats from reaching Japan
or repel them; and to improve the international security environment so as to reduce the chances that any threat
will reach Japan.
Japan will achieve these objectives by combining “Japan’s own efforts,” “cooperation with alliance
partners” and “cooperation with the international community” in an integrated manner.

**1. Japan’s Own Efforts**
Japan’s security depends first and foremost on its own efforts. Based on this recognition, it is stated in the
National Defense Program Guidelines that Japan will make its utmost efforts, by utilizing all available means,
to prevent any threat from reaching the country directly. The guidelines state that in the event that these efforts
failed to prevent the threat from reaching Japan, the Government of Japan would take an integrated response by
swiftly making appropriate decisions, bringing together all relevant organizations, and having them cooperate
adequately. This is based on the recognition that it is important to mobilize the total national power by
collecting the capabilities of relevant organizations such as the SDF, police and Japan Coast Guard in order to
ensure the safety of the nation and the people. In addition, the Government will establish necessary civil
defense systems to respond to various emergency situations, and the central and local governments will work
closely together to establish adequate systems.
At the same time, Japan will engage in its own diplomatic activities to prevent the emergence of threats by
improving international security environment.
The guidelines say that Japan’s defense capabilities, which are the ultimate guarantee of the national
security, shall be multi-functional, flexible, and effective, and the improvement of efficiency and
rationalization are necessary in order to realize such capabilities.

**2. Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements (Cooperation with Allies)**
Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements are indispensable in ensuring Japan’s security, and the presence of the U.S.
military is essential for the maintenance of peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region. Considering the
progress made in Japan-U.S. cooperation in dealing with global issues as exemplified in the fight against
terrorism, close Japan-U.S. cooperative relationship plays a significant role in the effective promotion of the
international efforts to prevent and respond to the new threats and diverse contingencies.
The function of the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements is not granted by simply having the agreement
called the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between Japan and the United States. In order to make
the agreement effective, it is essential to make restless efforts in peacetime. Based on this viewpoint, the
National Defense Program Guidelines clearly specify the following efforts.

**(1) Implementation of Strategic Dialogue between Japan and the United States (strategic**
**objectives, role-sharing, and military posture)**

Based on the posture of Japan’s security and defense capabilities clarified in the National Defense Program
Guidelines, Japan will proactively engage in strategic dialogues with the United States on wide-ranging


-----

security issues such as role-sharing between the two countries and military posture while working to harmonize
our perceptions of the new security environment and appropriate strategic objectives[4]. In doing so, the
Government of Japan will bear in mind the need to reduce the excessive burden on local communities which
host U.S. military facilities and areas, while maintaining the deterrent capabilities that the U.S. military
presence in Japan provides.

**(2) Various Efforts for Strengthening of the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements**
The Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements shall be enhanced through active promotion of measures including
information sharing, various operational cooperation, and collaboration on ballistic missile defense (BMD).

**3. Cooperation with the International Community**
The National Defense Program Guidelines state that in order to improve the international security environment
as part of cooperation with the international community and help maintain security and prosperity of Japan, the
Government of Japan will actively engage in diplomatic efforts, including the strategic use of Official
Development Assistance (ODA). It is also stated in the guidelines that based on the recognition that the
destabilization of the international community by events such as regional conflicts, proliferation of weapons of
mass destruction, and international terrorist attacks would directly affect its own peace and security, Japan will,
on its own initiative, proactively participate in international peace cooperation activities as an integral part of
its diplomatic efforts.
In particular, stability in the regions spreading from the Middle East to East Asia is crucial to Japan. Thus,
the Government of Japan will strive to stabilize the region by promoting cooperative efforts, in conjunction
with other countries concerned, to deal with common security challenges. And Japan will actively engage in
the U.S. reform, and also promote the efforts for multilateral frameworks for security in the Asia-Pacific region
such as the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF).

**2. Vision for the Future Defense Capability**

**1. Role of the Defense Capability**
In recognition of new security environment, the National Defense Program Guidelines defines the role of the
defense capability as;
1) effective response to the new threats and diverse contingencies
2) preparation to deal with full-scale invasion
3) proactive efforts, on Japan’s own initiative, to improve the international security environment
The guidelines say that Japan will efficiently maintain the SDF posture which is deemed necessary to
effectively carry out missions in each area.
NDPG 1995 clearly states the maintenance of defense posture of each SDF. But the current National
Defense Program Guidelines adopts the idea that a new SDF posture should be formed in the process of joint
operation being conducted to respond to each contingency. Based on the idea, the guidelines, under “the Role
of the Defense Capabilities,” specify the role and response to be fulfilled in each contingency and the concept
of SDF posture in a comprehensive manner.

**(1) Effective Response to New Threats and Diverse Contingencies**
The idea behind responses to new threats and diverse contingencies presented in the National Defense Program
Guidelines is as follows.
As new threats and diverse contingencies are difficult to predict and have potential for sudden outbreak,
Japan will cope effectively with them by forming and deploying highly ready and mobile defense force units


-----

capable of responding properly to the characteristics of each situation in accordance with the characteristics of
the units and Japan’s geographical characteristics. When contingencies actually happen, the defense force will
act quickly and appropriately to seamlessly respond to the situations in smooth and close collaboration with the
police, Japan Coast Guard and other relevant organizations in accordance with the circumstances and the need
for division of labor.
Major responses to new threats and diverse contingencies are as follows.

**a. Response to Ballistic Missile Attacks**
Japan has started the development of a BMD system, for which introduction was approved in December 2003.
The country will establish a system to counter missile attacks, including one approved in 2003, at an early date
in order to deal effectively with such attacks.
Japan will appropriately deal with nuclear threats with efforts to build the BMD system as well as relying
on the U.S. nuclear deterrent. (See Part III, Chapter 1, Section 2-1)

**b. Response to Attacks by Guerrillas or Special Operations Forces**
Guerrillas and special forces attacks are difficult to predict, and we need to be prepared to deal with such
attacks without delay and to prevent the expansion of such attacks. Therefore, Japan will maintain necessary
defense force structure to effectively respond to the situation by enhancing the readiness and mobility of
defense force units, as well as by coping with such attacks in a flexile manner including swift and concentrated
deployment of the units. (See Part III, Chapter 1, Section 2-2)

**c. Response to the Invasion of Japan’s**
**Offshore Islands**

Because of Japan’s geographical characteristic
featuring many offshore islands, invasion of such
islands is envisioned as a form of armed attacks
against Japan.
In order to respond to such invasion, it is
necessary for Japan to maintain a defense structure
which is capable of effectively dealing with preciseguidance attacks by transporting SDF units by sea
and air in a flexible manner. (See Part III, Chapter 1,

Troops of GSDF’s First Infantry Regiment (based in Tokyo) conducting combat Section 2-3)
exercise in U.S. state of Hawaii

**d. Patrol and Surveillance in Sea and Airspace Surrounding Japan, and Response to Violation**
**of Japan’s Airspace and the Intrusion of Armed Spy Ships and Other Vessels**

In order to effectively respond to the new threats and diverse contingencies, detecting the signal at an early
stage is extremely important for preventing the unwanted event as well as preventing the expansion of such
event when it occurs. Therefore, around-the-clock patrol and surveillance in the sea and airspace surrounding
Japan remain an important role of the SDF, and thus Japan will maintain the defense structure that consists of
warships, aircraft and other necessary equipment.
Japan will also maintain fighter aircraft units to respond instantly and adequately to the violation of
territorial airspace. Furthermore, in light of issues concerning North Korean armed spy vessels and the
submerged navigation within Japan’s territory by Chinese nuclear submarines, Japan will take adequate actions


-----

against such spy ships in the waters surrounding Japan and submerged foreign submarines navigating in
Japan’s territorial waters. (See Part III, Chapter 1, Section 2-4)

**e. Response to Large-Scale and Special-Type Disasters**
Japan is under the conditions that are prone to natural disasters such as earthquake, typhoon, and volcanic
eruption, and in the event of unconventional disasters such as nuclear disasters and terrorism, utilization of the
SDF capabilities may become necessary.
In such circumstances, ensuring the security of the people is extremely important, and Japan will maintain
an adequate force structure consisting of defense force units and people with specialized capabilities and
expertise who can conduct disaster-relief operations in any part of Japan in order to deal swiftly with largescale disasters and special-type disasters, where protection of life and property is needed. (See Part III, Chapter
1, Section 2-5)

**(2) Preparations for Full-Scale Invasion**
While likelihood of full-scale invasion is declining, the new defense capabilities are required for Japan to
effectively respond to the new threats and diverse contingencies as well as proactive engagement on its own
initiative aimed at improving the international security environment.
In recognition of such security environment, it is stated in the National Defense Program Guidelines that
Japan will depart from its defense build-up concept that emphasizes so-called Cold War-type counter-armor
warfare, anti-submarine warfare and anti-air warfare, and will make a sweeping review of its defense
equipment and personnel earmarked for coping with full-scale invasion with an eye toward reducing them.
At the same time, in light of the fact that the primary role of defense capability is to respond to full-scale
invasion and that the rearrangement of defense build-up cannot be achieved in a short time, Japan will secure
the most fundamental part of its defense capability in order to prepare for full-scale invasion. (See Part III,
Chapter 1, Section 3)

**(3) Proactive Efforts on Japan’s Own Initiative to Improve the International Security**
**Environment**
**a. Proactive Engagement on its Own Initiative in International Peace Cooperation Activities**
In NDPG 1995, “contributing to the development of stable security environment” was defined as one of the
roles of defense capabilities and the SDF has participated in various international peace cooperation activities.
It is stated in the National Defense Program Guidelines that Japan will proactively participate in
international peace cooperation activities on its own initiative, with the objective of further ensuring peace and
security of Japan, rather than simply making “contribution.”
The scope of international peace cooperation
activities is very wide and the Government of Japan
as a whole needs to be engaged in these activities in
an integrated manner with diplomacy as part of the
country’s unified diplomatic efforts that involve not
only the SDF but also civilian activities. Within the
framework of the Government’s total policy, the SDF
must be engaged in international peace cooperation
activities appropriately using its self-sufficiency
ability and organizational capabilities, and for that
reason, the SDF plans to establish necessary

ASDF C-130H transport plane engaging in international peace cooperation activity


-----

infrastructure to quickly dispatch and maintain defense force units overseas by developing education and
training systems, maintaining highly ready force posture for relevant units and improving transport and other
required capabilities.
In order for Japan to appropriately participate in international peace cooperation activities, it was
determined that necessary arrangements would be made including the effort to properly put these activities
within the SDF mission priorities. (See Chapter 3, Section 2-3)

**b. Security Dialogues and Promotion of Defense Exchanges**
Security dialogues and defense exchanges including bilateral and multilateral training need to be continued in
view of the changes in the international security environment and in recognition of the fact that such efforts
effectively contribute to an effective implementation of international peace cooperation activities. In addition,
the activities to contribute to peace and stability of the international community need to be actively promoted
by continuing the implementation of cooperative activities in the areas of arms control and disarmament
conducted by international organizations including the United Nations. (See Part III, Chapter 3, Section 2 •
Section 3)

**2. Fundamental Elements for Japan’s Defense Capabilities**
Following are fundamental elements of Japan’s defense capabilities that are included in the National Defense
Program Guidelines in order to fulfill defense missions described above.

**(1) Enhancement of Joint Operation Capabilities**
In order to execute its missions swiftly and effectively by responding to the new threats and diverse
contingencies without delay in the new security environment, the SDF needs to enhance the joint operational
posture that enables all SDF services to be operated in a unified manner from the beginning of the outbreak of
such situations.
For the transition into such joint operational posture, establishment of the Joint Staff Office as an
organization to assist the then Director-General of the SDF who was responsible for its operations was
incorporated in the National Defense Program Guidelines. As well as enhancing the effectiveness of the Joint
Staff Office, the infrastructure for the SDF’s joint operations is to be established in such areas as education and
training, and information and communications. In strengthening its joint operation capabilities, the SDF is to
reexamine its existing organizations so as to enhance their efficiency. (See Part III, Chapter 1, Section 1-5)

**(2) Strengthening Intelligence Capabilities**
In order for the defense capability to function effectively with multiple functionality and flexibility, it is
imperative for the Government of Japan to retain and utilize advanced intelligent capabilities including the
ability to detect signs of a contingency at an early time and to collect, analyze and share intelligence promptly
and accurately.
Intelligence capabilities are not a simple auxiliary element, but should be positioned as one essential
element in the defense system. For this reason, Japan will strengthen its advanced and diversified intelligencecollection capability and enhance its comprehensive analysis and assessment capabilities, keeping in mind the
dangers in the security environment and technological trends. Japan will also strengthen the intelligence
structure, including the Defense Intelligence Headquarters that is to play a role of supporting such capabilities.
In this way, Japan will build a sophisticated intelligence capability.


-----

**(3) Incorporating the Progress of Science and Technology in Japan’s Defense Capabilities**
In order to realize multi-functional, flexible and effective defense capabilities, the fruits of various
technological innovations due to the progress of information and science technology should also be reflected
adequately.
In particular, advance command and communications systems, and information communications network
shall be established to develop reliable command and control systems as well as speedy intelligence-sharing
systems, which are indispensable for the SDF’s joint operations described earlier, in tune with advanced
information and communication technologies available at home and abroad.

**(4) Effective Utilization of Human Resources**
In order to achieve greater outcome with limited human resources, it is necessary to recruit human resources
with high potential, and train and educate them in order for the SDF to adequately cope with diversification and
internationalization of SDF missions, and to properly operate rapidly advancing high-tech defense equipment.
Research and education on security issues are to be promoted and the foundation of manpower for
promoting such research is to be reinforced[5].

**3. Specific Posture for Defense Capability**
An attached table of the National Defense Program Guidelines clarifies a specific posture for defense
capabilities to fulfill the missions described above. The following is its outline.

**1. Ground Self-Defense Force**

-----

As regionally deployed units (basic strategic units), eight divisions and six brigades featuring responsiveness
and high mobility are formed in preparation for effective response to the new threats and diverse contingencies,
which requires timely actions but are difficult to predict the occurrence, and eight divisions and six brigades
will be placed in each of the 14 sections created with consideration given to Japan’s geographical
characteristics featuring mountains, rivers and straits. (See Fig. II-2-2-1)

**(2) Securing Personnel Resources (Manpower)**
a. Departing from the conventional anti-tank warfare-oriented defense build-up concept, “personnel
(manpower)”-oriented system will be built to enhance the response to the new threats and diverse
contingencies such as attacks by guerrillas and special operations forces and large-scale disasters, as well as
to the need for international peace cooperation activities.

b. To secure effective response capability, the number of regular defense officers will be increased from
145,000 in NDPG 1995 to 148,000.

c. On the other hand, the number of primary equipment—tanks and artilleries—will be reduced from
approximately 900 vehicles to 600 vehicles for tanks, and from 900 to 600 artillery/vehicles for artillery.
(See Fig. II-2-2-2)

**(3) New Formation of Central Readiness Force and International Peace Cooperation Activities**
**Training Unit**

In order to prevent the expansion of various contingencies when they occur, the Central Readiness Force will
be newly organized, consisting of Mobile Operation Units and various specialized units. Within this force, the


-----

International Peace Cooperation Activities Training Unit will be newly organized for proactive engagement on
its own initiative in international peace cooperation activities. (See Part III, Chapter 1, Section 2-2)

**2. Maritime Self-Defense Force**

**(1) Posture of New Destroyer Units for More Effective Response**
In order to secure as many well-trained destroyers as possible within a limited number of vessels and to enable
prompt response to diverse contingencies, destroyer units will be formed in accordance with the level of
training rather than the conventional fixed formation.
Mobile Operation Units will be integrated into eight divisions (One division consisting of four vessels) to
enable swift and continuous response to contingencies. The formation of Regional District Units will be
transformed so that one unit is deployed in a five patrol district in view of the current security environment.
(See Section 4, Fig. II-2-4-2)

**(2) Formation of Submarine Units Focusing on Response to New Threats and Diverse**
**Contingencies**

Submarine units will continue to retain a total of 16 submarines (Units are to be integrated from six divisions
(two or three vessels for each division) to four divisions (four vessels for each division). The new formation of
submarines, to be deployed in important maritime traffic points in East China Sea and the Sea of Japan in order
to gather information, is intended to detect signs of new threats and diverse contingencies at the earliest
possible time for taking flexible actions.

**(3) Improving the Efficiency of Combat Aircraft Unit**
While ensuring the surveillance system for surrounding sea, responsiveness and effectiveness, the number of
combat aircraft (including patrol aircraft, minesweeping and transportation helicopters) will be reduced from
approximately 170 to 150 due to the units’ integration and efficiency improvement.
For the fixed-wing patrol aircraft units, P-3C successor aircraft (P-X) with improved performance will be
introduced, and the current eight squadrons will be integrated into four squadrons for better efficiency. The
patrol helicopter units will be integrated from eight squadrons into five squadrons by changing operations of all
the helicopters basically vessel-based, from the viewpoint of achieving efficient operation. (See Section 4, Fig.
II-2-4-3)

**3. Air Self-Defense Force**

**(1) Improving the Efficiency of Fighter Aircraft Units**
Fighter Aircraft Units will remain as major units in order to take appropriate actions in a timely manner against
the violation of airspace, but the number of fighter aircraft will be changed from approximately 300 to 260
through the improvement of operational efficiency in light of the declined possibility of full-scale invasion of
Japan.
The number of combat aircraft including fighters will be changed from approximately 400 to 350 in line
with, for example, the downsizing of Air Reconnaissance Unit. (See Fig. II-2-2-3)

next transport aircraft (C-X) with transport and aviation performance superior to the current aircraft will be
prepared. (See Fig. II-2-2-4)

**(3) Airborne Early-Warning Group into Two Groups**
The Airborne Early-Warning Group will be reorganized into two groups from one group planned under NDPO
1995 through functional separation into E-767 and E-2C units.

**4. Major Equipment and Major Units that can be also Available for Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD)**

The National Defense Program Guidelines state that
the posture of the SDF must be capable of taking on
various roles to deal with diverse tasks. In particular,
it was judged to be important for Japan to try to
attain understanding for the BMD system both inside
and outside of Japan by clarifying the system as
specific as possible and ensuring its transparency. To
that end, the guidelines, in its attached table, specify
“major equipment and major units that can be also
available for ballistic missile defense.”[6] (See Fig. II2-2-5)

|---|---|---|---|---|



Note: Under the Mid-Term Defense Program, the Defense Ministry calls for the number of regular personnel of the SDF to be kept at the current level in view of
the need for Japan to effectively respond to new threats and diverse contingencies and to commit itself to international peace cooperation activities
proactively and on its own initiative. Specifically, the program says that the number of such personnel should be roughly about 146,000.


-----

**4. Additional Elements for Consideration**
The National Defense Program Guidelines state that the following elements will be taken into consideration in
building up, maintaining and operating defense capability.

**1. Fiscal Conditions, Procurement of Defense Equipment and Maintenance and Operation of**
**Defense Facilities**

Given severe fiscal conditions, defense expenditures need to be curbed by further rationalizing and
streamlining defense forces, and the overall defense capability needs to function smoothly and sufficiently by
making its operations harmonious with other measures taken by the Government.
In addition, the Government will make following efforts: promotion of measures to curb the life-cycle cost[7]

in procuring defense equipment, implementation of effective and efficient research and development activities,
as well as the allocation of limited resources to core technological fields for the establishment of a truly
necessary defense production system and technological foundation.
In order to efficiently maintain and upgrade Japan’s defense-related facilities, the Government will take
various measures to make these facilities coexist more harmoniously with local communities.

**2. Timeframe for Achieving Defense Capability Objectives and Its Review**
While NDPG 1976 and NDPG 1995 do not specify the timing for achieving the objectives of defense
capability, the National Defense Program Guidelines provides the clear vision for Japan’s defense capability
for the next decade, based on the idea that it is important to show concrete timing for achieving the goals of
defense capability more clearly.
It is desirable for Japan to review its defense vision on a regular basis in line with the security environment
and technological trends. Based on this idea, the National Defense Program Guidelines will be reviewed and, if
necessary, will be revised after fives years or in case that there is a significant change in the security
environment, taking into consideration such change in the environment, technological progress, and other
relevant factors at the time.

**5. Three Principles on Arms Exports**
A statement by the Chief Cabinet Secretary released at the time of the formulation of the National Defense
Program Guidelines addressed issues on arms export control. It stated that given the fact that ballistic missile
defense (BMD) would contribute to the effective implementation of the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements and
from the viewpoint of contributing to the security of Japan, the Government would exempt items related to
BMD systems from the regulations of the Three Principles on Arms Export and related provisions, on the
condition that those items would come under strict export control[8]. (See Reference 13 • Reference 44)
In addition, with regard to cases of joint development and production with the United States as well as
cases seen as contributing to counter-terrorism and counter-piracy, regarding which questions were raised
through the process of developing the National Defense Program Guidelines, it mentioned that the Government
would decide, on a case-by-case basis, whether to take any actions in the future, taking into consideration the
basic principle, as a peace-loving nation, of avoiding exacerbation of international conflicts[9].
The statement by the Chief Cabinet Secretary clarified that Japan would continue to firmly maintain its
policy of dealing carefully with arms exports control in light of the country’s basic philosophy as a peaceful
country, which is the basis for the Three Principles on Arms Exports and their related policy guidelines.

Section 3. Mid-Term Defense Program

National defense is a basis of the existence of the country. Therefore, defense built-up is ultimately made based
on the budget of each fiscal year. But defense should be built up continuously, systematically and steadily
based on the security environment surrounding Japan and the role of defense capability, and also in line with a
concrete medium-term outlook, because research and development of defense equipment, its adoption,
improvement of facilities, education of defense personnel, and training of SDF units cannot be realized in a
short term.
Therefore, the Government of Japan has devised mid-term defense programs, each covering five years,
since FY 1986, and has built up the nation’s defense on such programs compiled for every fiscal year.
The “Mid-Term Defense Program (FY 2005-FY 2009)” is a plan which defines Japan’s policy regarding
build-up of its defense capabilities and main projects for five years to realize new defense capabilities specified
in the National Defense Program Guidelines. The program was approved by the Security Council and the
Cabinet in December 2004. (See Reference 12)
This section will explain policies envisaged under the Mid-Term Defense Program, organizational reviews
of the Defense Ministry and the SDF, main projects related to the SDF’s capability and measures meant to
reinforce the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements.

**1. Policies for the Program**
In line with the National Defense Program Guidelines, the Mid-Term Defense Program has shifted its priority
from “deterrence by presence” to “effective response” and has placed an emphasis on the improvement of
readiness and mobility, an integrated operation of the GSDF, the MSDF and the ASDF through their joint
operations and the acquirement of new capabilities in line with technological development. Six policies, listed
below, are the basis of the program intended to build up Japan’s defense capability appropriately.
1) Establishment of multi-functional, flexible and effective defense capabilities
2) Organizational reviews of the Defense Ministry and the SDF
3) Enhancement of fundamental defense capabilities through joint operations and strengthening of intelligence
functions
4) Promotion of various measures that support defense capabilities, such as rational and efficient procurement
of defense equipment
5) Further strengthening of Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements
6) Efforts to make defense capabilities efficient and streamlined

**2. Review of Organizations of Defense Ministry and SDF**
The Mid-Term Defense Program calls for organizational reviews of the Defense Ministry and the SDF, as
shown below, as a means of swiftly and efficiently transforming their structure into one in which new defense
capabilities envisaged under the National Defense Program Guidelines can be acquired.
1) Ideal structure of internal bureaus will be studied in order to improve and strengthen organizations in charge
of administrative defense policies, and necessary measures will be taken.
2) The Joint Staff Office will be newly established while the existing Staff Offices of the three SDF services
will be reorganized, both to reinforce the joint operations posture. Based on the achievements of joint
operations, how to make such operations effective will be studied, and necessary measures will be taken.
The Defense Intelligence Headquarters will be placed under the direct control of the then DirectorGeneral of the Defense Agency. (See Chapter 3, Section 3)


-----

3) The GSDF, the MSDF and the ASDF will shift to the structure shown in Fig. II-2-2-5 under the previous
section, when the Mid-Term Defense Program is concluded.

**3. Main Projects Concerning Capabilities of the SDF**
Concerning the SDF’s defense capabilities, the MidTerm Defense Program calls for effective response to
new threats and diverse contingencies, preparations
against full-scale invasion of Japan, proactive efforts,
on Japan’s own initiative, to help improve the
international security environment, and promotion of
fundamental defense capabilities and various
measures that support such capabilities. Under the
program, main projects as shown in Figure II-2-3-1
will be implemented in order to achieve these goals.

**4. Measures to Strengthen Japan-U.S.** Mobile combat vehicle (concept)
**Security Arrangements**

Under the new security environment, following measures will be taken in order to further strengthen the JapanU.S. Security Arrangements and close relationship with the United States backed by the arrangements.
1) Exchange of information and views on the international situation will be enhanced, and strategic dialogue on
the general security situation will be continued.
2) Efforts will be made to establish an effective cooperative framework in the field of defense operations. In
addition, joint exercises and training will be enhanced.
3) Cooperation in the field of ballistic missile defense (BMD) will be promoted further.
4) Efforts will be made to promote wide-ranging mutual exchanges in the fields of defense equipment and
technologies.
5) Measures will be taken to make stationing of U.S. forces in Japan smooth and effective.
6) Japan will proactively participate in international security efforts and will take measures to enable close

Section 4. Defense Build-Up Program for FY 2007

In FY 2007, build-up of Japan’s defense capability will be promoted more efficiently by strengthening its
policy-formulating function and establishing a defense organization that can respond to challenges in a new
era. In addition, defense build-up being planned for the year will also emphasize how to respond to new threats
and various other contingent situations, including the improvement of a counter-missile capability,
information-gathering ability and patrol and surveillance ability, all of them responding in the wake of a
ballistic missile launch and a nuclear test by North Korea, and countering attacks being launched by terrorists,
guerrillas and special-operations units.
Major items being planned for the FY 2007 defense built-up program are shown in Figure II-2-4-1. (See

**COMMENTARY**

**Organization of the Self-Defense Forces Command and Communication Unit**
**(Tentative Name)**

After the Self-Defense Forces was transferred to a new joint operations structure in March last year, SDF
realized, while operating forces in Japan and abroad, the importance of not only the “static” part of the
information communication functions of SDF, such as the development and maintenance of information
systems and networks, but also the “dynamic” functions that are more directly related to the operation of
forces. Such “dynamic” functions include speedy coordination between the headquarters and local forces
and between forces in a wide area.
With this as a background, it has been decided that the “static” functions performed by the Joint Staff
Office, such as the maintenance of the Central Command Post (CCP), SDF’s commanding center, and the
Defense Information Infrastructure (DII), SDF’s backbone network, as well as the protection against cyber
attacks, will be reorganized and placed under the control of a new unit. Since the unit (tentatively named
“SDF Command and Communication Unit”) will support activities of all the Ground, Marine and Air
Self-Defense Forces, it will become SDF’s first permanent joint operation unit in charge of supporting
information communication.
In addition to taking over the maintenance operations of CCP and DII from the Joint Staff Office, the
SDF Command and Communication Unit will also build a common communication system that suits the
circumstances of the time by organically combining the communication infrastructures of the Ground,
Marine and Air Self-Defense Forces, recover communication quickly and sufficiently at the time of a
cyber attack, and play other important roles.
Since there had been no framework for permanent joint units across more than two self-defense forces,
the Self-Defense Forces Law was amended to newly establish the framework for “Joint Units” that is
similar to the existing framework for “Joint Organizations[1],” considering the need to realize new smoother
joint operations.

**[COLUMN]**


**COMMENTARY**

**New Equipment (New Destroyer)**

The Marine Self-Defense Force will add a 5,000 ton-class destroyer to its fleet under the FY 2007 budget
as a substitute for a destroyer that is expected to withdraw in FY 2011.
According to the future plan outlined by the National Defense Program Guidelines, MSDF is required
to possess eight destroyer units for mobile operations, each consisting of four vessels. The guidelines also
require that four of these eight units consist of one Aegis guided missile destroyer (DDG) and three multi-
mission destroyers (DD) with the DDG playing the core part of each formation to focus on air defense
capabilities including ballistic missile defense (BMD) operations.
The destroyer planned to be added during FY 2007 (19 DD) will join one of these four units in
accordance with the air defense plan of the Mid-term Defense Program, and its major mission is to guard
the DDG against possible air attacks (Local Area Defense) while the DDG is engaged in BMD operations.
In addition to defending the DDG, the new destroyer is also planned to be fully equipped with anti-
submarine and anti-surface warfare capabilities so that it can effectively respond to the newly emerging
threats and diverse contingencies and even resist an attempt of a full-scale invasion.
The specific equipment to be mounted on the new destroyer includes (1) surface-to-air Evolved Sea
Sparrow Missiles (ESSM), (2) the most advanced antiaircraft Active Phased Array Radar (the enhanced
version of FCS-3, the fire control system to be mounted on helicopter destroyers (DDH) commissioned in
2004 and 2006), which can be upgraded according to the future development of semiconductor
technology, and (3) the upper structure designed to be as stealthy as possible.

Section 5. Defense-Related Expenditures

Defense-related expenditures include spending for maintaining and managing the SDF, improving living
conditions in the neighborhood of defense facilities, supporting U.S. forces stationed in Japan and managing
the Security Council.
Defense-related budget for FY 2007 was significantly curbed with spending items in general becoming
subject to reduction, as the fiscal year marked the first year of the Government’s initiative to streamline
expenditures and revenues in a unified manner. As a result, such budget for the year decreased for five years in
a row on an expenditure basis, by ¥8.8 billion or 0.2% from the preceding fiscal year, excluding costs related to
the Special Action Committee on Okinawa (SACO) and costs associated with measures to reduce the burden of
local communities hosting U.S. forces stationed in Japan as part of a plan to realign such forces. But the FY
2007 defense budget earmarks necessary spending items, including establishing a necessary framework for
effectively responding to new threats and diverse contingencies such as countering ballistic-missile attacks
against Japan, and the budget is intended to further promote efficient procurement of defense equipment[10].
Including ¥12.6 billion in SACO-related expenses and ¥7.2 billion in expenses related to realignments of
U.S. Forces (portion meant to reduce burden of local communities[11]), Japan’s total defense-related expenditures
for FY 2007 amount to ¥4,801.6 billion, representing a decrease of 0.3% or ¥12.3 billion from the preceding
fiscal year. (See Fig. II-2-5-1) (See Reference 20-21)

**Fig. II-2-5-1 Outline of Defense-Related Expenditures**

|Classification|Col2|FY 2007 Defense-Related Expenditures|
|---|---|---|
|Defense-related expenditures (in case of including SACO-related expenses and U.S. forces realignment-related expenses) Growth from previous fiscal year Ratio against GDP Ratio against general account spending||¥4,781.8 billion (¥4,801.6 billion)|
||Growth from previous fiscal year Ratio against GDP Ratio against general account spending|–0.2% (–0.3%) 0.916% (0.920%) 5.8% (5.8%)|
|Expenses carried over to following fiscal years New contracts Previously contracted||¥2,992.9 billion|
||New contracts Previously contracted|¥1,771.1 billion ¥1.221.8 billion|



**1. Breakdown of Defense-Related Expenditures**

**1. Breakdown by Expenses**
Defense-related expenditures are broadly classified into “personnel and provisions expenses,” which cover
such items as pay and meals for SDF personnel, and “material expenses,” which finance the repair and
maintenance of equipment, purchase of fuel, the education and training of SDF personnel, and the procurement
of equipment and others. Material expenses are further classified into “obligatory outlay expenses,”[12] which are
paid under contracts concluded in past fiscal years, and “general material expenses,” which are paid under
current-year contracts. (See Fig. II-2-5-2)
The Defense Ministry terms this classification method as “classification by expenses.” A breakdown of FY
2007 defense-related expenditures based on this method is shown in Fig. II-2-5-3.
Personnel and provisions expenses and obligatory outlay expenses, both of which are mandatory expenses,
account for 80% or more of the total defense-related budget. A breakdown of general material expenses show


-----

that lasting or mandatory costs account for a significant portion of the total, such as the repair of equipment,
education and training of SDF personnel, the cost of hosting U.S. forces stationed in Japan and expenses[13]

related to measures to alleviate the burden of local communities hosting U.S. bases in Japan.

Personnel and provisions expenses for FY 2007 decreased by ¥31.9 billion or 1.5% from the previous fiscal
year, reflecting smaller payments of retirement allowance due to a decline in the number of retiring personnel.
Obligatory outlay expenses for the year increased by ¥22.3 billion or 1.3% from the previous year and general
material expenses also rose by ¥800 million or 0.1% from the previous year.

Understanding defense expenditures of each country using one standard is not possible in view of differences
from one country to another in their socioeconomic systems and differences of their budget systems. In the
absence of an internationally unified definition, breakdowns of defense expenditures are unclear in many
countries, although they are publicly disclosed. (See Reference 23)
Defense expenditures of one country are generally compared with those of other countries by converting
the value of spending measured in each country’s currency into the dollar-termed value. But defense spending
measured based on this method does not necessarily reflect the precise value that would result from counting
each country’s price levels.
Therefore, making simple comparison between Japan's defense-related expenditures shown in dollar terms
and those of other countries also shown in dollar terms does not make much sense.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) makes comparison between one
country and others of their ability to purchase goods and services by publishing each country’s purchasingpower parity, a gauge meant to measure such ability by taking into account each country’s price levels. A
following table lists defense expenditures of each country shown in dollar terms using OECD data of
purchasing-power parity. (The table excludes Russia and China for which there are no OECD data on
purchasing-power parity) (See Fig. II-2-5-6)

2. Population used to calculate per-capita defense spending is based on a world population white paper compiled by the United Nations. GDP is
based on major economic indicators of foreign countries compiled by the Finance Ministry.

that the joint Japan-U.S. technical research on a sea-based midcourse system of the BMD would be
succeeded by the joint Japan-U.S. development in fiscal 2006. In a statement issued by the Chief Cabinet
Secretary on the same day, it was stated that “weapons that need to be provided to the United States for
the purpose of this joint Japan-U.S. development shall be provided under strict control and also upon
coordination with the United States regarding a framework for provision of weapons.” Following this
statement, “the Exchange of Notes concerning the Transfer of Arms and Military Technologies” was
concluded by the Japanese and the U.S. Governments in June last year. The exchange provides a
framework for enabling the transfer of weapons and weapons technologies designed for the Japan-U.S.
joint BMD development as well as weapon technologies that were subject to transfer under the previous
“Exchange of Notes concerning the Transfer of Military Technologies.” (See Part III, Chapter 1, Section

9) In June 2006, Japan decided to provide patrol vessels, which fall under the category of weapons and
others under the Three Principles on Arms Export, to Indonesia as grant aid meant to support the country
in its efforts to control and prevent terrorism and piracy. A statement issued at that time by the Chief
Cabinet Secretary said the transfer of the patrol vessels were exempted from the Arms Export Three
Principles on the condition that an international agreement is concluded with the recipient country to
ensure that the vessels are not used for purposes other than controlling and preventing terrorism and
piracy and that the country does not transfer the vessels to a third party without Japan’s prior consent.

12) Procurement of some main frontal defense equipment, such as vessels and aircraft, and construction of
accommodations for SDF personnel, take multiple years. Budgeting for procurement of such equipment
and construction of these accommodations is made to allow execution of contracts basically within five
years. A contract being concluded based on such budgeting stipulates that payments to contractors are to
be made at a specified time in the future. The total budget amount for the contract will be then split into
several portions over years for which the contract was made in order to decide the amount of budget
being paid annually to the contractor. Expenses budgeted in the fiscal year when their payment to the
contractor becomes necessary several years after the conclusion of the contract are called “obligatory
outlay expenses” while expenses whose payment period has yet to come are called “expenses carried over
to the following fiscal years.”

residential houses located near U.S. bases.

A new organization for defense
—Building an organization more capable of coping with crises and better able to contribute to world peace—

The defense of Japan means protecting the peace and security of our national territory, culture, liberty,
democracy, and the stability and prosperity of our nation’s livelihood. Our national territory was home to our
predecessors and will be home to our descendents as well. Proud as we are of our long history and our unique
culture and tradition, our land is the stage for the future that must be fostered to thrive. We take pride in being
Japanese and feel a strong affection to this land.
We have inherited from ancestors over a long time not only our land but also our language and customs,
our lifestyles, our history and traditions, our literature, our arts and our attitudes. This national legacy was built
by the dedicated effort of our ancestors who lived here and left to us as their posterity. This handiwork was
produced over a long history through the efforts of Japanese people of every era, and it will undoubtedly go on
in the future. This heritage passes from the past to the present and from the present to the future, gaining depth
each and every time.
Today’s security and prosperity were built on the foundation of this national legacy formed by our
forefathers’ endeavors. We must maintain this security and prosperity in independence and peace not merely
for our own era but for those of our children, grandchildren, and so on for eternity.
Defending the country is the responsibility of each and every one of us, and we cannot be said to have
fulfilled our duty if we do not accumulate the fruits of our efforts and pass them on to the next generation.
Since the foundation of its predecessor the Defense Agency, the Ministry of Defense has had responsibility
for the defense of Japan in living up to the expectations and trust of the Japanese public. More than 1,700
members of the Self Defense Force have died, their life’s ambitions cut short, in the course of performing their
duties. The defense of our country is a noble national mission with direct relevance to people’s lives. To carry
out this assignment, each and every one of approximately 270,000 members of the SDF must undertake their
day-to-day duties with a strong sense of their difficult mission to pass down today’s prosperity to their
descendents for all eternity.
National defense has never lost such significance.
The international security environment has changed greatly since the Defense Agency was established.
Today’s security environment features increasingly diverse and complex threats, and it has become
increasingly difficult to predict when and where these threats will arise. International terrorist organizations
and other non-state entities have skillfully utilized the progressing globalization of society through
development in the field of information and communication technologies and transportation to carry out
indiscriminate attacks against persons and property regardless of national borders. The proliferation of nuclear,
biological, chemical and other weapons of mass destruction as well as ballistic missiles and other delivery
systems for WMDs has also become a major threat. Serious concerns have arisen that such weapons might fall
into the hands of international terrorist organizations.
Changes in the security environment have made changes in the roles demanded of military forces, and
many countries are pursuing reform of their military organization. The tremendous progress made in
information technology (IT) in recent years has stimulated the United States and other countries to undertake
military technology research. These movements have made advancements in biotechnology, cyber security,
cutting-edge technology such as space weapons, precision guidance technology and unmanned technology.
Efforts are also being made to upgrade intelligence gathering, special operations, and other capabilities.
Substantial economic, social, technological and other changes are emerging in today’s world. Advances in
information and communication technologies allow information to pass across national borders and be
conveyed around the world instantly. More sophisticated means of transportation allow people and goods to


-----

pass back and forth frequently across national borders. Knowledge from all over the world is linked to generate
a synergistic effect that produces new knowledge, which in turn sparks a variety of changes. The speed of
communication is accelerating these changes.
These diverse changes have had an impact on states and on the security environment, and changes in the
security environment leads defense to change its stance and role.
These changes in the security environment means that we no longer live in an age in which defense
capabilities are designed only around deterring invasions. Instead, we live in an era requiring that we confront a
variety of problems arising both inside and outside Japan, protect the lives and property of the Japanese people,
and act for the sake of world peace in cooperation with other countries. Globalization has stripped traditional
meaning from national borders, and Japan’s responsibilities today include utilizing its defense capabilities as a
Japanese national public property for international peace cooperation activities and contributing positively to
the establishment of world peace.
To meet the needs of the times and the expectations of the Japanese people in this context, the Ministry of
Defense needs to ensure that it appropriately transforms its stances and roles through changes in the security
environment. It is especially important today to ensure that defense capabilities function properly when they
are needed.
For this reason, the Ministry of Defense must further strengthen its crisis management system so that it can
deal more quickly and accurately with a variety of emergency situations and ensure the safety and security of
the nation. To respond more suitably to changing circumstances, the Ministry must bolster its policymaking/planning functions and present a variety of policy options; to deal effectively with the policy issues of
a new era, the Ministry must also continually conduct reviews to make sure that its organizations are suited to
the times.
At the same time, some aspects should be maintained without change. The Ministry of Defense is a key
organization responsible for national defense as the state’s most fundamental role, and defense administration
is based on the support and trust of the people. Grounded on the significance of defense, the Ministry of
Defense firmly holds to an exclusively defense-oriented policy and a repudiation of any ambition to become a
major military power as the foundations of defense policy, and must strive to fulfill its duties to satisfy the
public’s trust under a framework of civilian control of the military, characterized by Diet and Cabinet control
over the SDF. In implementing measures, the Ministry of Defense must continue to remain accountable for
both inside and outside Japan so as to earn the understanding and support of the nation.
The transition to the Ministry of Defense, the stipulation of international peace cooperation as a primary
mission, and the reorganization of the Ministry of Defense are all efforts to this end. The Ministry of Defense is
seeking through these measures to become a more robust organization in crises that can also contribute to
world peace.
Section 1 of this chapter will present the history of the Ministry of Defense and the Self Defense Forces,
and will describe the defense posture that has taken on greater importance in national administration by
showing actual examples of the activities of today’s Ministry of Defense and SDF. Section 2 will explain the
transition to ministry status and the stipulation of international peace cooperation as SDF’s primary mission as
measures toward creating a new organization responsible for defense, and Section 3 will discuss the Ministry
of Defense’s organization.

Section 1. History of the MOD/SDF
—Expansion of the Duties/Roles Required of the MOD/SDF—

The Defense Agency and the SDF were established in 1954, and in their 52nd year were transitioned to the
MOD. With the turning point marked by the end of the Cold War spurring significant changes to the security
environment, the duties and roles required for the MOD/SDF have expanded to include responding to largescale natural disasters inside and outside the country and participating in international peace cooperation
activities. The importance of defense has increased, and the nation’s expectations of the MOD/SDF are rising.
These changes make it imperative that the MOD enhance its policy-making/planning functions and carry out
more effective defense administration.
This section will outline the MOD/SDF’s history and offer actual examples of the activities of today’s
MOD/SDF.

**1. The History of the MOD/SDF**

**1. From the Establishment of the Defense Agency/SDF to the End of the Cold War**
In August 1945, Japan accepted the terms of the Potsdam Declaration and agreed to implement its conditions.
Under Allied occupation, Japan dismantled its former army and navy and continued its efforts to rebuild the
country and restore its sovereignty. Against the backdrop of an East-West Cold War emerging between the
United States and the USSR (and their respective allies), the partition of the Korean Peninsula and the
conclusion of a treaty of friendship, alliance and mutual assistance between China and the Soviet Union, the
Korean War erupted in 1950. With the mainstay of U.S. forces in Japan expected to be deployed to the Korean
Peninsula as part of a U.N. force, the Japanese government established the National Police Reserve in August
1950 to maintain domestic order.
In 1951 the San Francisco Peace Treaty with Japan and the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty were signed, and
April 28, 1952 saw the restoration of Japan’s sovereignty and its return to the international community as an
independent state. The Japan-U.S. Security Treaty nevertheless permitted U.S. military forces to be stationed in
Japan for national defense purposes, with Japan to rely on the U.S. military for defense against direct invasion.
In August 1952, three months after the restoration of sovereignty, the National Police Reserve and the
Maritime Guard (created as an organization of the Japan Coast Guard in April of that year) were combined to
form a National Safety Agency whose purpose was similar to that of the National Police Reserve, i.e., to
supplement general police capabilities for maintaining domestic order. However, Japan did not go so far as to
establish an organization responsible for national defense.
In May 1953, it became clear that the United States was considering economic and military aid to Japan
based on the Mutual Security Act (MSA). Although the Japanese government chose to accept this MSA, it
conditioned its approval of the MSA agreement on efforts by Japan for its own defense; increases to the
National Safety Force thus became a focus of Japan-U.S. negotiations. Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida
(President of the Liberal Party) and Mamoru Shigemitsu, President of the Reform Party (then an opposition
party), met for talks on this issue in September 1953, and came to agreement on developing a long-term
program to establish defense capabilities, revising the National Safety Agency Law, transforming the National
Safety Force into the Self-Defense Force, and assigning to the SDF the mission of defending Japan against
direct invasion.
Following this political decision, the Japanese government dispatched a special envoy (Hayato Ikeda,
Chairman of the Liberal Party’s Policy Research Committee) to the United States, where he engaged in
discussions with Assistant Secretary of State Robertson (Ikeda-Robertson Talks). The negotiations on Japan’s

defense capabilities faced problems (Japan insisted on a force of 180,000 personnel, the United States on a
325,000-strong force), but the U.S. side also acknowledged the restrictions faced by Japan in increasing its
defense capabilities. The MSA Agreement was finally signed in March 1954.
The Yoshida-Shigemitsu talks prompted three conservative parties (Liberal Party, Progressive Party, Japan
Liberal Party) to meet for a series of negotiations. In March 1954 two defense bills—the Defense Agency
Establishment Bill and the Self Defense Forces Law—were approved by the Cabinet, passed by the Diet on
June 2, and went into force in July 1 of that year. Thus was born the first organization in the post-war period
that had as its mission the defense of Japan against an armed attack.
As a consequence of this establishment process, the Defense Agency was initially a small organization,
provided or loaned almost all of its equipment by the United States. Its primary mission was to build up from
scratch and maintain the country’s defense capabilities and to manage defense personnel.
The very existence of the SDF was of significance in the sense of serving as a deterrent against the
contingency of an invasion during the Cold War. Until the Cold War drew to a close, the Defense Agency
focused more attention on building the SDF as a deterrent than on actually deploying the SDF.
Although the constitutionality of the SDF was still the object of debate between the ruling and opposition
parties in the Diet, SDF members enthusiastically embraced their mission and conscientiously continued

performing their duties. The insights and dedication of numerous SDF members from the SDF’s establishment
through the end of the Cold War enabled the Defense Agency/SDF to overcome the challenges of a complex
environment and conditions and to deepen the understanding and support of the nation.
Through such efforts, the Defense Agency and the SDF steadily continued to develop fundamental defense
capabilities but Japan never faced a security crisis requiring deployment of the SDF under the Japan-U.S.
security arrangements.

**2. The Post-Cold War Era**
The end of the Cold War greatly altered the security environment, giving rise to the need to utilize a diversity
of defensive capabilities in a variety of situations. The role of the SDF has accordingly shifted in emphasis
from “an SDF presence” focused on deterrence to “a more functional SDF” stressing adaptability.
The MOD has sought to establish “a more functional SDF” by transforming it into a more policy-oriented
organization that studies defense policy, creates legislative bills, and takes action. More specifically, the
following missions and roles are expanding and its role as a policy organ has grown. (See Fig. II-3-1-1)

Paralleling this, the point in the operation of MOD is shifting from management to policymaking/planning, and the MOD now needs to bolster its defense policy-making/planning functions so that it
can smoothly and appropriately utilize defense capabilities.

**(1) Expansion of the Missions and Roles of the MOD/SDF**
The drafts and plans of important policies drawn up by the MOD have increased sharply in the new security
environment. Between the conclusion of the Cold War and the end of last year, more than 60 key defenserelated measures were taken by the Japanese government: 41 laws (including emergency legislation) were
passed or revised, a total of 12 treaties and joint statements were concluded and made with foreign
governments, and nine Cabinet decisions were issued. (See Fig. II-3-1-2)

**(2) Increase in Activities Inside and Outside Japan**
**a. Activities within Japan**
The SDF has responded to a variety of disasters—the Great Hanshin-Awaji Earthquake, the eruption of Mt.
Unzen-Fugen, the subway sarin incident, the eruption of Mt. Usu, the Niigata Prefecture Chuetsu Earthquake,
and torrential rainfall—and to the appearance of suspicious vessels in Japanese waters. From the Great
Hanshin-Awaji Earthquake to the end of last year, domestic disaster response activities—including dispatches
to areas stricken by the October 2004 Niigata Prefecture Chuetsu Earthquake and the March 2007 Noto
Peninsula Earthquake—numbered about 10,000 and involved a total of about 2.75 million SDF members.
The appearance of a suspicious vessel off the coast of the Noto Peninsula in 1999 prompted the Japanese
government to order the first maritime security operations since the SDF was established. The second maritime
security operations were carried out in 2004 when a Chinese nuclear-powered submarine made a submerged
passage through Japanese waters.
In the wake of the 1998 launch of a ballistic missile by North Korea, the government began developing a
ballistic missile defense system to counter the emerging threat of ballistic missiles.

**b. Activities Overseas**
Partial revisions to the International Peace Cooperation Law and the Law Concerning the Dispatch of
International Disaster Relief Teams were passed in 1992 and, since the dispatch of SDF units to Cambodia, the
SDF has been engaged in international peace cooperation activities around the world in such places as
Mozambique, Zaire, the Golan Heights, and East Timor. The SDF’s international peace cooperation activities
have particularly expanded in recent years – among these being international disaster relief activities, Iraq
humanitarian and recovery assistance activities in line with the Law Concerning Special Measures on
Humanitarian and Reconstruction Assistance in Iraq, and activities in the Indian Ocean based on the AntiTerrorism Special Measures Law as well as peacekeeping operations – and a total of about 30,000 SDF
members have been dispatched in 20 or so deployments as of the end of last year. (See Fig. II-3-1-3)

**c. Japan-U.S. Defense Cooperation**
Defense cooperation between Japan and the United States has become more effective and the Japan-U.S.
security arrangements more reliable with the formulation of the 1996 Japan-U.S. Joint Declaration on Security
and the 1997 Guidelines for Japan-U.S. Defense Cooperation. Japan-U.S. cooperation has also progressed
internationally in the fight against terrorism since the terrorist attacks in the United States on September 11,
2001. In addition, defense cooperation between Japan and the United States has been strengthened and
expanded through Japan-U.S. talks on the realignment of U.S. forces. (See Part III, Chapter 2)

**d. Security Dialogue and Defense Exchange**
In recognition of the importance to the security environment of deepening relations of mutual trust, bilateral
and multilateral security dialogue and defense exchange have been actively conducted in recent years, with 18
countries/organizations in Asia engaged in regular discussions. (See Part III, Chapter 3, Section 2)

**(3) Expansion of Support and Understanding of MOD/SDF Activities**
The efforts of countless SDF members have garnered public understanding and support for the MOD/SDF, and
the MOD/SDF are viewed both in Japan and overseas in a considerably different light now than when they
were created 52 years ago. A public opinion poll conducted by the Cabinet Office last year showed that about
85% of the Japanese public had a favorable impression of the SDF. The overseas activities of the SDF have
also earned the praise and heightened the expectations of the international community. (See Figs. II-3-1-4 • 5)
(See Reference 61)

**2. MOD/SDF Activities Today**
Today’s changing security environment necessitates
discussions with other countries, relevant
ministries/agencies and local governments as well as
expansion of the missions and roles of the MOD/SDF
in dealing with terrorism and suspicious vessels,
countering ballistic missiles, supporting U.S. military
realignment, engaging in international peace
cooperation activities, and providing public
protection and disaster prevention.
Specifically, the MOD/SDF is increasingly
involved in 1) discussions with the United States and

SDF troops in Samawah camp bid farewell to departing units

other countries, 2) negotiations with relevant
ministries/agencies on the SDF’s international peace cooperation activities, community development for local
governments hosting bases, transfer costs for U.S. military facilities, and such matters, and 3) discussions and
collaboration with local governments in public protection, disaster prevention drills, and military base issues.
These discussions and negotiations are directly tied to the defense of Japan and the safety of the Japanese
people.
Even as the MOD concerns itself with policy-making/planning, overseeing the SDF, and conducting
discussions with other countries, relevant ministries/agencies and local governments, it is transforming into an
organization providing various forms of assistance to SDF members carrying out their missions heedless of
danger and to their families back at home.
In these circumstances, the MOD has responsibility and authority for the nation’s defense under the control
of the Minister of Defense, whose exclusive responsibility is the defense of the country. Accordingly the MOD
needs to engage in defense-related discussions with other countries, relevant ministries/agencies and local
governments and take other steps beneficial to the peace, safety, and future of Japan.
This section will cite specific examples of the current activities of the MOD/SDF – such as efforts to
address Iraq humanitarian and reconstruction assistance, ballistic missile defense, and issues surrounding U.S.
military facilities/areas in Japan – to provide a sample of MOD/SDF activities.

**1. Iraq Humanitarian and Reconstruction Assistance Activities**
The international community has worked in concert to assist in the recovery and reconstruction of Iraq by the
Iraqi people themselves. To build a peaceful and stable society in Iraq for the future, serious efforts by both the
Iraqi people and the entire international community are needed, and numerous approaches by Japan and the rest
of the international community are necessary. Japan, as a responsible member of the international community
and in consideration of its own national interest, has been involved for about three and a half years in activities
for the reconstruction of Iraq.
The government began in early 2004 dispatching GSDF units assigned humanitarian and reconstruction
assistance duties in accordance with the Law Concerning Special Measures on Humanitarian and
Reconstruction Assistance in Iraq, and later withdrew these units after determining that they had accomplished
their objective of laying the minimum groundwork necessary for Iraqis in Musanna Province themselves to
carry on the reconstruction. In response to a request from the United Nations, ASDF units continue to provide
assistance to the United Nations and the multinational forces by, for instance, airlift operations Baghdad and
Irbil.


-----

The MOD/SDF have implemented a wide range of efforts and measures to effectively carry out the SDF’s
Iraq humanitarian and reconstruction assistance activities, and the following are seen as the key factors for
GSDF’s successful mission in Iraq

**a. Selection of Dispatch Destinations**
Following passage of the Law Concerning Special Measures on Humanitarian and Reconstruction Assistance
in Iraq in the Diet, a government survey team and a specialist research team principally comprised of SDF
officials were dispatched to study detailed local requirements for SDF activities.
The survey results provided by the specialist research team mostly made up of SDF officials made it clear
that in southeastern Iraq 1) the locals had high hopes that medical equipment would be provided and hospital
facilities repaired, 2) restoring elementary schools (e.g., improving school grounds and painting school
buildings) would be an effective means of building good relations with the local residents, and 3) the supply of
water for day-to-day use in Musanna Province was both qualitatively and quantitatively inadequate due to poor
water infrastructure. Also, the same team confirmed that the security environment was relatively stable in the
area.

As a result of the research and the comprehensive analysis of relevant information, it became clear that
Japan was expected to provide reconstruction assistance in Iraq and that there were certain activities that the
SDF could perform safely. Hence the Japanese government determined that Japan, as a responsible member of
the international community, should engage in the activities and dispatched the SDF units to Iraq.

**b. Connection with Official Development Assistance (ODA)**
The GSDF’s activities in Iraq in conjunction with ODA assistance under the purview of the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs contributed to the reconstruction of Iraq just like a car is smoothly driven by its four wheels.
The concerted functioning of ODA and the SDF’s humanitarian cooperation in medical assistance activities—
for example, the use of medical equipment provided through ODA and guidance in medical technology offered
by the SDF—made possible seamless assistance in both the “hardware” and “software” aspects of enhancing
Samawa’s medical system, and produced major accomplishments. In addition, Japan was also able to generate
visible successes in Iraq reconstruction assistance by improving/restoring water supply and public facilities as a
result of cooperation between the SDF and ODA by effectively carrying out reconstruction assistance
activities.


-----

**c. Measures to Deal with Harsh Environments**
The SDF conducted its activities in Iraq under a harsh and trying environment, so the former Defense Agency
from the outset placed great emphasis on ensuring that dispatched SDF members would be able to maintain
good physical and mental health and execute their duties without problem. Welfare facilities outfitted with
training gyms and rooms for contacting family members were set up in the camps of dispatched units so that
SDF members could maintain high morale and concentrate with peace of mind on their duties even in such
difficult working conditions.
Together with securing communications channels
(international telephone, video-phone, and e-mail)
that permit dispatched members and their families to
converse directly, the MOD also endeavored to
sustain the bonds between SDF members and their
family members back home by organizing video
letters between SDF members and their families in
Japan so they could keep each other up-to-date on
their situations. The MOD also opened a family
support center and provided assistance to families
back at home so that they could concentrate on their
duties without anxiety.

Families speaking by videophone with SDF member

As mentioned previously, the MOD also implemented mental health care measures, offering courses that
provided SDF members the knowledge necessary to reduce stress prior to dispatch and training certain SDF
members to serve as counselors at the camps; these steps all point to the consideration given by the MOD to the
psychological care of SDF members engaged in professional duties under harsh conditions. In addition, the
MOD assigned medical officers to the dispatched units, sent medical officers with specialist knowledge from
Japan if necessary, and provided repatriation treatment.

**d. Exchange with Local Residents**
Good relations with local residents were essential to the dispatched GSDF units in carrying out their activities.
With this in mind, SDF members taught origami to the local people, presented musical concerts, and otherwise
made efforts to engage in exchange with the local people while providing humanitarian and reconstruction
assistance. The local children responded warmly, staging theatrical performances and making paintings for the
SDF members.
Positive ties were established with the local residents through these exchanges and, on February 26, 2005,
about 150 people joined together in a show of support for the GSDF troops held in front of the GSDF camp;
such an expression of support was unprecedented among the multinational coalition. During their activities and
during transit, members of the GSDF units were regularly greeted with smiles and waves by the local residents.

**e. Friendly Relations with the Defense Organizations of Other Countries**
Even before the GSDF units arrived, the Dutch military was in charge of maintaining public order in Musanna
Province. The Dutch military assisted the GSDF in numerous ways by aiding the surveys conducted prior to the
dispatch of GSDF units, supporting the deployment of these units, and helping the GSDF units once their
activities were underway. The Dutch military began its withdrawal in February 2005, handing over
responsibility for maintaining security in Musanna Province to the British military on March 7, 2005; in May
the Australian military was dispatched to Samawa, and British and Australian units were deployed in the area


-----

from May until the pullout of the GSDF units. Although Samawa could be said to be more secure than other
regions, the hazard of possible terrorist activity made collaboration with the multinational forces critical for the
GSDF units. Consequently, the GSDF units cooperated closely with other forces, assigning liaison personnel
mutually and seeking regular opportunities to share views, cultural exchange, and other interaction. Security
intelligence obtained through close exchanges of views with British and Australian units proved useful to the
protection of SDF in force.
The MOD/SDF have thus accumulated experience by formulating and planning measures to address a
range of issues that enabled the SDF to carry out their humanitarian and reconstruction assistance activities
effectively. The establishment of a basis for the SDF to play leading and active roles in future international
peace cooperation activities via this experience can be deemed a major achievement for the MOD/SDF. (See
Part III, Chapter 3, Section 1)

**2. Ballistic Missile Defense**

**(1) Introduction**
Although Japan decided to introduce a ballistic missile defense system in December 2003, serious discussions
took place within the government before the system was actually introduced.
The MOD’s analysis of the new security environment determined that ballistic missiles capable of carrying
weapons of mass destruction constituted a practical threat for Japan.
Nevertheless, ballistic missile defense is said to be several orders more difficult than hitting a bullet with a
bullet, requiring extremely advanced radar technology and intercept missile guidance technology. The United
States also found the development of a ballistic missile defense system a task fraught with difficulties. After
spending more than 20 years from the Reagan administration and as much as 10 trillion yen to realize ballistic
missile defense, the United States at last obtained the capability of intercepting ballistic missiles and was able
to deploy SM-3 Aegis-borne interceptor missiles and the Patriot PAC-3, a ground-based interception system.
Given these issues, the MOD and other organizations in Japan carried out in-depth studies on whether
Japan should introduce a ballistic missile defense system.
There also remained a variety of unresolved issues between Japan and the United States: whether the
ballistic missile defense capabilities could even be deployed in Japan given the limitations of U.S. production
capabilities, and what approaches should be taken between Japan and the United States toward sharing
intelligence, as well as what joint operational initiatives should be adopted by Japan and the United States.
The conclusions reached in discussions between Japan and the United States, including those between the
MOD and the U.S. Department of Defense were that the United States would deploy the ballistic missile


-----

defense capabilities in Japan, that information would be shared as much as possible, and that Japan would
consider establishing its own ballistic missile defense system while also pursuing joint Japan-U.S. BMD to
double ensure the safety of Japan.
The internal government discussions lasted about six months, and the government approved BMD
introduction at the end of 2003.

**(2) Moving up the Deployment Program**
The MOD has heretofore made a number of studies regarding early deployment of a ballistic missile defense
system to ensure the safety and security of the Japanese people from the threat of ballistic missiles. In light of
recent circumstances such as North Korea’s ballistic missile launches in July 2006, further investigations show
that the 16 Patriot PAC-3 air defense units scheduled to be fully operational at the end of March 2011 could in
fact be ready by mid-2010.

Patriot PAC-3 missile launch SM-3 launch (US DOD)

Refitting of the first SM-3-equipped Aegis vessels for BMD purposes (Kongo) was to be completed around
March 2008, but coordination with the United States has enabled this target date to be moved up to December
2007. Further discussions are being held with the United States on the deployment of other SM-3-equipped
Aegis vessels in the hope of working out a concrete deployment schedule. The MOD will continue to examine
the feasibility of early deployment of BMD systems.

**(3) Deployment of U.S. Army PAC-3 and Related Systems**
The prompt deployment to Japan of U.S. military units having some ability to counter ballistic missiles would
be an effective defensive measure for Japan. To ensure the safety of the public from ballistic missile attacks,
Japan has for some time committedly pursued ballistic missile defense cooperation with the United States. As a
result, a U.S. military mobile BMD radar (AN/TPY-2, i.e., “X-Band Radar”) was deployed in June 2006 to the
ASDF Shariki Sub-base in Aomori Prefecture, the BMD-capable Aegis vessel “Shiloh” entered Yokosuka Port
at the end of August, and U.S. PAC-3 systems were deployed to Kadena Air Base in Okinawa and other sites
beginning that September.
Japan will continue to devote its full efforts to acquiring, as early as possible, the capabilities to protect
itself against ballistic missiles and will maintain its close cooperation with the United States.


-----

**3. Issues Involving U.S. Military Facilities/Areas in Japan**
Tricky negotiations between Japan and the United States over a three-and-a-half-year period reached a final
conclusion on May 1, 2006, on the realignment of U.S. forces in Japan in the form of the “United States-Japan
Roadmap for Realignment Implementation.” In view of the recent changes in the security environment and the
evolution of defense/security policies in both countries, this extremely important step in improving the
effectiveness of Japan-U.S. security arrangements by maintaining deterrence capabilities and reducing the
burdens on local communities is of great significance.
The facilities and areas of U.S. Forces in Japan (USFJ) will play a vital role in the prompt implementation
of a joint Japan-U.S. response to an armed attack on Japan. USFJ also functions as a deterrent to prevent armed
attacks against Japan, and thus have an extremely important responsibility in ensuring Japan’s safety. This U.S.
military presence serves as the foundation for U.S. military engagement in the region, and is essential to
maintaining regional peace and stability.
In order for the USFJ facilities and areas to fulfill their functions adequately, the understanding and
cooperation of the local communities in which they are located are essential. At the same time, progressing
urbanization over the past several decades since the conclusion of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty have brought
USFJ facilities and areas adjacent to urban areas and industrial zones, and in a number of cases they have come
to have a major impact on the living environment of residents and community development. The social
environment of surrounding areas has thus greatly changed. The impact of these facilities and areas must be
reduced as much as possible, taking into account changes in the social environment of surrounding areas, if
USFJ facilities and areas are to fulfill their functions adequately and gain genuine public acceptance and
support. Accordingly, in the realignment of the USFJ, the Japanese government has been implementing
measures to reduce the burdens imposed on local communities surrounding the USFJ facilities and areas,
thereby ensuring the stable use of these facilities and areas.
In order to maintain deterrence and capabilities while reducing burdens on local communities where the
USFJ facilities and areas are located, there must be someone who will share the burdens with the communities,
and so the government has been examining regional promotion and other measures for the municipalities that
will newly assume the burdens following the realignment of the USFJ.
For the realignment of the USFJ, it is basically necessary for the national government to formulate coherent
policies by consulting with the United States, coordinating opinions within the government, and discussing
with local governments.
The internal bureaus of the Ministry of Defense played a central role in discussions with the United States
while the Defense Facilities Administration Agency primarily coordinated with local public authorities, but the
Defense Facilities Administration Agency will be abolished and consolidated into the Ministry of Defense this
fiscal year to create a system whereby talks with the United States, relevant ministries/agencies and local
governments as well as policy proposals can be carried out more efficiently, smoothly, and effectively.
Given its responsibility and authority for defense matters, the MOD will need to actively address issues
involving U.S. military facilities/areas in Japan in the future to earn the trust of the public and local residents.

Section 2. Transition to a Ministry and Stipulation of the International Peace
Cooperation as SDF’s Primary Mission

A bill on the transition of the Defense Agency to a
ministry was submitted to the Diet last year, and
passed by more than 90% of votes in favor in both
the House of Representatives and the House of
Councilors. The Defense Agency thus became the
MOD on January 9, 2007.
The MOD/SDF is an organization that bears the
role of securing the peace and independence of
Japan, the most fundamental role to the nation’s
existence. With the importance of defense increasing
and the public’s expectations of the MOD and SDF

Former Prime Minister Nakasone giving a speech at the ceremony for

on the rise, how to address security issues and crisis commemoration of the transition to a ministry
management has become a key issue of national
administration.
The two major steps of making the transition to the MOD and stipulation of international peace cooperation
activities as the primary mission of the SDF were carried out in order to more precisely address these issues.
This section discusses these steps.

**1. Basic Concepts in Transition to a Ministry and Stipulation of the International Peace**
**Cooperation as SDF’s Primary Mission**

**1. Background**
The background of the transition of the Defense Agency to a ministry is changes in the security environment
surrounding Japan. The principal changes are described below.

**(1) Japan’s Response to Emergency Situations**
In areas surrounding Japan, there exist concerns over proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and ballistic
missiles and over issues of territorial rights, while inside Japan, large-scale natural disasters occur almost every
year. Today we live in a world where rapid and proper management of such diverse risks is needed in order to
protect the lives and property of the people.

**(2) Changes in the International Environment**
Responses to new threats and diverse contingencies that have emerged since the end of the Cold War, such as
international terrorism and increasing proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, have become issues in
today’s world. In addition, with interdependence among countries deepening, the peace and security of one
country has become closely related to the peace and security of the international community as a whole.
Therefore, active efforts to improve the international security environment on Japan’s own initiative
become an important issue from the viewpoint of the peace and security of Japan.

**(3) Changes in the Roles of Defense Forces in the International Community**
Given the present international and domestic circumstances, the roles of defense forces are expanding beyond
preventive measures and responses to full-scale invasions against Japan, to a wide range of endeavors,


-----

including responses to diverse contingencies such as terrorism, the United Nations and other peace keeping
operations, support for nation-building, disaster relief dispatches both at home and abroad, and improvements
to Japan’s credibility in the security aspect of its relations with other countries.

**2. Necessity of Transition to a Ministry and Stipulation of International Peace Cooperation as**
**SDF’s Primary Mission**

As mentioned above, in the changing security environment surrounding Japan, the SDF has been accumulating
experience in various operations, including U.N. Peace Keeping Operations, international disaster relief
operations, and disaster dispatches, for over 50 years since its establishment, and such operations are gaining
wider public acceptance. Furthermore, there are increasing expectations and requests from the international
community for the SDF’s performance as apparent from the praise given the SDF’s performance thus far, and
these expectations must be fulfilled.
In these situations, it is important 1) to improve defense policy-making/planning functions, 2) to enhance
and strengthen responses to emergency situations; and 3) to develop a structure that allows for proactive efforts
for the peace and stability of the international community.
In developing such a structure, it was necessary to give the Defense Agency the status of a ministry within
the organization of the Government of Japan and to place a minister exclusively in charge of national defense
so that it can appropriately fulfill the significant roles discussed above. In addition, it was necessary to review
the primary mission of the SDF, and to such activities as international peace cooperation.

**2. Significance of Transition to a Ministry**

**1. Significance of Transition to a Ministry**
The Cabinet is responsible for the Government, and each of the 11 office and ministries has its own exclusive
chief, or a minister in charge. For instance, the Finance Minister exclusively in charge of financial affairs, and
the Foreign Minister in charge of foreign affairs. On the other hand, the Prime Minister, as the head of the
Cabinet Office, who is responsible for administrative affairs such as gender equality, the Northern Territories
issue and finance, also served as the minister in charge of national defense.
In Japan, organizations responsible for important policies are given ministry status, while the Defense
Agency had remained an agency.
The Defense Agency/SDF had assumed a fundamental role for a state, which is to safeguard the peace and
independence of Japan. On top of that, in order to fulfill the responsibilities now required of the Defense
Agency/SDF, to be touched upon later in this section, it was necessary to add activities such as international
peace cooperation operations to the primary missions of the SDF.
In light of these circumstances, the transition to a ministry entailed putting in place a minister in charge to
serve as a chief of national defense, the importance of which has increased in governmental affairs. The
transition to a ministry also gives the Defense Agency the same status of a ministry as other organizations
responsible for important policies. Because the minister responsible for national defense following this
transition will be the Minister of Defense, supervision and control responsibilities as the minister in charge of
defense will fall not to the Prime Minister as head of the Cabinet Office but to the Minister of Defense. (See
Fig. II-3-2-1)
As mentioned earlier, the transition to the MOD was designed 1) to bolster defense policy-making/planning
functions, 2) to enhance and strengthen responses to emergency situations, and 3) to enable Japan on its own
initiative to work proactively for the peace and stability of the international community.

The transition to the MOD will also likely have a positive impact on the morale among SDF members and

**Fig. II-3-2-1 Central Government Structure**

Cabinet
(Prime Minister)

public opinion as well.
Below are presented more specific explications on the significance of the aforementioned.

**(1) Bolstering the Defense Policy Making/Planning System**
The primary reason for the designation of the MOD as the Defense Agency hitherto has been that management
of the SDF was considered its primary mission.
The Defense Agency’s primary role was rather management of the SDF, i.e., the enhancement of defense
capabilities and the administration of personnel affairs, than policy-making/planning.
With the changes in the security environment surrounding Japan in recent years, the SDF’s mission has
expanded and diversified from the defense of Japan to incorporate disaster relief activities both at home and
abroad and activities for international peace with the fact that its actual number of operations have increased.
The Defense Agency had already been transformed into an organization qualified for ministry status such
as policy-making/planning and control of the SDF by the important defense-related bills passed by the Diet
almost every year in recent years.
The operational priorities of the Defense Agency have thus shifted from management of the SDF to policy
making/planning and, in line with this change, circumstances emerged that were favorable to its repositioning
as a ministry and an organization primarily responsible for policy-making/planning functions.
This transition to a ministry created a minister with exclusive responsibility for national defense and, the
Minister of Defense has been granted responsibility and authority appropriate to a policy organ that enables the
MOD to respond to changing circumstances and present a variety of policy options, including the drafting of
bills and deployment of the SDF. This bolstered its policy-making/planning functions and implementation
capabilities.

**(2) Rapid and Appropriate Responses to Diverse Emergency Situations**
In the midst of the changing security environment, it is necessary to ensure people’s safety and provide
reassurances against diverse emergency situations, including terrorism, suspicious boat incidents, and natural
disasters. In meeting the important responsibility of responding to emergency situations, the MOD/SDF needs
to devise a framework for rapid and accurate responses to all contingencies through coordination with relevant


-----

governmental organizations as well as local governments and utilization of the personnel, organization and
equipment of the SDF.
While the Defense Agency was still an external-ministerial bureau of the Cabinet Office, the Director
General of the Defense Agency was unable to request Cabinet meetings for the establishment of laws and
regulations relevant to the work of the Agency and for the conduct of important SDF activities, which were
instead proposed by the head of the Cabinet Office, i.e., the Prime Minister. The Director-General of the
Defense Agency was also unable to directly submit budget and disbursement requests to the Minister of
Finance.
Transition to a ministry will provide a more reliable emergency-management system as described below.

**a. The Minister of State for Defense will be called the Minister of Defense as the minister exclusively**
responsible for national defense just like ministers in charge of other ministries. This will clarify the line of
responsibility for national defense.

**b. The efforts in undertaking national crisis management will demonstrate clearly to its nationals and other**
countries.

**c. The head of the ministry, not the prime minister, will, as the minister in charge, be able to directly exercise**
his or her duties, which will further enhance and strengthen the crisis management and enable more rapid
and precise response to a variety of emergency situations.
1) Requests to the Prime Minister to call Cabinet meetings for enactment and an amendment of laws and
ministry ordinances concerning security and the SDF
2) Requests to the Finance Minister regarding budget requests and implementation; acquisition of government
properties such as training areas
3) Requests to the Prime Minister to call Cabinet meetings to make decisions on implementation of important
activities to protect the lives and property of the public, such as maritime security operations

The authority of the Prime Minister as the head of the Cabinet, such as the authority of supreme
commander of the SDF and the authority to order the SDF to possess defense operations and public security
operations, which are traditionally held by the Prime Minister as the chief of the Cabinet Office, shall continue
to be preserved by the Prime Minister without change.
4) Requests to the Prime Minister to call Cabinet meetings for approving personnel appointments to major
positions at the Ministry of Defense/SDF. (See Fig. II-3-2-2)

**Q&A**

**Will the transition of the Japan Defense Agency to a ministry facilitate the Self-Defense**
**Forces to respond quickly to diverse emergency situations?**

The security environment surrounding Japan is dramatically changing due to the proliferation of weapons
of mass destruction and ballistic missiles as well as to the intensification of international terrorism. When
the Self-Defense Forces takes necessary action, such as defense operations, against those new threats and
diverse contingencies, they can do so only after the order is given by the Prime Minister upon approval of
the Cabinet or after the order of the Minister of State for Defense (currently Minister of Defense) is
approved by the Prime Minister.
Under this system, since the Minister of State for Defense was not a “competent minister” (although
the Minister of State for Defense was in effect in charge of administrative affairs concerning defense), he
had no right to call for a Cabinet meeting by himself, and had to request the Prime Minister, who is the
competent minister for the Cabinet Office, to call for a Cabinet meeting.
The transition of the Japan Defense Agency to a ministry is believed to accelerate response of SDF by
shortening the time it takes for the government to make necessary decisions in the face of a serous crisis.
By enabling the Minister of Defense to directly call for a Cabinet meeting, the new system is expected to
make operations of SDF more timely and appropriate.

**(3) Development of a Structure to Engage in Proactive Efforts toward the Peace and Stability**
**of the International Community on Japan’s Own Initiative**

In order to engage in proactive efforts to improve the international security environment by Japan’s own
initiative, the SDF needs more than ever to take advantage of the capabilities it possesses. To that end, it is
critical that the Defense Agency be transformed into an organization that gives greater importance to
international peace keeping operations via the SDF as well as security dialogues and defense exchanges.
Transition of the Defense Agency to a ministry, together with stipulation of international peace cooperation
as the SDF’s primary mission, which will be mentioned later, will clarify both at home and abroad Japan’s
posture on national defense and the realization of peace in the international community.
Furthermore, as seen in the recent transformation of U.S. forces in Japan and elsewhere, the importance of
policy consultations on security and defense affairs the United States as Japan’s ally has been increasing. In
addition, security talks with other countries have frequently been held to promote confidence-building and
cooperation in international peace cooperation.
Government organizations in charge of national defense around the world are designated either a
“Ministry” or a “Department,” and only Japan had given responsibility for national defense to an “Agency.”
Both in the United States and the United Kingdom, “Agency” refers to an organization that implements
specific given tasks sitting below a “Ministry” or “Department,” which is responsible for policymaking/planning.
This “agency” status potentially invited misunderstandings by other parties during defense talks,
international dialogue and the SDF activities conducted overseas in cooperation with other countries because
the Defense Agency may not have been deemed an administrative organ equivalent to those in charge of
national defense in other countries.
Making the transition to a ministry equivalent to the administrative organizations in other countries
responsible for national defense will correct such misunderstandings in the future. The minister in charge of
national defense will be able to engage in discussions with defense of other countries as an equal governmental
chief both in name and reality, which will deepen confidence-building and cooperative relations further. (See

**Q&A**

**How has the transition to a ministry been accepted by other countries?**

Many countries celebrated the transition and expressed their high expectations for the newly established
Ministry of Defense. Southeast Asian countries including the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore,


-----

Vietnam, Thailand, and Myanmar, Western countries including the United States, Canada, the United
Kingdom, Germany, France, the Netherlands, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Russia, and Ukraine, and many other
countries including Australia, New Zealand, Mongolia, Pakistan, Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, South
Africa and Mauritania announced that they welcome the establishment of the Ministry of Defense.
Philippine President Arroyo, for example, stated at the summit meeting with Prime Minister Abe on
December 9, 2006, that it is important to promote a dialog between the two countries concerning politics
and security, and that she welcomes the transition of the Japan Defense Ministry to the Ministry of
Defense and expects the transition to help to accelerate their cooperation. China and the Republic of
Korea sent comments through their diplomatic authorities that they expect Japan to maintain its pacifism.

The major objective of making the transition from the Japan Defense Agency to a ministry is to
change the positioning of the administrative organization and develop a system in which Japan can
perform crisis management and international peace cooperation activities even more efficiently, and
therefore the transition will not cause the enhancement of Japan’s defense capability in terms of both
quantity and quality or the change in the exclusively defense oriented policy and other basic defense
policies currently maintained by the government. This objective has been explained to other countries
through security dialogs and defense exchanges at all levels including the Minister of Defense (Minister of
State for Defense before the transition).
In addition, administrative organizations responsible for defense in neighboring and other countries
are all positioned as either a ministry or a department.
Furthermore, the defense policies of Japan and activities of the Self-Defense Forces have been
explained in annual “Defense of Japan” whitepapers as well as through security dialogs and defense
exchanges with other countries, and the international understanding toward those Japanese policies and
activities has been deepened.
It is therefore the government’s belief that the transition to a ministry is generally accepted favorably
by the neighboring and other countries as described above.

The Ministry of Defense will continue to explain the objective of the transition to other countries.

**2. Adherence to the Fundamentals of Defense Policies**
The purpose of the transition to the MOD is to
prepare a structure suitable for an organization taking
on the important function of defense policymaking/planning, including responses to emergency
situations and Japanese initiatives for the peace and
stability of the international community, in
accordance with both international and domestic
security environments.
Hence, transition to a ministry has not brought
about any changes in the following fundamental
aspects of Japan’s defense policy—1) an exclusively
defense-oriented policy, 2) a policy of not becoming Former Defense Agency Director-General Kawara giving a speech at the ceremonyfor commemoration of the transition to a ministry
a military power that poses a threat to other
countries, 3) the three non-nuclear principles, 4) civilian control of the military, and 5) building of a modest

description of these principles). (See Fig. II-3-2-4)

**[COLUMN]**

**Q&A**

**Has the transition to a ministry affected civilian control of the Self-Defense Forces**
**in any way?**

When the transition from the Japan Defense Agency to a ministry was made, it was decided to maintain
the basic civilian control framework including the following:

-  The laws concerning and budgets for the Self-Defense Forces are placed under the democratic control of
the Diet.

-  The civilian Prime Minister holds the authority of supreme commander over SDF on behalf of the
Cabinet, and the civilian Minister of State for Defense (Minister of Defense after the transition) controls
SDF operations.

-  The Security Council of Japan is established within the Cabinet to discuss important matters concerning
security.
The civilian control thus continues to be strictly maintained.
In addition, the Act on the Transition to the Ministry of Defense states expressly that international
peace cooperation activities and response to situations in areas surrounding Japan must be consulted with
the Security Council of Japan to enhance civilian control over those matters.
Transferring administrative affairs concerning national defense, which had been handled by the Prime
Minister, the chief of the Cabinet Office, to the exclusive hands of the competent minister, while the
framework of civilian control by the Prime Minister who serves as the head of the Cabinet as well as the
commander in chief is maintained as explained above, is expected to further clarify who is responsible for
and authorized to control the Self-Defense Forces, and thereby lead to even stricter civil control.
Therefore, the transition to the Ministry of Defense is a move to further enhance, and never
compromise, civilian control.


-----

**[COLUMN]**

**Q&A**

**Why was the ministry named “Boei-sho (Ministry of Defense)” rather than**
**“Kokubo-sho (Ministry of National Defense)”?**

The word “Boei (defense)” had been used for Boei-cho (former Japan Defense Agency) for more than 50
years and is already familiar among the Japanese people. Boei is also used as a part of many legal terms,
and established in Japan, where the exclusively defense oriented policy is maintained, as a word to express
“defense” as in Boei Keikaku no Taiko (National Defense Program Outline) and Boei-ryoku Seibi Keikaku
(Defense Build-up Plan).
Although there were some who argued that the name should be “Kokubo-sho” when the bill to make
the transition from the Japan Defense Agency to a ministry was submitted, it was decided that “Boei-sho”
is more appropriate as “Boei” has been used by the public for 50 years and is more natural. The name
“Boei-sho” was also used during the deliberation by the ruling parties, and the bill was approved and
passed in the Diet under the name of “Boei-sho.”

**3. History of the Transition to a Ministry**
The Defense Agency was established as an external ministerial bureau in the Prime Minister’s office in 1954
when the National Safety Agency was abolished. The discussion over transition from an agency to a ministry is
not a new one, but has been repeatedly raised in the political arena since the inception of the Defense Agency.
In 1964, when the First Defense Build-up Program was completed and the framework of Japan’s defense
capability was tentatively developed, a bill for the transition of the Defense Agency to a ministry was once
even approved by the Cabinet, though the bill stopped short of being submitted to the Diet[1].
In 1981 the issue was taken up again at the Second Ad Hoc Commission on the Public Administrative
Reform which was held to review government organization as a whole.
In 1997, the issue of transition to a ministry was raised at the Administrative Reform Conference. Though
its final report recommended that the current Defense Agency be continued, it also stated that the fundamental
issues of Japan’s national defense under new international circumstances should be separately discussed in the
political arena. Political discussions continued for the next eight years. During that period, the Legislative Bill
concerning the draft Defense Ministry Establishment Law was submitted to the Diet as lawmaker-initiated
legislation in 2001, and in December 2002, a consensus was reached among three ruling parties—the Liberal
Democratic Party (LDP), the Komei Party and the New Conservative Party—to put the issue of transition of
the Defense Agency to a ministry before everything on the agenda once the emergency legislation was enacted.
However, in October 2003, the said legislative bill was abandoned with the dissolution of the House of
Representatives.
Reforms have been subsequently carried out to create an organization worthy of ministry status. For
instance, emergency legislation was enacted in 2003 and 2004, and with the establishment of the Joint Staff
Office, joint operations functions were enhanced in March 2006. The July 2006 large-scale overhaul of the
Internal Bureaus of the Defense Agency also strengthened its policy-making/planning functions. The bidrigging scandal at the Defense Facilities Administration Agency that came to light in January 2006 was
regarded as one of the incidents that severely damaged public confidence. Efforts were made to take preventive
measures against the recurrence of such incidents and to restore public trust. On the basis of such
circumstances, discussions over the issue of transition to a ministry have continued in the political arena. (See
Part III, Chapter 4, Section 3)


-----

Specifically, the administrative reform promotion headquarters of the LDP (Chief of headquarters: Mr.
Seishiro Eto) on November 22, 2005, endorsed the submission of a bill concerning transition to a ministry to
the Diet with the aim of enactment, triggering a debate on this matter within the ruling parties.
Since then, members of the ruling parties have been engaged in lively discussions in the relevant
committees of the LDP and the Komei Party, with the security project team of the ruling parties (Chairman:
Mr. Taku Yamasaki) at the core.
In the course of such discussions, the following directions emerged: 1) a related bill was to be submitted by
the Cabinet, 2) incorporating in the bill the stipulation of activities such as international peace cooperation as a
primary mission of the SDF, 3) incorporating in the bill explicit provisions that important matters concerning
activities like international peace cooperation should be items on which the Prime Minister seeks advice of the
Security Council, 4) calling the new ministry “the Ministry of Defense,” and 5) incorporating in the bills the
implementation of such measures as the abolishment and merger of the Defense Facilities Administration
Agency in FY 2007.
After such discussions in the political arena, both of the ruling parties approved in June 2006 the
submission of the relevant bill to the Diet by the Cabinet (on June 6 to 8), the “Bill concerning Partial
Amendment of the Defense Agency Establishment Law and Other Laws” was approved by the Cabinet, and the
bill was introduced to last year’s ordinary Diet session (on June 9). At the conclusion of the ordinary Diet
session, however, this bill was selected for continued deliberation.
In the autumn 2006 extraordinary Diet session, a briefing on the bill and a question-and-answer session
were held on October 27 in the House of Representatives plenary session, after which the bill was submitted to
the House of Representatives’ Security Committee for deliberation. The bill was approved by the Committee
on November 30, then passed that same day by the House of Representatives in its plenary session with more
than 90% of votes in favor.
A briefing on the bill and a question-and-answer session were subsequently held on December 6 in the
House of Councilors plenary session, after which the bill was sent to the House of Councilors’ Foreign Affairs
and Defense Committee for further deliberation. The bill was approved by the Committee on December 14,
then passed the following day with the original language of the bill by the House of Councilors in its plenary
session with more than 90% of the votes in favor. The law was promulgated on December 22, 2006, and went
into effect from January 9, 2007.

**3. Significance of Stipulation of International Peace Cooperation as SDF’s Primary**
**Mission**

**1. Traditional Concepts**
The first priority mission of the SDF is defense of the country against direct and indirect invasions. In addition,
the SDF shall be engaged in missions on an as-needed basis, such as civil protection dispatches, public security
operations, guarding operations, maritime security operations, interception and destruction of ballistic missiles
and others, disaster dispatches, earthquake dispatches, nuclear disaster dispatches, and countermeasures against
violations of Japanese airspace. These missions are called second priority missions. The primary missions of
the SDF thus comprise the first priority mission and second priority missions[2].
The SDF has participated in a variety of international peace cooperation activities. Such activities were not
given the status as a primary mission, instead they are positioned as supplementary missions that Chapter 8
(miscellaneous provision) or the supplementary provision of the SDF Law provide for, in line with a concept of
utilizing the SDF’s capacity developed for the defense of Japan under normal circumstances.


-----

In the meantime, the SDF has been engaged in the operations based on the Law Concerning Measures to
Ensure the Peace and Security of Japan in Situations in Areas Surrounding Japan, as well as minesweeping and
evacuation of Japanese people who live abroad; however, such operations were considered supplementary.

**2. Review on Positioning of Missions**
The National Defense Program Guidelines (NDPG) call for proactive efforts to promote peace and stability in
the international community for the sake of ensuring Japan’s own peace and security and, to that end,
international peace cooperation operations have been positioned as one of the roles of the defense forces. It is
also stated in the NPDG that necessary arrangements should be made to engage actively in international peace
cooperation activities in an appropriate manner, including appropriately positioning international peace
cooperation activities within the SDF missions as priorities.
Situations in areas surrounding Japan, if left unaddressed, could eventually lead to armed attacks against
Japan; from the standpoint of ensuring the peace and security of Japan, therefore, they are issues of
significance. Furthermore, disposal of mines abandoned during the Second World War as well as
minesweeping activities for the safe navigation of ships are important operations for ensuring the safety of the
Japanese people. Given that many Japanese people visit or reside in overseas locations, the evacuation of
Japanese people who live abroad at a time of conflict or other situation is also considered an important activity
to ensure public safety.
A structure is needed so that the MOD can appropriately fulfill these roles required of defense forces in the
new security environment. As part of the abovementioned development of a structure, these operations shall be
upgraded from the traditional position of supplementary missions to primary missions of the SDF.
For the SDF to proactively undertake international peace cooperation activities, progress will be needed in
setting up education/training and other systems, in the area of improving the readiness of necessary units, and
enhancing transport capabilities. In order for this to happen, it would be appropriate to review the place of
international peace cooperation among the SDF’s missions and stipulate them as a primary mission.
Making Japan’s efforts for international peace cooperation as the primary mission will send a message not
only to the Japanese public but also to the international community. This will also enable SDF members active
in a challenging environment to focus on their duties with greater self-awareness and pride.
Stipulation of international peace cooperation as the primary mission simply revises the place of
international peace cooperation activities already set out within the SDF Law and does not assign new missions
to the SDF. Nor does it alter the nature (e.g., scope and authority) of SDF activities such as international peace
cooperation activities and international emergency relief activities specified in the current law; these activities
will continue to be implemented within a constitutional framework in accordance with the provisions of the
laws on which these activities are based.

**3. Operations Newly Stipulated as Primary Missions**
Among those operations historically positioned as supplementary missions, the following were stipulated as
primary missions.
1) Activities that contribute to maintaining the peace and security of the international community including
Japan, including international disaster relief operations, international peace cooperation operations,
operations based on the Anti-Terrorism Special Measures Law, and operations based on the Law Concerning
Special Measures on Humanitarian and Reconstruction Assistance in Iraq[3]

2) Activities conducive to ensuring the peace and security of Japan in situations arising in areas surrounding
Japan, such as rear area support and other activities based on the Law concerning Measures to Ensure the

3) Activities to ensure the safety of the lives and property of the Japanese people, such as minesweeping and
the evacuation of Japanese nationals abroad
In stipulation of these operations as part of the primary missions of the SDF, substantial matters associated
with international peace cooperation operations of the SDF as well as responses to situations in areas
surrounding Japan were incorporated into the Security Council Establishment Law as matters for deliberation
at the Security Council, an advisory body to the Prime Minister, in order to enhance civilian control of the
military. (See Fig. II-3-2-5)

**Q&A**

**How has the Self-Defense Forces Law been amended to upgrade international peace**
**cooperation activities to a primary mission of the Self-Defense Forces?**

Article 3 of the Self-Defense Forces Law, which defines the mission of the Self-Defense Forces, has been
amended as shown below:

[Article 3 before amendment]
Article 3
1. The primary mission of the Self-Defense Forces shall be to defend Japan from a direct or indirect
invasion, and if deemed necessary, the Self-Defense Forces shall ensure to maintain public order.
2. Omitted

[Article 3 after amendment]
Article 3
1. The first priority mission of the Self-Defense Forces shall be to defend Japan from a direct or
indirect invasion in order to protect peace and independence and maintain security of Japan, and if
deemed necessary, the Self-Defense Forces shall ensure to maintain public order.
2. In addition to the mission prescribed in the preceding paragraph, the Self-Defense Forces shall
perform activities that fall under either of the following and that the Self-Defense Forces are
permitted separately by an act to conduct as its mission within the limit that does not hinder the
performance of the first priority mission defined in the preceding paragraph and to the extent that
the activity does not involve the threat or use of force.
i. Activities that are determined to be instrumental in securing peace and security of Japan, and
performed to deal with a situation occurring in areas surrounding Japan that may severely affect
peace and security of Japan
ii. Activities that are determined to be instrumental in maintaining peace and security of the
international society including Japan, and performed as a contribution to operations for
international peace organized mainly by the United Nations and to promote other international
cooperation activities.
3. Omitted.


-----

The activities performed to deal with a situation that “may severely affect peace and security of Japan”
as provided in Article 3 Paragraph 2 Item i are specifically the activities based on the Law Concerning
Measures to Ensure the Peace and Security of Japan in Situations in Areas Surrounding Japan and the
Ship Inspection Operations Law.
The activities that are “determined to be instrumental in maintaining peace and security of the
international society including Japan” as provided in Article 3 Paragraph 2 Item ii are specifically the
activities based on the International Peace Cooperation Law, the International Disaster Relief Law, the
Anti-Terrorism Special Measures Law and the Law Concerning Special Measures on Humanitarian and
Reconstruction Assistance in Iraq. The purpose of this item is to make activities by the International
Disaster Relief Teams and support activities based on the Anti-Terrorism Special Measures Law, as well
as “operations for international peace organized mainly by the United Nations,” primary missions of the
SDF.
Activities to protect lives and property of the people, such as minesweeping and evacuation of
Japanese nationals residing abroad in an emergency situation, are considered part of activities to “ensure
to maintain public order” as set forth in Article 3 Paragraph 1, and have also become a primary mission of
the SDF.

**[COLUMN]**

**Q&A**

**International peace cooperation activities have been upgraded to a primary mission of**
**the Self-Defense Forces. Does this mean that the SDF now can perform any activity**
**without limits in foreign countries?**

Newly added Article 3 Paragraph 2 of the Self-Defense Forces Law sets out that the Self-Defense Forces
performs activities that are “permitted separately by an act to conduct as its mission.”
As this provision indicates, activities do not become a mission of the SDF unless permitted by other
act to conduct. The SDF cannot perform any new activities abroad on the grounds of Article 3 Paragraph 2
alone.
The intention behind the upgrading of international peace cooperation activities to a primary mission
of the SDF is to modify the positioning of international peace cooperation activities (which are already
regulated by other act) in the Self-Defense Forces Law, and not to add new missions to the SDF. The
scope of activities that the SDF is allowed to perform, as well as the authority held by the SDF, during
peacekeeping operations (PKO) and international disaster relief operations are as defined by the current
applicable law without any change, and these activities continue to be conducted in accordance with their
respective act and within the framework of the Constitution as they have been.

**[COLUMN]**

**Q&A**

**Why have activities to respond to situations in areas surrounding Japan been upgraded**
**to a primary mission?**

These activities are performed when a situation in areas surrounding Japan threatens to develop into an
armed attack against Japan unless no countermeasures are taken, or when other situations that may
severely affect peace and security of Japan occur in areas surrounding Japan. The activities are therefore
closely connected with peace and security of Japan.
For this reason, the Ministry of Defense is of the view that it is appropriate to upgrade—along with
international peace cooperation activities—these activities to respond to situations in areas surrounding
Japan to a primary mission as well.



**[COLUMN]**

**Q&A**

**Why have minesweeping and evacuation of Japanese nationals residing abroad in**
**emergency situations been upgraded to a primary mission?**

Minesweeping is an activity to secure safety for vessels navigating in Japan's territorial waters as well as
for Japanese vessels in high seas. The evacuation of Japanese nationals residing abroad in emergency
situations is an activity to save their life and secure their safety. These activities are therefore important
for the purpose of ensuring to maintain public order, including to protect life and property of the people.
For this reason, the Ministry of Defense is of the view that it is appropriate to upgrade—along with
international peace cooperation activities—these activities, including the evacuation of Japanese nationals
residing abroad, to a primary mission as well.


-----

**[COLUMN]**

**Q&A**

**Why have activities based on the Anti-Terrorism Special Measures Law and the Law**
**Concerning Special Measures on Humanitarian and Reconstruction Assistance in Iraq**
**been upgraded to a primary mission?**

The Anti-Terrorism Special Measures Law defines measures implemented by Japan as a contribution to
activities of forces of other countries performed, by eliminating threats posed by the 9/11 attacks, to fulfill
the objectives of the United Nations Charter. The Law Concerning Special Measures on Humanitarian and
Reconstruction Assistance in Iraq was enacted to provide humanitarian and reconstruction assistance to
Iraq based on the Security Council resolution No. 1483 by joining international efforts to rebuild Iraq.
The activities in accordance with these laws are “instrumental in maintaining peace and security of the
international society including Japan” through promoting international cooperation, and, in this sense,
share the purpose with peacekeeping operations (PKO). For this reason, and from the viewpoint of
boosting morale of SDF personnel already involved in these activities, it is appropriate to upgrade the
activities to a primary mission.

**4. Development of a Legal Structure Related to Transition to a Ministry and Stipulation of**
**International Peace Cooperation as SDF’s Primary Mission**

As mentioned earlier, the transition to the MOD and the stipulation of international peace cooperation as an
SDF’s primary mission are steps in the development of a structure to 1) strengthen defense policymaking/planning functions, 2) enhance and strengthen the systems of the response to emergency situations, and
3) engage in proactive efforts for the peace and stability of the international community.
In order to take measures for the aforementioned purposes, the government submitted a bill concerning
partial amendment of the Defense Agency Establishment Law on June 9, 2006. This same bill was passed on
December 15, 2006 (see Item 3, “3 Circumstances Surrounding the Transition to a Ministry” for more details
on the process).
This bill collectively addresses issues of transition to a ministry, stipulation of international peace
cooperation as the primary mission of the SDF, and addition of international peace cooperation operations and
responses to situations in areas surrounding Japan to the agenda for deliberation by the Security Council. The
following is an outline of the bill.

**(1) Partial Amendment of the Defense Agency Establishment Law**

the Director-General of the Defense Agency (Article 8); provision of operational materiel prior to defense
operations orders (Article 77-3); Rear-Area Support (Article 84-4-1, 84-4-2-1/2); ACSA (Article 100-6, 7);
and notification of areas for expropriation of goods during defense operations (Article 103)).

**b. Matters Related to Stipulation of International Peace Cooperation as SDF’s Primary**

Japan, and the Law Concerning Ship Inspection Operations in Situations in Areas Surrounding Japan) (See
Fig. II-3-2-6)

**(3) Partial Amendment of the Security Council Establishment Law**
The Security Council Establishment Law shall be partially amended to incorporate important items concerning
international peace cooperation operations and responses to situations in areas surrounding Japan into items for
deliberation by the Security Council.

**(4) Amendments in Supplementary Provisions and Others**
❍ There shall be a clear statement that the Defense Facilities Administration Agency is to be abolished and
merged into the main body of the Ministry of Defense in FY 2007, which, together with other measures, will

**Q&A**

**How has the government been explaining the transition to a ministry**
**to the people of Japan?**

It is extremely important for the government to obtain understanding and support of the people of Japan as
regards making the transition from the Defense Agency to the Ministry of Defense, and therefore the
government has been carrying out extensive PR activities.
Prior to the transition, the government issued 290,000 copies of pamphlet titled “Making the
Transition from the Japan Defense Agency to a Ministry” with the aim of giving answers to why the
transition is necessary and other questions the people may have. The pamphlets were distributed, and
explanations as to the transition were given, widely to local governments and the public via the SDF units
and local organizations throughout the country.
After the transition, the government issued and distributed 65,000 copies of pamphlet titled “For the
Creation of Peace,” and explanations as to the transition were given, widely to local governments and the
public via the SDF units and local organizations throughout the country.
The series of regional meetings to explain the significance and details of the transition were also held
in five cities: Tokyo, Nagoya, Nagasaki, Asahikawa, and Osaka.
The Ministry of Defense has been providing a detailed explanation of the transition in the “Defense of
Japan” whitepapers. The Ministry has also actively been disclosing such information on its website and in
PR magazines as well as responding to questioning in Diet sessions and receiving interviews from various
media.
The Ministry of Defense will continue to actively perform PR activities at every possible opportunity
to explain the transition to related local governments in order to obtain understanding from more people,
and thereby fulfill its accountability.



**[COLUMN]**

**Q&A**

**Will the transition to a ministry lead to an increase in defense spending?**

The transition of the Japan Defense Agency to a ministry is a change in the positioning of an
administrative organization, and therefore does not require any additional budget measures nor cause an
increase in defense-related spending in the future.
Under the current severe financial situation, the Japanese government is vigorously promoting the
reduction and rationalization of spending. The Ministry of Defense is also working hard to radically
rationalize and enhance efficiency of defense-related spending in accordance with the National Defense
Program Guidelines, the Mid-Term Defense Program and other plans decided at the Cabinet meetings,
while maintaining harmony with other policies of the government.

**VOICE**


**The Road to the Establishment of the Ministry of Defense**

**Takahiro Yoshida**
**Senior Staff, Planning Office,**
**Administrative Coordination Division,**
**Minister's Secretariat, Ministry of Defense**

The Japan Defense Agency was upgraded to a
ministry on January 9 of this year. Many inside
and outside Japan welcomed this transfer,
expressing high expectations for the ministry, but
its process was not easy at all.
As the ruling parties began earnest discussion
on the transfer in January last year, a team
dedicated for the transfer was formed within the
Administrative Coordination Division of
Minister's Secretariat, which is responsible for
organization administration and legislation.
However, soon after the team was established,
serious problems occurred—the bid-rigging Senior Staff Yoshida at work
scandal of the Defense Facilities Administration
Agency and the divulgence of confidential information caused by Winny. The discussion by the ruling
parties was suspended, and it seemed that the transfer to a ministry was almost hopeless. Many media
reported that the bill would be put on the back burner. However, all the staff at the Defense Agency was
united and intensively discussed countermeasures, and these efforts resulted in the announcement of the
measures to prevent recurrence of similar problems as early as in late March.
The ruling parties resumed discussion. The name of the ministry, the framework of the bill, reasons
why the transfer should be implemented now, and other matters were actively discussed between the
ruling parties and within the government for many days. After overcoming a number of difficulties, the
ruling parties finally reached agreement, and submitted the bill to the Diet on June 9 nearly at the end of
the ordinary Diet session as a Cabinet-sponsored bill already agreed by all the government agencies. It is
very rare for the ruling parties and the government to submit a bill at the last moment like this, and the bill
was the last bill submitted under the Koizumi administration.
However, there was an even higher barrier to overcome in the extraordinary Diet session in autumn.
The Diet needed to deliberate the defense ministry bill as well as other important bills such as the
amendment of the Fundamental Law on Education during the short session. The bill was facing rough
going. The opposition parties refused to discuss with the government many times, and we had to spend
many hard days with lingering fear that the bill may be rejected. However, the considerable efforts of
many people again opened up a way to overcome these difficulties, and the bill was passed in the House
of Representative on November 30 by winning approval of more than 90% of the legislators. It was about
two months after the session opened on September 26, and only two week before it will close. The bill
was passed barely in time.
Severe debates continued in a tense atmosphere in the House of Councilors as well, and there was a
fear that the bill will run out of time if anything goes wrong. However, these difficulties were also


-----

overcome, and the bill was passed in the House of Councilors on December 15 at the almost end of the
extraordinary session by, again, winning approval of more than 90% of the legislators.
The team I belonged to undertook a wide range of operations under these political movements. We
solved every issue related to the bill in a very detailed manner while preparing the bill, such as the
framework of civilian control, authority of the Minister of Defense, enactment of the law within the same
fiscal year, abolition and integration of the Defense Facilities Administration Agency, and influence on
other laws. We also created Q&A pamphlets and other literature, as well as explained at meetings held in
various locations, in an as easy-to-understand manner as possible. The road to the establishment of the
ministry was so hard that we all felt greatly rewarded when the bill was passed.
One of the largest purposes of the transfer to a ministry is to encourage us at the ministry to undertake
even greater responsibility for security and national defense, become even more active in planning
policies, and produce more favorable results. The transfer to a ministry was realized through enthusiasm
and efforts of supporters and as a reflection of high expectations of people toward the ministry and the
Self-Defense Forces. I believe that the ministry must prove itself as valuable for the country in the future
by meeting those expectations.

Section 3. Organization of the MOD/SDF

The Self-Defense Forces (SDF), the core of Japan’s defense capability, is a specialist organization that plays
the most essential role in the continuous survival of the country, that is, national defense. The SDF consists of a
full range of units and services that provide the functions required to fulfill that responsibility.
The MOD/SDF must conduct regular reviews to ensure that their organizations are suited to the times so
that they can properly address the policy issues of a new age. To this end, the MOD has just in the previous
fiscal year carried out an organizational restructuring to strengthen its policy-planning functions and its system
for cooperation with local governments, and further restructuring is to be done this fiscal year to ensure more
appropriate and effective execution of its assigned tasks.
This section looks at the organization of the MOD[5]/SDF and the restructuring thereof.

**1. Organization of the MOD/SDF**

**1. Organization of the MOD/SDF**
The MOD/SDF consist of a number of organs that center on the Ground Self-Defense Force (GSDF), Maritime
Self-Defense Force (MSDF) and Air Self-Defense Force (ASDF), enabling them to fulfill their mission of
defending Japan as armed organizations, and other number of organs including the National Defense Academy,
National Defense Medical College, National Institute for Defense Studies, Defense Intelligence Headquarters
(DIH), Technical Research and Development Institute (TRDI), Equipment Procurement Office, and Defense
Facilities Administration Agency. (See Figs. II-3-3-1 • 2)

**2. System to Support the Minister of Defense**
The Minister of Defense, in accordance with the provisions of the SDF Law, is in charge of the SDF, and
supported by the Senior Vice Minister of Defense and two Parliamentary Secretaries of Defense. The Minister
of Defense is supported by the Administrative Vice Minister of Defense in supervising administrative work,
and the Defense Counselors in setting up basic policies, respectively.
Moreover, the Internal Bureau, Joint Staff Office, Ground Staff Office, Maritime Staff Office, and Air Staff
Office (GSDF Staff, MSDF Staff, ASDF Staff) support the Minister of Defense. The Internal Bureau is
responsible for basic policies relating to the work of the SDF. The Director-General of the Secretariat and
Director-Generals of Bureaus, as part of their own responsibilities, support the Minister of Defense when the
Minister of Defense gives instructions and authorization to the Chief of Joint Staff Office (Chief of Joint Staff),
and Chief of Ground Staff (GSDF Chief of Staff), Chief of Maritime Staff (MSDF Chief of Staff) and Chief of
Air Staff (ASDF Staff). The Joint Staff Office is a staff organization for the Minister of Defense concerning
SDF operations. The Chief of Joint Staff Office supports the Minister of Defense by providing unified military
expert advice on SDF operations. The Ground Staff Office, Maritime Staff Office and Air Staff Office are the
staff organizations for the Minister of Defense concerning their respective services (excluding operations), with
the Chiefs of Staff for the GSDF, MSDF and ASDF acting as the top-ranking expert advisors to the Minister of
Defense.

**2. Restructuring of the Defense Agency (previous fiscal year)**
In August 2004, (then) Director-General of the Defense Agency issued Director-General instructions on
examining the Agency’s organization to allow it to appropriately address policy issues in a new security
environment and to enhance and strengthen the assistant system for (then) Defense Agency’s Director-General.
This initiated broad-ranging studies within the Agency and, after submission of the final report on these
examinations in August 2005, the FY 2006 budget was allocated and the necessary revisions to laws made. In
July 2006 a review of the Advisary Structure by Civilian DGs and a restructuring of internal bureaus, local
organizations and acquisition organizations were carried out. An overview of the restructuring is shown in Fig.
II-3-3-3.

**3. Restructuring of the MOD (current fiscal year)**
Even after the restructuring of the previous fiscal year, the MOD continued to pursue reforms from a variety of
perspectives—preventing bid-rigging and other such problems, enhancing policy-planning functions and crisis
management capabilities as a ministry, developing a system emphasizing interaction with the general public,
and exploring organizational approaches that could help smooth U.S. force realignment—and decided to carry
out large-scale restructuring this fiscal year. Below are an explanation of the process of examination and an
overview of the new organization. (See Fig. II-3-3-4)

Facilities Administration Bureaus

**1. Examination Process**
On January 30, 2006, senior officials of the Defense Facilities Administration Agency and other persons were
arrested on the suspicion of interfering with competitive bidding in relation to construction work on charges of
having interrupted construction biddings for defense facilities. The former Defense Agency reacted by
establishing an “Investigative Committee on Matters Pertaining to Defense Facilities Administration Agency
Bidding Collusion” and a “Study Group on Fundamental Measures to Prevent Defense Facilities
Administration Agency Bidding Collusion,” conducted a thorough investigation into the facts of the matter and
considered measures to prevent recurrences. This investigation determined that steps should be taken to 1)
dismantle the Defense Facilities Administration Agency and integrate its functions into the Defense Agency, 2)
strengthen mutual supervision functions with regard to order placement procedures for construction work, and
3) enhance agency-wide audit and inspection functions.
In March 2006 recommendations were forthcoming from ruling parties. The Liberal Democratic Party
project team under the National Defense Division offered recommendations that included creating a robust


-----

internal audit system directly responsible to the minister, segregating contract and integration organizations and
having them exercise mutual oversight functions, and substantially restructuring internal bureaus and local
organizations. The Security Study Group of the New Komeito Party submitted to the (then) Defense Agency a
proposal on carrying out substantial reorganization by transferring the functions of the Defense Facilities
Administration Agency to the Defense Agency, reinforcing mutual check functions, and strengthening audit
functions.
As these recommendations emerged, it became necessary by the end of August to organize the different
points of discussion, establish organizational details, and prepare a preliminary budget request. The Committee
to Study a New Defense Organization after Dissolution of the Defense Facilities Administration Agency
headed by (then) Defense Agency Director-General Nukaga was set up on April 7, 2006, for these purposes,
and the Committee conducted an organizational study toward preparing a budget request.
Once this study was brought to a conclusion, a budget request was submitted at the end of August 2006,
after the necessary matters coordinated within the government, the budget examined by the Diet and the new
organization then incorporated into this fiscal year’s budget. The new organization is scheduled to be
restructured during this year; the key elements in this restructuring are described below.

**2. Abolition of the Defense Facilities Administration Agency and Consolidation into the Ministry of**
**Defense**

The abolition of the Defense Facilities Administration Agency and the consolidation of its functions into the
MOD emphasize 1) development of a system for administering facilities more suitably and efficiently, 2)
maintenance and expansion of relations with local communities that previously had been assigned to Defense
Facilities Administration Agency, and 3) construction of a structure for cooperation with local governments on
the full range of defense-related matters, including facility administration.
To suitably address the policy issues of a new age, among these being the smooth realignment of U.S.
forces and effective responses to a variety of situations, it has become all the more important that the MOD
establish close relations with communities, especially local governments and local residents.
From this perspective, functions such as local coordination, measures pertaining to communities in the
vicinity of Defense facilities, acquisition/management/return of facilities, constructing of facilities for
provision to U.S. forces stationed in Japan, procurement of goods and services, and labor management that
previously had been assigned to the Defense Facilities Administration Agency’s Facilities Department and
Support Department will be transferred to the Internal Bureau, with new offices to be set up within the Internal
Bureau to serve as liaison points with communities on facilities administration and other matters. In addition to
facility administration, responsibility for tasks relating to securing the understanding and cooperation of local
governments and local residents will be clearly indicated.
Of the functions covering construction work previously assigned to the Defense Facilities Administration
Agency’s Construction Division, those tasks related to standards for bidding and contracting will be assigned to
an internal bureau (Bureau of Finance and Equipment), while all other tasks concerning implementation (e.g.,
preparation of technical standards and screening of plans) will be given to the Equipment and Facilities
Headquarters. A system will be developed to further ensure fairness and transparency in tasks concerning
construction work.
Following this restructuring, MOD policy-making/planning will be carried out by internal bureaus, and
practical implementation of these policies as well as the procurement of equipment will be under the charge of
the Equipment and Facilities Headquarters. This arrangement will make possible more effective policies and
facility installation.


-----

**3. Restructuring of Internal Bureaus**
The MOD must utilize the opportunity presented by its transformation into a ministry to meet the expectations
and trust of the public as a policy organ. To prove itself worthy of these expectations and trust, the MOD must
suitably address the policy issues of the new age, including effectively dealing with U.S. force realignment and
other circumstances that may arise. Accordingly, the MOD will restructure its internal bureaus so that it can
propose a variety of policy options and implement them as a policy organ. More specifically, the MOD will
newly create the following organizations:
1) a Planning and Evaluation Division (tentative name) in the Minister’s Secretariat and a Japan-U.S. Defense
Cooperation Division (tentative name) in the Bureau of Defense Policy to bolster policy-planning functions
so that the MOD can respond suitably to new issues and circumstances, and
2) a Defense Councilor and its aide—a U.S. Force Realignment Coordination Officer (tentative title)—to
ensure smooth and steady realignment of U.S. forces.
The MOD will also enhance its international functions in order to more strategically engage in defense
exchanges and confidence building with other countries (tentative name: International Policy Division) and its
policy-making/planning functions pertaining to the service discipline of MOD personnel (new Service
Management Officer [tentative title] to be appointed).

**4. Creation of the Inspector General’s Office of Legal Compliance, MOD**
In addition to incidents such as the bid-rigging case at the Defense Facilities Administration Agency, incidents
involving leaks of information and drug use and others gravely injurious to public trust have made it necessary
for the MOD to establish a rigorous ministry-wide inspection system to prevent the recurrence of such
incidents and to ensure that MOD personnel comply with all relevant laws and standards of professional
conduct in the execution of their duties. To that end, the Inspector General’s Office of legal compliance, MOD,
headed by the Inspector General will be established.
This special organization will report directly to the Minister of Defense and will have high degree of
independence; the Inspector General will conduct ministry-wide inspections on the orders of the Minister. The
Inspector General will be of assistant administrative vice-minister rank, and the necessary personnel, including
appointed outside personnel, are to be assigned to the Inspector General’s Office of legal compliance, MOD,
and their expertise utilized. The Inspector General’s Office of legal compliance, MOD, will carry out
inspections and establish overlapping audit and inspection systems, in particular with respect to compliance
with laws and regulations.

**5. Creation of New Local Defense Bureaus**
Relations between the MOD and local communities are of growing importance. Therefore, the Defense Facility
Administration Bureaus (local branches of the Defense Facilities Administration Agency) and the local offices
of the Equipment Procurement Office will be integrated when abolishing/consolidating the Defense Facilities
Administration Agency, and Local Defense Bureaus will be created to serve as local bureaus for the MOD in
overseeing the full gamut of defense administration functions at the local level, including coordination and
discussions with communities on defense policies.
The Local Defense Bureaus will have comprehensive responsibility for defense administration in their
territories, including:
1) tasks connected with facility administration at the local level that have been performed by the Defense
Facility Administration Bureaus;
2) tasks connected with equipment procurement that have been carried out by the local offices of the
Equipment Procurement Office; and
3) tasks connected with securing the understanding and cooperation of local governments and local residents in
order to smoothly and effectively implement tasks assigned by the MOD.


-----

**Notes**
1) On June 20, 1964, (then) Defense Agency Director-General Fukuda explained to the House of
Representatives’ Cabinet Committee why the bill had not been submitted to the Diet: “We believed that
upgrading to ministry status was appropriate from all perspectives, and we still feel strongly that this is
necessary. Unfortunately, however, time constraints led to a variety of delays and, given the extremely
short time left in the term of the current Diet session, we regrettably concluded that the prospects of
submitting to this Diet session were not good.”
2) On the primary missions (prior to revision of the SDF Law) of the Self-Defense Forces, Article 3 of the
Self-Defense Forces Law stipulates that “the first priority mission of the SDF shall be to defend Japan
against direct or indirect invasion, and if necessary the SDF shall ensure to maintain public order.”
3) See Part III, Chapter 3, Section 1 on the stipulation of the international peace cooperation as SDF’s
primary mission.
4) It was pointed out in the discussions among the ruling parties on the transition to a ministry that the
connection between the abolition/merge of the Defense Facilities Administration Agency in FY 2007
following the bid-rigging incident at the Agency and other incidents, and the bill for the transition to a
ministry is unclear, although both are related to the organization of the Defense Agency. The abolition of
the Defense Facilities Administration Agency has therefore been clearly stipulated in the supplementary
provisions.
5) The MOD and the SDF are the same administrative authority responsible for defense. The term “Ministry
of Defense,” however, is used to describe the administrative entity that carries out the work of
management and administration of the GSDF, MSDF and ASDF, whereas the term “SDF” refers to the
armed services themselves, whose duty is to defend the country through the activities of their units.

Section 1. Frameworks for Responses to Armed Attack Situations

It is of utmost importance for the national government to establish a basic system to deal with the most serious
situations for the peace and security of the country and its people, such as armed attacks against Japan. In
particular, it is naturally essential to establish the legislation to facilitate the operations of the Self-Defense
Forces (SDF) and U.S. forces to terminate armed attack situations[1], as well as the legislation to protect the lives
and properties of the people, which constitutes a base of existence of the nation. The national government has
long sought after the establishment of these legislations.
These laws and the establishment of an SDF operational structure, etc., provide the foundation for SDF
activities, enable the SDF to effectively respond to armed attacks, and contribute to deterring armed attacks
against Japan (hereinafter the term “armed attack situations” refers to armed attack situations and situation
where an armed attack is anticipated[2]). They are also important, in terms of ensuring civilian control during
armed attack situations.
This section will outline the framework of Japan’s responses in the occurrence of armed attack situations
and an SDF operational structure based on the framework.

**1. The Basic Framework for Responses to Armed Attack Situations**

**1. The Background to Laws for Responses to Armed Attack Situations**
In 1954 the Defense Agency Establishment Law and the Self-Defense Forces Law were enacted in order to
establish the Defense Agency and the SDF as organizations to defend the peace and independence of Japan, as
well as to maintain the national security, based on which the framework of the legal structure for the responses
to armed attacks against Japan was developed. Yet, matters that requiring further development remained.
In 1977, at the Defense Agency, too, the then Director-General Mihara received the approval of the then
Prime Minister Fukuda, and directed the commencement of the study on so-called “emergency legislations,”
with a purpose of identification of the issues associated with the remaining inadequacy of the legal structure.
Then, for almost a quarter century, the study continued.
In February 2002, the then Prime Minister Koizumi clearly mentioned in the administrative policy speech
at the 154th ordinary session of the Diet that the Japanese government would seek the concrete development of
legal systems, “so as to advance building of a nation that is strong in emergencies.” In light of this, as the
legislation needed for responding to armed attacks on Japan and other situations (legislation for responses to
situations), the three laws related to responses to armed attack situation, including the Armed Attack Situation
Response Law, were enacted in 2003. Furthermore, the seven laws including the Civil Protection Law[3] as the
legislation for responses to situations were enacted in 2004, three related treaties were also ratified, and the
legal foundation known as emergency legislation[4] was established. (See Fig. III-1-1-1)

**2. Responses to Armed Attack Situations**
The Armed Attack Situation Response Law[5] serves as the basic law for responses to armed attack situations,
and provides for the fundamental principles regarding responses to armed attack situations, and the
responsibilities and roles to be shared by the national and local governments, as well as a basic plan regarding
responses to armed attack situations (basic response plan). The law has established a framework under which
related organizations (designated government institutions, local governments, and designated public
institutions[6]) may take their response measures in cooperation with each other based on individual emergency
legislations for responses to situation, including the Civil Protection Law and the nation as a whole may take
all possible measures to respond to armed attack situations.

**(1) Fundamental Principles of Reponses to Armed Attack Situations**

**Fig. III-1-1-1 Relationship between Three Laws Related to Emergency Legislation**
**and Seven Laws Related to Emergency Legislation, and Related Treaties**

**The Armed Attack Situation Response Law**

In order to ensure national independence and security as well as the safety of the people,
the posture for response to armed attack situations is prepared by stipulating the basic items such as the fundamental principles,
responsibilities of the national and local governments, and procedures; and,
the law clearly states the policy, items and system for examinations on the development of individual legislations that become
necessary when responding to armed attack situations.

**a. In responding to armed attack situations, the national government, local governments and designated public**
institutions must take all possible measures in mutual collaboration, while obtaining cooperation from the
people.

**b. In situation where an armed attack is anticipated, any and all measures must be taken so as to avoid the**
occurrence of such an attack.

**c. Under an armed attack situation, preparations must be made against an armed attack. In the event that an**
armed attack actually breaks out, such an attack must be repelled, and an attempt for prompt termination of
the situation must be implemented. However, the use of armed forces in eliminating an attack must be


-----

limited to the extent determined as reasonably necessary under the situation, if an armed attack actually
breaks out.

**d. In responding to armed attack situations, people’s freedom and rights guaranteed by the Constitution must be**
respected, and restrictions on them, if any, must be the minimum necessary for responding to the situation,
and such restrictions must be according to fair and appropriate procedures.

**e. Under armed attack situations, the situation and responses to it must be notified to the people in a timely and**
appropriate manner.

**f. In responding to armed attack situations, efforts must be made to secure the understanding and cooperation**
from the international community such as the United Nations, while cooperating closely with the United
States in accordance with the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty.

**(2) Systems and Procedures for Responding to Armed Attack Situations**
If armed attack situations break out, the government must follow the procedure in Figure III-1-1-2 for
responding to the situation in normal cases. (See Fig. III-1-1-3)

-----

**(4) Responsibilities and Role of the National and Local Governments**
**a. Responsibilities and Role of the National Government**
In responding to armed attack situations, the national government as a whole must take any and all prudent
measures, including the response measures, by mobilizing all of its organizations and functions in line with the
fundamental principles.

**b. Responsibilities and Role of Local Governments**
Local governments, which are obligated to protect the local area and the lives, bodies and properties of their

**(5) Authority of the Prime Minister over Response Measures**
When a basic response plan is established to implement the response measures in a comprehensive manner, a
task force for armed attack situations (the Task Force) is established within the Cabinet with the Prime Minister
being the Task Force Chief. The Deputy Chief and other posts of the Task Force will be filled by other
Ministers of State.
The Prime Minister may instruct heads of relevant local governments to implement necessary measures
when particular needs are recognized but necessary measures based on comprehensive coordination are not
implemented, and when the protection of people’s lives, bodies or properties, or the repelling of an armed
attack is being hindered.
The Prime Minister may implement the response measures that should be implemented by local
governments or the designated public institutions by giving direct order or by orchestrating relevant Ministers
of State to implement such response measures in accordance with the urgency, after notifying the head of local
governments, and when necessary response measures are not implemented as instructed, and when such
lacking of actions is causing problem in protecting people’s lives, bodies or properties, or hindering the
repelling of an armed attack.

**(6) Report to the U.N. Security Council**
The national government must immediately report the measures it has taken to repel an armed attack to the
U.N. Security Council, in accordance with the relevant provisions, including Article 51 of the U.N. Charter.
(See Reference 76)

**3. Responses to Emergency Response Situations[7]** **other than Armed Attack Situations**
The Armed Attack Situation Response Law provides that the Japanese government must respond rapidly and
appropriately to emergency response situations[8] other than armed attack situations, in order to ensure the peace
and independence of the nation, and to maintain the security of the nation and its people.
In addition, based on changes in various situations surrounding Japan, including incidence of armed
suspicious boats and occurrences of mass terrorism, measures shall be promptly taken including the following:


-----

1) development of the systems for assembly of information, and analysis and evaluation of situations; 2)
preparation for formulating response measures in accordance with various situations; and 3) enhancement of
the coordination of the SDF with the police and the Japan Coast Guard.

**(1) Emergency Response Situation Response Plan, etc.**
If an emergency response situation has broken out, the Cabinet shall decide on the Emergency Response

Response Situation shall be temporarily established within the Cabinet :
1) Acknowledgement of an emergency response situation and the facts supporting the acknowledgement;
2) General plan for responses;
3) Important matters regarding emergency response measures.

**(2) Emergency Response Measures**
The designated government institutions, local governments or the designated public institutions must conduct
the following measures as emergency response measures, in accordance with the provisions of laws during the
period between the formulation and termination of an Emergency Response Situation Response Plan:
1) Measures to prevent or suppress attacks, or other measures that are implemented to terminate the emergency
response situation depending on the progress of the situation.
2) Warnings, evacuation instructions, rescue of victims, emergency restoration of facilities and installations,
and other measures that are implemented to protect the lives, bodies and properties of the people from
attacks under the emergency response situation, or to minimize the effects on people’s livelihoods and the
economy that are caused by attacks under the emergency response situation, depending on progress of the
situation.

**2. Measures based on the Armed Attack Situation Response Law and other Relevant**
**Laws**

Based on the framework presented in the legal structure, the Armed Attack Situation Response Law enacted in
June 2003 provides that individual emergency legislations for responses to situations should be established in
the future so that measures to protect lives of the people and so on, measures to minimize the effects caused by
an armed attack on daily lives of the people, and measures to facilitate effective operations of the SDF and the
U.S. forces that are needed to repel armed attacks must be taken. The law further provides that these individual
emergency legislations for responses to situations should guarantee the appropriate implementation of the
International Humanitarian Law.
In March 2004, the national government submitted seven bills concerning emergencies and three treaties
related to responses to situations to the Diet for approval. In June 2004, the seven bills and ratification of the
three treaties were approved by the Diet. As a result, a framework of measures to be taken under armed attack
situations has been established. The outline of the framework is as follows: (See Fig. III-1-1-4)

**1. Measures to Protect the Lives of the People and to Minimize the Effects on the Daily Lives of the**
**People**

The Civil Protection Law was enacted. The Law provides for the responsibilities of the national and local
governments, the cooperation of the people, measures to evacuate residents, measures to support displaced
residents, measures to respond to disasters caused by armed attacks, and other measures that should be
performed or implemented to protect the lives of the people and to minimize the effects on the daily lives of the


-----

people. The Civil Protection Law provides that similar measures may be taken under emergency response
situations.

**2. Measures to Terminate Armed Attack Situations**

**(1) Facilitation of Operations of the SDF**
The Maritime Transportation Restriction Law[9] was enacted. The Law provides that the measures to restrict
maritime transportation of foreign military supplies (including weapons) in the territorial waters of Japan and
high seas surrounding the territorial waters of Japan may be taken if an armed attack situation breaks out.


-----

**(2) Facilitation of Operations of U.S. Forces**
**a. The U.S. Military Actions Related Measures Law[10]** was enacted. The law provides that measures to facilitate
effective operations of U.S. forces necessary to repel an armed attack pursuant to the Japan-U.S. Security
Treaty may be taken in armed attack situations.

**b. The Agreement between the Government of Japan and the Government of the United States of America**
Concerning Reciprocal Provision of Logistic Support, Supplies and Services between the Self-Defense
Forces of Japan and the Armed Forces of the United States of America (ACSA) (the Acquisition and CrossServicing Agreement)[11] was partially amended, and the amended ACSA provides that the scope of its
application is enlarged to include responses to armed attack situations, efforts of the international
community to contribute to international peace and security, and activities to respond to disasters. The SelfDefense Forces Law was partially amended so that the SDF may provide the U.S. forces implementing the
aforesaid operations with supplies and services. (See Chapter 2, Section 3)

**(3) Others (Coordination of the Use of Facilities of Ports and Airfields, Roads, and Others)**
The Specific Public Facilities Use Law[12] was enacted. The law provides that the use of specific public facilities
(facilities of ports and airfields, roads, waters, airspace and radio frequencies) shall be coordinated in a
comprehensive manner under armed attack situations, for the purpose of proper and rapid implementation of
measures such as operations of the SDF and U.S. forces and measures to protect the people.

**3. Guarantee of Appropriate Implementation of the International Humanitarian Laws**
(1) The Prisoners of War Law[13] was enacted and the system was established to ensure that prisoners are always
treated humanely under an armed attack situation, and the life, body, health and honor of the prisoners shall
be respected, and always protected from any violations of, or threats to, their rights.

(2) The Law Concerning Punishment of Grave Breaches of the International Humanitarian Laws[14] was enacted.
The law provides that “grave breaches” of the International Humanitarian Laws, which are applied for
international armed conflicts, must be properly penalized.

(3) In addition, the Protocol Additional to the Geneva Convention[15] of 12 August 1949 and relating to the
Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts[16] (Protocol I) and the Protocol Additional to the
Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of Non-International
Armed Conflicts[17] (Protocol II), which are the main international humanitarian laws, were ratified. The
domestic implementation of these of protocols was thus guaranteed by the enactment of individual laws for
responses to situations as mentioned above.

**4. High Readiness for Armed Attack Situations**
Upon the enactment of the emergency legislation, the legal ground was established. However, consistent efforts
are required to ensure the effectiveness of legislations and to improve the operational posture in accordance
with the legislations, in order to respond to the constantly changing security environment.
Therefore, the Special Advisory Committee for Contingency Planning[18] established under the Security
Council is currently conducting studies on responses to armed attack situations or emergency situations,
including terrorist attacks and the emergence of suspicious boats. Designated government institutions, local
governments and designated public institutions that are expected to implement response measures in armed
attack situations have begun to establish plans to suit their roles and reflect their roles in actual policies and
services.


-----

Even in a normal situation, the Japanese government needs to make efforts to enlighten the people at large,
through various opportunities, about the importance of various measures to be taken for the protection of the
lives, bodies and properties of the people from armed attacks against Japan, regarding responses to situations,
and to improve the measures while verifying the effectiveness of the operational posture via exercises.

**3. Measures for Protection of Civilians**

**1. Measures for Protection of the People in Armed Attack Situations (Civil Protection Measures)**
In case of armed attack situations, the Japanese government shall respond to such situations to protect the lives,
bodies and property of the people, and to take measures to minimize the adverse effects of such an armed
attack on people’s livelihood and the national economy. The government shall, pursuant to basic response plan
of the armed attack situation response law and its already formulated basic guidelines for the protection of
people, mobilize all of its organizations and functions to exert every possible effort in self-implementation of
measures for protection of the civilian populations, and shall support civil protection measures implemented by
local governments and designated public institutions, so that the whole nation can adequately cope with those
situations.
In addition, local governments, under the policy of the government, shall implement their respective civil
protection measures and comprehensively facilitate civil protection measures of designated local public
institutions in their jurisdictions. (See Fig. III-1-1-5)

**2. The Basic Guidelines for Civil Protection**
In March 2005, the Japanese government formulated the Basic Guidelines for Civil Protection (hereinafter
referred as the “Basic Guidelines”[19]) based on Article 32 of the Civil Protection Law. In the Basic Guidelines,
anticipated armed attack situations are classified into the following four types, landing invasion, guerrillas and
special operations force attacks, ballistic missiles attacks, and aerial intrusion. Additional elements for
consideration are provided for each type in the implementation of civil protection measures. Furthermore, the
Basic Guidelines provide the contents of measures implemented and roles played by the national government,
prefectures, municipalities, and designated public institutions within the possible scope for civil protection
measures in terms of evacuation, relief and disaster responses.
The Ministry of Defense and the Defense Facilities Administration Agency, which are the designated
government institutions, have formulated the Civil Protection Plan of the Defense Ministry and the Defense
Facilities Administration Agency based on the Civil Protection Law and the Basic Guidelines. (See Reference
33 • 34)

**3. Roles of the SDF in Civil Protection**

**(1) The SDF and Protection of the People**
In the case of armed attack situations, it is important for the SDF to promptly repel such an attack to minimize
the damage to civilians. The SDF will endeavor to pursue the aforementioned duty, which can only be
implemented by the SDF.
Therefore, in contrast to responses to natural disasters (such as disaster relief operations) where the SDF
can focus its ability on lifesaving and recovery assistance alone, the SDF is to implement measures to protect
civilians, such as the guidance of evacuated residents, relief of evacuated residents and others, responses to
armed attack disasters, and emergency recovery, as much as it can without interfering with its duty to repel
armed attacks, depending on the scale and type of armed attack situations.

**(2) Civilian Protection Dispatches**
Along with the enactment of the Civil Protection Law, the Self-Defense Forces Law was amended to allow the
SDF to implement the civil protection measures, and Civilian Protection Dispatch was newly established as
operations of the SDF.
The details of the operations are not different from the disaster relief operations in natural disasters, but
since they are operations under the circumstances of armed attack situations, provisions have been established
regarding the use of weapons and the approval of the Prime Minister. (See Fig. III-1-1-6)
Where a defense operation is ordered in an armed attack situation or an internal security operation is
ordered as countermeasures against an emergency response situation, the civil protection measures or
emergency response protection measures will be implemented as part of the defense operation or internal
security operation without ordering any civilian protection operation.
An outline of the provisions regarding the civil protection operation is as follows:


-----

**a. Dispatch Procedure**
The Minister of Defense, when requested by a prefectural governor and the situation is considered unavoidable,
or when requested by the Task Force Chief[20], shall order units for civilian protection dispatch and
implementation of civil protection measures after receiving the approval of the Prime Minister.

**b. Authorities Similar to Those of Policemen**
The SDF personnel ordered for civilian protection dispatch may, only in cases when police officers are not on
the scene, exercise authority over evacuation measures, prevention and restriction of crimes, access, and use of
weapons pursuant to the Law Concerning the Execution of Duties of Police Officers.

**c. Authorities Similar to Those of Municipal Mayors**
The SDF personnel ordered for civilian protection dispatch may, only in cases when municipal mayors are not
on the scene, exercise authority over instructions on evacuation, public contributions concerning emergencies,
establishment of caution areas, and requests to local residents for cooperation pursuant to the Citizen’s
Protection Law.


-----

**d. Temporary Organization of Units**
For civilian protection dispatches, temporary special units can be organized as needed, and the SDF ready
reserve personnel and reserve personnel may be called up accordingly.

**e. Emergency Response Protection Measures**
Similar provisions shall be stipulated for measures for emergency response situations.

**(3) Civilian Protection Measures by the Ministry of Defense and the SDF**
The Ministry of Defense and the Defense Facilities
Administration Agency, which are designated
administrative agencies, formulated the Civil
Protection Plan[21] in October 2005 based on Article 331 of the Civil Protection Law and the Basic
Guidelines. The plan states that the SDF shall
implement its primary duty of repelling armed attack
with its full power, and also execute measures to
protect civilians, such as evacuation and relief of
residents, and the implementation of responses to
armed attack disasters, as much as possible, within the GSDF’s 14th Infantry regiment (Ishikawa prefecture) guiding evacuees in civilian
scope possible while not interfering with its main duty. protection exercise
The SDF shall conduct the following measures.

**a. Evacuation of Residents**
The SDF, in coordination with related organizations, implements guidance and transportation of evacuated
residents, as well as collection and provision of necessary information. In addition, when asked by local
government heads for passage through SDF bases for evacuating residents, it must promptly make adjustments
and take procedures to this end.

**b. Relief of Evacuated Residents**
The SDF implements lifesaving measures (search and rescue, provision of first aid, and others), such as
medical assistance (transportation of the injured) in response to requests from the task force director and others,
and as appropriate, measures for livelihood support (preparation of hot meals, water supply, and transportation
of aid supply). In addition, it gives permission to use facilities of the Ministry of Defense for the purpose of
relief.

**c. Responses to Armed Attack Disasters**
The SDF checks on the damage (monitoring support, and other activities), lifesaving (search and rescue,
provision of first aid, and others), prevention of amplification of the damage (evacuation support of peripheral
people, fire fighting, and others), removal of hazardous substances caused by attacks using NBC weapons, and
so on. In addition, it implements support for securing safety of living-related facilities (instruction/advice,
personnel dispatches, and so on).

**d. Emergency Recovery**
The SDF is engaged in emergency recovery of facilities and equipment over which the Ministry of Defense
holds jurisdiction, and upon request from prefectural governors, it provides assistance to removal of dangerous
rubble and emergency repair of roads and runways.


-----

**e. Responses to Emergency Response Situations**
Implementation procedures and contents based on measures for civil protection shall be implemented for
measures in emergency response situation.

**4. Activities by the Ministry of Defense and the SDF to Facilitate the Civil Protection**
**Measures**

**1. Participation in Training for Civil Protection**
With the establishment of the emergency legislation, the legal foundation for measures necessary to repel and
terminate armed attacks as well as implementation of measures for protecting the people including evacuation
measures of residents have been completed for the responses to the most critical situations for peace and safety
of the country and its people, including armed attacks against Japan. In addition, the formulation of the Civil
Protection Plan based on the Civil Protection Law made the responses of the Ministry of Defense and the SDF
clear in terms of their implementation of civil protection measures. Hereafter, for adequate and expeditious
implementation of measures to protect the people in armed attack situations, it will be important to arrange
coordination procedures related to implementation of measures for protecting the people in collaboration with
each of the ministries, agencies, and local authorities.
From this perspective, the Ministry of Defense and the SDF have been actively participating in and
cooperating with civil protection training conducted by the relevant agencies such as the Cabinet Office,
prefectural governments, and local public organizations. By continuing these efforts, the Ministry of Defense
and the SDF will make stronger coordination with related organizations. (See Fig. III-1-1-7)

**2. Coordination with Local Governments in Peacetime**
In order to establish a close coordination with local governments in peacetime and to make civil protection
measures effective, the Ministry of Defense and the SDF newly established the Provincial Liaison &
Coordination Division in the GSDF Army Headquarters. In order to strengthen the functions related to
coordination and cooperation with local authorities, the post of Civil Protection and Disaster Relief
Coordinator was newly placed within the SDF Provincial Liaison Office, and its name was changed to the
Provincial Cooperation Office. (See Chapter 4, Section 1)

**VOICE**

**Voice of SDF Personnel who Participated in a Joint Field Exercise for Civil Protection:**
**Having Participated in the Tottori Prefecture Civil Protection Field Exercise**

**1st Lieutenant Keiji Inoue**
**Medical Unit, 13th Logistics Support Regiment,**
**GSDF**

The Medical Unit of the 13th Logistics Support
Regiment stationed in Kaitaichi, Hiroshima
Prefecture, as well as the 8th Infantry Regiment
stationed in Yonago City, Tottori Prefecture,
participated in a civil protection field exercise
organized jointly by the Cabinet Secretariat and
the Tottori Prefectural Government in November
last year.
It was the first exercise for us to be conducted
for a terrorist attack using chemicals and other
weapons. Partly because of the Tokyo subway Members of the Medical Unit, 13th Logistics Support Regiment treating a
sarin attack that occurred in March 1995, the person injured by chemicals during the Tottori Prefecture Civil Protection Field

Exercise

exercise attracted great attention of the press, and
was conducted in a very tense atmosphere.
We wore a protective mask and chemical protection clothes, and treated people who were injured by
chemicals and others and carried to us one after another. Because of the mask, gloves and other protective
equipment, we had difficulties in moving smoothly to undertake delicate treatment, and could not even
freely speak with each other. At the same time, however, we could not afford to waste even one moment
in the treatment of the injured. Despite these extremely difficult conditions, we managed to treat them
appropriately thanks to the training we had been regularly receiving.
This exercise provided us with an opportunity to perform a medical assistance operation through
coordination with the local governments, police, fire departments and other organizations, as well as to
share information with private medical institutions regarding treatment of the injured. The exercise was
therefore very significant as it allowed us to strengthen the collaboration of all those concerned in the
field.
I could feel the diversity of our mission through this exercise. I could also recognize anew how
important regular training is to fulfill our mission. I will continue to work hard to develop skills of my
own as well as of the unit so that we can meet the expectations of the people.

**5. The Operation of the Self-Defense Forces**
On March 27, 2006, the Ministry of Defense and the SDF shifted to a joint operations posture, in which the
Chief of Staff, Joint Staff Office (Joint Chief of Staff) solely assists the Ministry of Defense on SDF operations
matters from the stand point of military experts. This prepared the SDF for unified operations with the Ground
Self-Defense Forces (GSDF), the Maritime Self-Defense Forces (MSDF), and the Air Self-Defense Forces
(ASDF), including peacetime, and enables the SDF to effectively respond to its diversifying roles in a timely
manner.

**1. Outline of Joint Operations Posture**

**(1) Basic Concept**
**a. Joint Chief of Staff develops a concept regarding unified operations for the GSDF, MSDF and ASDF, and**
solely assists the Minister of Defense on SDF operations with military expert’s viewpoint.

**b. The Minister of Defense commands SDF operations through the Joint Chief of Staff, and the Joint Chief of**
Staff executes the orders for SDF operations.

**(2) Establishment of Central Organization Required for Joint Operations**
To establish the joint operations posture, the Joint Staff Council Office and Staff Offices of the GSDF, MSDF
and ASDF were reviewed in order to improve their efficiency, and the Joint Staff Office was newly created. As
a result, the structure for assisting the Minister of Defense by the Joint Chief of Staff and the Chiefs of Staff of
the GSDF, MSDF and ASDF has been formed as follows:

**a. Sole Assistance by Joint Chief of Staff to the Minister of Defense on SDF Operations with**
**Military Expert’s Views, and the Responsibility of Chiefs of Staff of the GSDF, MSDF and**
**ASDF for Building up their Respective Units**

The Joint Staff Office, which was created in place of the conventional Joint Staff Council Office, performs
functions concerning SDF operations that were transferred and consolidated from the Staff Offices of the
GSDF, MSDF and ASDF, and each of the Staff Offices is maintaining such functions as personnel service,
defense build-up, and education/training. In other words, the Joint Chief of Staff is responsible for operating
units, while each Chief of Staff of the GSDF, MSDF and ASDF is responsible for building up units.
In addition, the Joint Chief of Staff clarifies what is needed for smooth execution of joint operations
missions in view of the functions performed by the Chiefs of Staff of the GSDF, MSDF and ASDF. Each Chief
of Staff, based on these needs, takes various measures to ensure the effectiveness of joint operations. (See Fig.
III-1-1-8)
The intelligence required for SDF operations shall be provided to the Joint Staff Office and units by the
Defense Intelligence Headquarters via the Department of Current & Crisis Intelligence.

**b. Execution of the Minister’s Orders for SDF Operations by the Joint Chief of Staff**
The Joint Chief of Staff executes the Minister’s orders for all operations of the GSDF, MSDF and ASDF,
including defense operations, public security operations, and international disaster relief operations. The
Minister’s commands executed by the Joint Chief of Staff include situation where “Joint Task Forces[22]” are
organized, and where only an SDF unit is mobilized (for example, only a unit of the GSDF is mobilized) to
respond to the situation. (See Fig. III-1-1-9)

**2. Establishment of Infrastructure to Enhance the Joint Operations Posture**
In order for the SDF to respond to emerging new threats and a wide variety of situations with the joint
operations posture, it is essential for the SDF to establish a reliable system for communicating command orders
and sharing intelligence instantly between the Joint Staff Office and individual SDF units. For this purpose, the
SDF Command and Communication Squadron (tentative name) will be newly established in this fiscal year to
enhance the communication function that is directly linked to the operations of units. And, establishment of
broad-based and mobile intelligence and communication infrastructures is required with domestic and foreign
excellent information technology. (See Part II, Chapter 2, Section 4)
At the unit level as well, commanders of a major units[23], who may potentially take command of a “joint
task force,” must develop plans to prepare for such occasions during normal conditions as well as maintain a
posture capable of executing missions through exercises and others. Staff from other SDF units is to be
stationed at major command headquarters during normal conditions to enhance the coordination by overcoming
barriers among the GSDF, MSDF, and ASDF with additional staff to be allocated, when necessary, in the case
of taking measures against various situations in joint operations.
As we approach one year since the transition to the joint operations posture, the Ministry of Defense
continues to study the enhancement of education/training activities by conducting joint exercises, the
organizational structure of SDF commands, developing human resources appropriate for joint operations, and
the necessity of standardizing equipment to pursue effective and efficient operations posture based on actual
performance, and the necessary measures to be taken.

**3. Placing the Defense Intelligence Headquarters under the Direct Command of the Minister of**
**Defense**

Along with the transition to joint operations posture, the status and roles of the Defense Intelligence
Headquarters (DIH) was clarified as “the central intelligence service for the Ministry of Defense” in March
2006. Before the transition, DIH was placed under the Joint Staff Council, and after the transition it was placed
under the direct command of the Minister of Defense.
This change enables the intelligence organization of the Ministry of Defense to collect extensive
information with holistic views, conduct advanced analyses with broad understanding of needs of internal
organizations, and enhance its function to make reports to the Minister of Defense rapidly, accurately and
directly.

Section 2. Effective Reponses to New Threats and Diverse Contingencies

The National Defense Program Guidelines (NDPG) defines the primary role of the defense force to be the
effective responses to new threats and diverse contingencies due to consideration of the security environment
which has radically changed by the proliferation of ballistic missiles, weapons of mass destruction, and the
activities of international terrorist organizations. Among new threats and diverse contingencies the following
five are listed with the examples of primary responses and the concept of the SDF structure: 1) responses to
ballistic missile attacks, 2) responses to attacks by guerrillas and special operation forces, 3) responses to
aggression on offshore islands, 4) warning and surveillance in sea areas and airspace surrounding Japan, and
responses to the violation of airspace as well as responses to armed special operations vessels, and 5) responses
to large-scale and special-type (nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological) disasters. These situations can
seriously affect Japan’s peace and security, and how to provide prompt and adequate responses is a major issue
for the Ministry of Defense and the SDF. (See Part II, Chapter 2, Section 2)
This section describes how the SDF should respond to new threats and diverse contingencies including the
five items presented in the NDPG under the joint operations posture as well as the issues on which the Ministry
of Defense and the SDF have been working.

**1. Response to Ballistic Missile Attacks**
While various efforts have been made by the international community in recent years for non-proliferation of
ballistic missiles and weapons of mass destruction, the proliferation still continues. In July 2006 North Korea
launched 7 ballistic missiles, and this incident reconfirmed the reality of the danger of ballistic missile attacks.
With this background, Japan began instituting a ballistic missile defense (BMD) system in FY 2004 to
further ensure its preparedness to respond to ballistic missile attacks. In 2005 necessary amendments were
made to the SDF Law.
In December 2005, the Security Council and the Cabinet decided to begin Japan-U.S. joint development of
advanced BMD interceptor missiles. (See Fig. III-1-2-1)

**1. Japan’s Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD)**

**(1) Overview of the BMD System Development**
**a. Basic Concept**
The BMD system, which the Japanese government has been developing since the Cabinet decision of
December 2003, is based on the concept of a multi-tier defense system, which executes Aegis vessels[24] for
upper-tier interception and Patriot system (PAC-3 (Patriot Advanced Capability-3))[25] for lower-tier
interception, replying on the improvement to the capabilities of Aegis vessels and surface-to-air Patriot systems
currently possessed by the SDF.

**b. Configuration of the BMD System**
Japan’s BMD system adopts a multi-tier weapon system that intercepts in-coming ballistic missile by Aegis
vessels in the midcourse phase and by the Patriot system in the terminal phase. The entire system consists of
the multi-tier system and the sensors to detect and track ballistic missiles flying toward Japan, and the
command/control and communication systems that effectively link weapons and sensors to systematically
counter ballistic missiles. (See Fig. III-1-2-2)

**Fig. III-1-2-2 Concept of BMD Deployment and Operation (Image diagram)**

**c. Policy for Introducing the BMD System**
In introducing the BMD system, the utilization of current equipment will be promoted from the perspective of
developing an effective and efficient system while reducing acquisition and maintenance cost. In addition to
the above-mentioned improvement in the capabilities of the Aegis vessels and the Patriot system, an improved


-----

type of the current ground radar system will be used in the area of sensors. Also, the newly introduced radar
system FPS-5[26], which can detect both conventional airborne threats (air planes and others) and ballistic
missiles, will be used in combination with the improved ground radar. The same policy applies to the Japan
Aerospace Defense Ground Environment as a command/control and communications system.

**d. Status of Introducing the BMD System**
In March 2007 Patriot PAC-3 was introduced to the
4th Air Missile Defense SQ of 1st Air Missile Defense
Group at Iruma Air Base of the ASDF (Saitama
prefecture) as Japan’s first intercepting method, to
form the BMD system, and Prime Minister Shinzo
Abe visited to inspect the system on April 13th, 2007.
The Ministry of Defense and JSDF plan to continue
with the introduction of the BMD system, and the
current target is to develop a system FY 2011 that
links the command/communication system with four
Aegis vessels (with the added BMD capability),

Defense Group (Saitama prefecture), and Prime Minister Abe observing this

sixteen Patriot PAC-3 FUs[27] (fire units), four FSP-5 system
radars, and seven FPS-3 radars (improved type).
In the FY 2006 budget for the BMD system, approximately a total of 157.2 billion yen (on a contract base)
was appropriated for 1) improvement in the capability of the Aegis vessels, and the acquisition and launch test
of SM-3 missiles, 2) improvement in the capability of the Patriot system and the acquisition of PAC-3 missiles,
and 3) the introduction of a new warning and control radar system (FPS-5).
In consideration of the event that North Korean launched ballistic missiles in July 2005, approximately 3.7
billion yen (on a contract base) has been appropriated as an additional measure for enhancing Japan’s posture
for collecting information, and for warning and surveillance.
In the revised budget for FY 2005, approximately a total of 14.2 billion yen (on a contract base) was
appropriated for early acquisition of PAC-3 missiles and the improvement of electronic data gathering aircraft
(EP-3).

**(2) Future Capability Improvement**
The proliferation of ballistic missile technology still continues, and the possibility cannot be denied that
ballistic missiles possessed by nations will develop into those with measures for avoiding interception such as
using decoy to deceive interception of warheads. It is therefore necessary to continue improving the
interception capabilities that matches such advances in ballistic missiles.
Expansion of the defense coverage and improvement in the interception probability are also required to the
conventional ballistic missiles, and it is necessary to increase the efficiency and reliability of the BMD system
by improving the kinetic energy performance of interceptor missiles.
Based on these perspectives, the Mid-Term Defense Program states that the improvement of Aegis vessels
and the Patriot system for the next fiscal year and onward (after achieving the defense capability listed in the
schedule of the NDPG) shall be studied and then necessary measures shall be taken with consideration of the
status of BMD technology development in the United States. As for the Japan-U.S. joint technical research that
began in 1999, joint development started in 2006 based on research outcomes obtained so far. Furthermore,
efforts to improve future capabilities have been made, such as Japan-U.S. joint development to improve the
capabilities of radar and combat command systems. (See Figs. III-1-2-3 • 4)

**2. Improvement in Legislations and Operations**

**(1) Legal Measures regarding Responses to Ballistic Missiles**
In cases when ballistic missiles and other objects[28] are launched toward Japan as armed attacks, defense
operations for armed attack situations will be ordered and the missiles will be intercepted.
On the other hand, when ballistic missiles are bound for Japan but no armed attack situation is
acknowledged and no defense operations are ordered, the SDF is allowed to take the following actions by fully
taking into account 1) the taking of prompt and appropriate actions, and 2) the ensuring of civilian control. (See
Reference 70)

**a. When the Minister of Defense recognizes that there is sufficient possibility that ballistic missiles and the like**
fly toward Japan based on pre-indications, he or she may order SDF units to take measures for destroying the
missiles with the approval of the Prime Minister. Possible actions taken by the SDF in such situations
include deploying the Patriot system of the ASDF and the Aegis vessels of the MSDF under the order of the
Minister to prepare for incoming ballistic missiles, and destroying the missiles under the previously issued
order when the missiles actually fly toward Japan.

**b. In addition to a) above, there may be cases where situations suddenly change, such as when almost no**
information is available on missile launches or when missiles are launched mistakenly or accidentally, and
there is no time for the Minister of Defense to obtain the Prime Minister’s approval. In preparation for such
occasions, the Minister of Defense can prepare emergency response procedures and have them approved by
the Prime Minister under normal circumstances, and in order to protect lives and properties within the
territory of Japan the Minister of Defense can issue an advanced order to SDF units for a given period of
time, in accordance with the emergency response procedures, to destroy ballistic missiles with Aegis vessels
when they actually fly toward Japan. (See Fig. III-1-2-5)

-----

**(2) Concept of Ensuring Civilian Control of Military**
Responses against ballistic missiles and the like require not only responses by the SDF but also actions by the
government as a whole, such as alerting and evacuating the people for protection, taking diplomatic activities,
gathering of information by the departments concerned, and strengthening preparedness for emergencies. When
ballistic missiles are actually flying toward Japan, the destruction of such missiles is necessary using
interceptor missiles. Also, the Japanese government needs to make a judgment on the possibility of missiles
flying toward Japan by comprehensively analyzing and evaluating the specific condition and international
situations.
In view of the importance of such incidents and the necessity of actions taken by the Japanese government
as a whole, the approval of the Prime Minister (Cabinet decision) and individual orders of the Minister of
Defense are required so that they can sufficiently fulfill their responsibilities. In addition, the involvement of
the Diet is clarified by having clear statement in the law on ex post facto reporting to the Diet.
In March 2007 the Minister of Defense drafted and the Prime Minister approved an emergency response
procedure defining how SDF units should respond to emergencies and cooperate with relevant government
agencies where ballistic missiles are flying toward Japan and there is no time to obtain an approval from the
Prime Minister due to sudden changes in situations. With this approval, Japan now has its own system
necessary for conducting timely and adequate responses, including emergency events. (See Reference 30)

**(3) Operational Efforts**
**a. Responses to Ballistic Missiles through Joint Operations**
The destruction of incoming ballistic missiles and the like shall be performed by integrating MSDF’s Aegis
vessels, ASDF’s radars, the Patriot system, and the command/control and communications system. As for the
operation of the BMD system, effective responses are being studied including unified operations led by the
Commander of Air Defense Command as an example, and various postures are being developed. The GSDF
will play the main role in dealing with the damage caused by the impact of ballistic missiles.

**b. Japan-U.S. Cooperation in Responding to Ballistic Missile Attacks**
Further cooperation with the U.S. forces in Japan as well as with the U.S. government is required for the
efficient and effective operations of the BMD system. Related measures were agreed upon at the Japan-U.S.
Security Consultative Committee (2+2) meetings in October 2005, in May 2006, and May 2007 presenting the
direction for Japan-U.S. security cooperation. (See Chapter 2, Section 2 • Chapter 2, Section 3)

**3. Missile Defense of the United States and Japan-U.S. BMD Cooperation**

**(1) Missile Defense of the United States**
The United States aims to develop multi-tier missile defense system in which interception systems suitable for
1) the boost phase, 2) midcourse phase, and 3) terminal phase of the flights, and they are combined and
complement each other to defend against missiles. These systems will be introduced as they become
available[29]. (See Fig. III-1-2-6)
In June 2006, the United States Forces in Japan introduced transportable radar for BMD in the Shariki
Subbase of the ASDF (Aomori prefecture). In September 2006, Patriot PAC-3 units were placed in Kadena Air
Base. In addition, Aegis vessels with BMD capabilities are being forward-deployed in Japan and the
surrounding area since August 2006.

In 1999 the government decided to start Japan-U.S. joint technical research on a sea-based upper-tier system
(the current sea-based midcourse defense system) with the approval of the Security Council of Japan in 1998.
This joint technical research carries out design, prototype and necessary tests of interceptor missiles with
higher capabilities than the sea-based midcourse defense system that Japan is currently introducing. So far, the
design, prototypes and necessary tests of four major components[30] have been carried out.
The Japan-U.S. joint technical research has completed the verification of elemental technologies and
obtained the prospects for solving technical issues. In December 2005, the Security Council and the Cabinet
decided on transitioning to joint development, using the outcomes of the Japan-U.S. joint research as a
technological foundation for the development of interceptor missiles with improved capabilities. In June 2006,
the Japanese and U.S. governments reached an official agreement on this matter. In FY 2006 approximately
21.7 billion yen was appropriated for the joint development of future BMD system. (See Fig. III-1-2-7) (See
Reference 29)

Japan’s BMD program is structured by improving the capabilities of the Aegis vessels and Patriot system
currently possessed in Japan, and it does not conflict with the Three Principles on Arms Exports.
However, the Japan-U.S. joint technical development of BMD systems for future improvement involves
the necessity of exporting BMD-related arms to the United States as part of the development. When the
decision was made in December 2005 on transition to the joint developments, it was determined that the Three
Principles on Arms Exports would not apply under the condition that strict control is maintained and a
framework for the provision of arms required to be exported to the U.S. would be developed through
coordination with the United States, in accordance with Chief Cabinet Secretary’s statement made in December
2004.
In June 2006, letters concerning the provision of arms and arms related technology to the United States
were exchanged, and that established a framework to provide arms and arms-related technology under tight
control, for example prohibiting use for purposes to which Japan had not agreed in advance, and prohibiting
transfer to third countries. (See Part II, Chapter 2, Section 2)

**(4) Strengthening the Japan-U.S. Cooperation on BMD**
Since the decision was made to introduce BMD systems to Japan, efforts have been continuously made to
strengthen the Japan-U.S. BMD cooperation.
The Mid-Term Defense Program indicates the measures for strengthening the Japan-U.S. Security
Arrangements as the government of Japan will strengthen Japan-U.S. bilateral efforts to enhance ballistic
missile defense capabilities and to promote cooperation with the United States in the areas of defense policy,
operations, and equipment and technology. Furthermore, the Cabinet decided to exchange letters concerning


-----

BMD cooperation between the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the U.S. Ambassador to Japan. Following the
Cabinet decision, a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on BMD cooperation was signed between Japan
Defense Agency (then) and the U.S. Department of Defense in 2004.
Additionally, in June 2006 the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the U.S. Ambassador to Japan exchanged a
letter concerning BMD cooperation, including Japan-U.S. joint development.

**4. North Korea’s Ballistic Missiles Launch and Japan’s Response**

**(1) The Incident of Ballistic Missile Launch**
On July 5 last year North Korea launched seven ballistic missiles toward the Sea of Japan.
From Kittaeryon in the southeast coast region of North Korea, six ballistic missiles, which were suspected
to be Nodong or Scud, were launched and impacted on the Sea of Japan. The circumstance of this round of
missile launches is considered to have the characteristics of actual aggression, and implies that North Korea has
been improving the operation capability of ballistic missiles.
Out of seven missiles, the third missile was suspected to be a Taepodong-2, and was launched from the
Taepodong district on the east coast region of North Korea. However, it was disintegrated in mid-air and
dropped in the area near the launch area, and is assumed to have failed the launch. (See Fig. III-1-2-8) (See Part
I, Chapter 2, Section 2)


**Fig. III-1-2-8 Locations of North Korea’s Missile Launch**

**(2) Response of the Japanese Government**
In response to the missile launch by North Korea, the Japanese government set up a response office in the
Prime Minister’s Office and held the Security Council to discuss the responsive actions of Japan. At 8:20a.m.,
a statement by the Chief Cabinet Secretary was announced. It strictly protested against North Korea and
expressed its regrets. The Japanese government reminded North Korea of the moratorium on the launching of
ballistic missiles stated in the Japan-DPRK Pyongyang Declaration[31], and strongly required the country to act in
accordance with the declaration and to return to the Six-Party Talk quickly without conditions. On the same
day, the Japanese government also took specific actions including prohibiting port entrance by Man Gyong
Bong 92, prohibiting the entry of North Korean officials in principle, and postponing trips to North Korea by
Japanese civil servants in principle.
In addition, the Japanese government decided to take various response actions as part of coordination with
the international community such as close coordination with the United States, and approaching the U.N.
Security Council[32].
Responding to the actions by the Japanese government, the resolution 1695[33] of the United Nations Security
Council was adopted on July 16, 2005 (on July 15 in New York time), regarding the missile launch by North
Korea.

**(3) Responses of the Ministry of Defense and the SDF**
**a. Postures prior to Missile Launch**
The Ministry of Defense and the SDF have been collecting information regarding missile related activities by
North Korea in peace time, and had captured events which could be seen as an indication of this round of
launch. In addition, Japan and the United States have been exchanging necessary intelligence in peace time in
accordance with the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty.
Based on comprehensive evaluation of information
gathered from various sources regarding this missile
launch, Japan’s warning and surveillance posture had
been reinforced since the end of May under the
command of the Minister of State for Defense (then)
by deploying Aegis equipped vessels, electronic data
gathering aircraft EP-3 in the MSDF, and FPS-3
improved radar (advanced capabilities), FPS-5 radar
under the operation study, electronic measuring
aircraft YS-11EB, and E-767 airborne early warning
and control aircraft in the ASDF.

(SDF personnel at the center bottom of the photo)

**the SDF after the Missile Launch**

Responding to the ballistic missile launch by North Korea, the Minister of State for Defense Nukaga (then)
immediately issued an instruction by the Minister of State for Defense (“Immediate Response to the Event of
Flying Object Launch by North Korea”), and instructed to take thorough actions for the following while closely
coordinating with relevant organizations in Japan as well as with concerned countries including the United
States:
1) searching for the flying objects by relevant units and analyzing of related information by the leadership of
the Defense Intelligence Headquarters and finding facts on this event in detail;
2) continuing the strengthening of the posture of collecting information on future actions of North Korea by the
Defense Intelligence Headquarters and concerned units; and


-----

3) continuing the enhancing of the warning posture by concerned units in preparation for potential ballistic
missile launches.
Furthermore, the “Headquarters of Countermeasures against North Korea’s Flying Object Launch”[34] as set
up, in order for the then Defense Agency to make assurance doubly sure in future collection of intelligence and
responses.
The SDF units dispatched naval vessels and aircraft to the waters where the ballistic missiles might have
dropped to search for fallen objects while enhancing the warning and surveillance postures, and placed liaison
offices in preparation for potential damages.

**(4) Lessons Learned and Issues**
The Ministry of Defense has strengthened and improved its preparedness for information collection, analysis
and communications, as those items were noted as lessons learned in the event of ballistic missile launch by
North Korea in 1998. Due to such improvement and reinforcement, the Ministry of Defense was able to
execute information collection, analysis and reporting promptly and appropriately in the event of this round of
ballistic missile launch by North Korea.
For example, with information collection activities throughout the stages of capturing indications of
potential missile launch and the stage of actual launch the Minister of State for Defense (then) was able to hold
a press conference and quickly announced information on the missile types, times of launch, estimated impact
points of the missiles, and other items shortly after the launch. These actions contributed to the Japanese
government’s fast initial response after the launch.
Examining the overall cooperation with the U.S. forces, the coordination between Japan and the United
States was good in terms of communication network, information sharing, and response procedure, as a result
of the two nations having carried on close collaboration work for information sharing as well as for responses
prior to the occurrence of the event.
However, some issues still need to be resolved such as early development of BMD system for directly
intercepting ballistic missiles, and improvement and enhancement of the posture of intelligence collection and
analysis.

**(5) Measures taken by the Ministry of Defense and the SDF with Consideration of Missile**
**Launch Incidents**

Regarding the issue of North Korea’s missile launch, Japan needs to promote diplomatic efforts while
coordinating with the international community, and to construct the BMD system quickly along with enhancing
the alliance between Japan and the United States and the operational posture between the two countries, and the
establishment of an information sharing posture.
While the Ministry of Defense and the SDF are developing BMD system in accordance with the plan, new
measures have been added in response to the recent missile launch such as to improve electronic data gathering
aircraft EP-3 to continuously and constantly obtain more advanced intelligence collection and analysis
capability, and to promote the research on advanced infrared sensor for detecting ballistic missiles.
In consideration of the needs for strengthening the capability of faster missile interception, efforts have
been made to reinforce response capabilities by acquiring Patriot missile systems (PAC-3) earlier than timing
in the original plan.
In order to establish a better operational mechanism for the BMD system introduced, deeper study has been
taking place with a greater intensity as Japan proceeds with independent study while participating in
operational consultations with the U.S. forces.

**2. Response to Attacks by Guerrillas and Special Operations Forces**
As Japan is highly urbanized, relatively small-scale infiltrations and attacks can pose a serious threat to the
peace and security of the country. Such attacks take various forms, including illegal actions by infiltrating
armed agents[35], which are to be dealt with primarily by the police, and armed attacks such as destructive actions
by guerrillas and special operations forces, which are a form of aggression on the territory of Japan.

**1. Response to Attacks by Guerrillas and Special Operations Forces**

**(1) Basic Concept**
Armed attacks on Japan by guerillas and special operations forces will be responded to by defense operations.
Forms of armed attacks on Japan include 1) destruction of facilities and attacks on people by irregular forces
such as guerillas, and 2) subversive activities, assassination of important figures and raids on operations centers
by regular forces such as special operations forces.

**(2) Operations to Respond to Attacks by Guerrillas and Special Operations Forces**
In operations to respond to attacks by guerrillas and special operations forces, a posture for information
gathering is promptly established to discover and capture or destroy them at the earliest possible time. While
conducting such operations, it is important to quickly gain control of the situation, to minimize damage from
the assault.

**a. Discovery and Prevention of Approach of Various Types of Ships**
Efforts will be made to identify ships and submarines transporting guerrillas and special operations forces at
the earliest possible timing to prevent them from advancing in the water by using destroyers, submarines, and
aircraft of the MSDF and ASDF.

**b. Search and Discovery of Guerrillas and Special Operations Forces**
When the possibility of infiltration into the territory of Japan by guerrillas or special operations forces is
suspected, the GSDF’s patrol units will be engaged in warning and surveillance activities in coastal areas.
When infiltration actually occurs, the patrol and air
units will search for and find the guerrillas or special
operations forces. Also, guarding postures will be
established as necessary for prompt deployment of
guarding units to protect critical facilities.

**c. Capturing and Defeating Guerrillas and**
**Special Operation Forces**

When guerrillas or special operations forces are found,
fighting units will be promptly gathered in the area to
besiege and capture or defeat them. (See Fig. III-1-2-9)

**(1) Basic Concept**
While the police takes the primary responsibility for responding to illegal activities of armed agents, the SDF
take actions as shown in Figure III-1-2-10 as a basic, in accordance with the development of the incident
occurred.

**(2) Amendment of the Self-Defense Forces Law to Deal with Armed Agents**
In 2001, the SDF Law was amended to add the following provisions in order to allow prompt and effective
responses to armed agents.

**a. Information Gathering Prior to the Order for Public Security Operations**
When there is anticipation of dispatching an order for public security operations and illegal activities by
persons armed with powerful weapons such as rifles and machine guns, and when a special need is identified
for gathering information to help clarify the situation of the incident, the Minister of Defense may order, upon
the consultation with the National Public Safety Commission and with the approval of the Prime Minister,
armed SDF units to gather information on such persons in places where they are likely be found.
The SDF regular personnel engaged in intelligence activities are allowed to use weapons within the
limitations considered reasonably necessary depending on the incident, provided that they have adequate and

legitimate reasons for using weapons to protect their lives or bodies as well as those of other personnel engaged
in the activity. However, they must not harm persons for reasons other than self-defense or emergency
evacuation purpose.

**b. Use of Weapons in Public Security Operations**
SDF personnel engaged in the public security operations are allowed to use weapons to the extent reasonably
judged necessary in light of the circumstances, and when such use resulted to harm a person, it is legally
assessed as a lawful act as provided in the Self-Defense Forces Law prior to the amendment as follows:
1) abating violence or intrusion against people, facilities, and properties which the SDF personnel should
protect as their duties, and
2) suppressing or preventing mass violence or intimidation.
In addition, the amendment includes,
3) suppressing or preventing violence or intimidation by a person who possesses or is reasonably suspected to
possess weapons such as rifles, machine guns (including machine pistols), artillery, chemical weapons, and
biological weapons.


-----

**(3) Measures for Strengthening Cooperation with the Police**
**a. Establishing the Framework for Strengthening Cooperation**
For the SDF to deal with armed agents, it is important to cooperate with the police agency. Accordingly, in
2000, the Basic Agreement concluded in 1954 between the JDA (then) and the National Public Safety
Commission to provide for cooperation procedures in case of public security operations to suppress mass
violence was revised so that it can be applied to illegal activities by armed agents[36]. In addition, Local
Agreements were concluded in 2002 regarding public security operations between GSDF divisions/brigades
and prefectural police forces.
Furthermore, guidelines for joint actions in the events involving armed agents at the time of public security
operations were created jointly with the National Police Agency in 2004 with the aim of adequately
implementing joint actions on sight between the SDF and police force for the situation of public security
operations due to armed agents.

**b. Joint Exercises with the Police**
By July 2005, the GSDF divisions/brigades and the
prefectural police forces, which are parties to the Local
Agreements, conducted joint table-top exercises to
strengthen cooperation at the local level in preparation
for responding to armed agents. Through the exercises,
the SDF divisions and the police forces share an
understanding of measures to deal with armed agents,
and the examination of the procedures for cooperation
between them was deepened based on outcomes of the
exercises.
In October 2005, the Northern GSDF and

GSDF’s 15th Infantry regiment (Kagawa prefecture) participating in a joint

Hokkaido Prefectural Police conducted the first joint exercise with the police
field exercise, and that was followed by the joint field
exercise between the 14th Brigade and all prefectural polices in Shikoku, between the 4th Division and
Fukuoka Prefectural Police, between the 1st Division and the prefectural police of Saitama and Ibaraki,
between the 3rde Brigade and all prefectural polices of Osaka, Nara and Wakayama, and between the 2nd
Division and Asahikawa Area Office of Hokkaido Policy in FY 2006 to confirm the cooperation at the time of
a public security operation. (See Chapter 4, Section 1)

**3. Response to Nuclear, Biological and Chemical (NBC) Weapons**
In recent years, there has been a strong recognition of the danger of the proliferation of NBC weapons and the
means for delivering such weapons, as well related equipments and materials, to terrorists and rogue countries.
Because the use of such weapons of mass destruction could result in indiscriminately mass murder or extensive
environmental contamination, preventing the proliferation of such weapons is a major issue for the peace and
stability of the international community including Japan. The sarin gas attack on subways in Tokyo in 1995[37]

and the incidents of mail containing anthrax in the United States in 2001[38] are proof of the fact that these
weapons have already been transferred and proliferated.

**(1) Basic Concept**
In the event of a so-called NBC terrorist attack on Japan, and when it is regarded as an armed attack on Japan
from outside, the SDF will conduct defense operations and take necessary actions to defend the country and


-----

save victims. Also, in the event of an NBC terrorist attack which does not fall under an armed attack from
outside but against which the general police alone cannot maintain public security, the SDF will conduct public
security operations to suppress the terrorists and assist victims in cooperation with related agencies.
Furthermore, when the incident does not fall under the subject to defense operations or public security
operations, the SDF will conduct disaster relief activities for rescuing victims and preventing the expansion of
damages, and support the related agencies in conducting information gathering about damage caused,
decontamination activities, transporting the injured and sick, and medical activities led by the chemical
protection units of the GSDF and the medical units of the ASDF, GSDF and MSDF.

**(2) Initiatives of the Ministry of Defense and the SDF in Response to NBC Weapons**
The Mid-Term Defense Program provides that the Ministry of Defense and the SDF shall improve the
capability for responding to attacks using NBC weapons. Particularly for responses to biological weapons, it
provides that various necessary functions should be improved in the areas of personnel and equipment,
including detection, identification, protection, prevention, diagnosis and treatment, decontamination, and
human resources development.
Specifically, the GSDF, which will play a central role in various scenes, has increased the personnel
assigned to chemical units, and has acquired protective equipment and materials such as biological weapon
detection vehicles, chemical protection vehicles, decontamination devices, protective gear for individual use,
and chemical protective clothing. In addition, the GSDF is developing NBC detection vehicles. Furthermore,
the GSDF designated personnel who take initial actions in the event of special-type disasters in order to allow
operations to begin within about one hour. The MSDF and ASDF also have acquired protecting equipment and
materials to be used on vessels and at bases. (See Part II, Chapter 2, Section 3)

**(3) Response to Substances Related to Nuclear and Radiological Weapons[39]**

Substances related to nuclear weapons have various effects on the health of those exposed to them, even if they
do not directly cause damage to the human body. Therefore, appropriate protection and exposure control is
required, taking into consideration of the characteristics of such substances.
To a certain degree, internal exposure[40] from inhaling radioactive substances can be prevented by the use of
protective masks and clothing, and external exposure[41] from radiation can be prevented by the use of chemical
protection vehicles. The chemical protection units equipped with these protective devices may conduct
operations with certain limitations.

**(4) Response to Biological Weapons**
**a. Disaster Relief Dispatches in the Event of**
**Biological Terrorism**

Biological agents have certain incubation periods, and
it is difficult to determine whether the disease is
caused by a biological agent based only on initial
symptoms. When biological agents are dispersed
secretly, an anthropogenic cause may be suspected
only after damage has actually occurred and spread.
Therefore, it may be extremely difficult to detect
biological terrorism before damage is actually caused
by it.
In the event of damage caused by biological
agents, medical institutions take the primary GSDF’s Chemical Protection unit (Tokyo) conducting decontamination training

responsibility for responding to the situation, and the SDF will be responsible mainly for decontamination,
transporting patients, and medical activities. (See Fig. III-1-2-11)

**b. Initiatives for Biological Weapons Countermeasures**
Based on the report[42] provided by the Panel on Biological Weapons Countermeasures comprising external
experts in April 2001, the Ministry of Defense and the SDF published the Principles of Defense against
Biological Weapons (hereinafter referred to as the Principles of Biodefense) in January 2002 to present the
overall picture of measures to cope with the biological weapons from the basic operational concept. They also
established the Biological Countermeasures Committee and conducting various actions. As part these efforts,
seminars on how to deal with biological weapons have been held to improve the ability to counter these
weapons through operational studies.
In order to minimize the damage by biological weapons, NBC Medical Treatment Unit will be newly
formed in this fiscal year as a unit directly under the command of the Minister of Defense who makes the
decisions on early diagnosis and treatment policy by utilizing the biological agent medical laboratory units and
quarantining and accommodating the patients suspected for infections.

**(5) Response to Chemical Weapons**
Unlike biological agents chemical agents generally produce damage immediately, and it is extremely important
to take prompt actions at the initial stage of the damage.


-----

The chemical units of the GSDF can deal with chemical agents through the use of their chemical protective
clothing and vehicles. The chemical units and medical units of the GSDF dispatched for disaster relief
operations will detect the chemical agents using detective devices, transport and treat victims, and conduct
decontamination activities, and medical activities in the contaminated areas. Even when the situation does not
require the SDF dispatch, the SDF will, as needed, lend chemical protective clothing and dispatch chemical
unit personnel as liaison officials to relevant agencies.

**3. Response to Aggression on Islands**
In the NDPG Japan’s geographical features are considered vulnerable from the security point of view as they
are narrow with long coastlines and many islands. Particularly, because of the geographical feature of having
many islands, the enemy may invade these islands as one form of armed attack on Japan.

**Operations to Respond to Aggression on Islands**
In order to respond to aggression on islands, it is
important to detect signs of aggression at the earliest
possible time through activities routinely conducted by
the SDF, such as warning and surveillance, and
military information gathering. Operations to respond
to aggression on islands have much in common with
the form of full-scale post-landing operations.
However, if any signs of aggression are detected in
advance, operations will be conducted to prevent the
aggression by the enemy’s units. When no signs of

GSDF’s 12th Infantry regiment (Kagoshima prefecture) training for response to

aggressions are detected in advance and the islands in aggression on islands
question are occupied, operations will be conducted to
defeat the enemy.
In carrying out these operations, agile transportation and deployment of units through joint operations are
essential. The ASDF, GSDF and MSDF shall cooperate with each other and concentrate their units quickly to
prevent and destroy invading enemy troops.

**4. Warning and Surveillance in Sea Areas and Airspace surrounding Japan, and**
**Responses to Violation of Airspace and Armed Special-Operations Vessels**

In order to respond quickly to not only full-scale aggression but also new threats or diverse contingencies, it is
extremely important to conduct, on a routine basis, warning and surveillance activities in Japan’s territorial
waters and airspace and in the surrounding airspace and sea area under normal circumstances, as well as to
gather and process information required for defense. For this purpose, the SDF is engaged in various activities
directly related to ensuring the peace and security of Japan.


-----

**1. Warning and Surveillance in Sea Areas surrounding Japan**

The MSDF patrols the sea areas surrounding
Hokkaido, the Sea of Japan, and the East China Sea
once a day as standard, using P-3C patrol aircraft.
Warning and surveillance is also undertaken by
destroyers and aircraft in a flexible manner as needed,
for example, when surveillance is required for possible
missile launches. Thus, the preparedness to promptly
respond to situations in areas surrounding Japan is
maintained.
Additionally, GSDF coastal surveillance units and

ASDF staff at the air defense command post, Central Air Defense Force (Saitama


prefecture) taking actions against aerial invasion warning and surveillance activities.

**2. Warnings and Emergency Takeoffs (scrambles) in Preparation against Violation of Territorial**
**Airspace**

The ASDF conducts daily 24-hour surveillance of the
country’s territorial and adjacent airspace, using radar
sites throughout the country, E-2C early warning
aircraft, and E-767 early warning and control aircraft
Furthermore, a number of fighter aircraft are always
on standby for immediate takeoff (scramble). When
any aircraft suspected of violating Japan’s territorial
airspace are detected, scrambled fighters will approach
them to assess the situation, and monitor the aircraft as
necessary. When the aircraft is actually violating the

Pilots of ASDF’s 302th Squadron getting on F-4 fighter for scramble territorial airspace, they will issue a warning to leave.

**3. Response to Submarines Submerged in Japan’s Territorial Waters[43]**

**(1) Basic Concept**
As for foreign national submarines navigating underwater in Japan’s territorial waters, an order for maritime
security operations[44] will be issued under the Cabinet decision in 1996[45], and the SDF will request the
submarine to navigate on the surface of water and to show its flag. When the submarine does not respond to the
request, the SDF will request it to leave the territorial waters.

**(2) Measures in Relation to the Submerged Chinese Nuclear Submarine Operating in Japan’s**
**Territorial Waters**

In November 2004, a Chinese submarine navigating
underwater in Japan’s territorial waters surrounding
the Sakishima Islands was found. An order for
maritime security operations was issued according to
Article 82 of the SDF Law and the procedures based
on the Cabinet decision of 1996, and MSDF vessels
and aircraft tracked the submarine continuously until it
reached the high seas. However, it took a considerable
amount of time for the Japanese government to issue
an order for maritime security operations after
receiving information on the submarine’s entering MSDF’s SH-60K patrol helicopter training for anti-submarine warfare using a
territorial waters. Based on the lessons learned from sonar
this event, the government has newly set out the following response plan.

**a Response Plan**
(a) As for a submarine submerged in territorial waters, actions shall be taken, in principle, in maritime security
operations, such as to request to appear on the sea surface and to request to leave from the territorial waters.

(b) When an incident occurs, the Minister of Defense shall promptly issue an order for maritime security
operations, following the required procedures.

❍ For this purpose, when information is obtained on submarines approaching the territorial waters of Japan, it
shall be shared within the government at the earliest timing.

❍ When the submarine enters the territorial waters of Japan, an order for maritime security operations shall be
immediately issued, unless there is any particular reason to the contrary.

(c) Even after the submarine leaves the territorial waters of Japan, maritime security operations shall be
continued for actions such as determining the possibility of reentry, and for identifying the submarine’s
nationality.

(d) Relevant nations shall be contacted, while necessary measures are taken.

(e) The status of the submarine navigating underwater in territorial waters and the actions taken by the
government shall be explained to the public in an appropriate and timely manner, including the
announcement of issuing an order for maritime security operations, while taking into consideration of
security aspects.


-----

(f) To ensure that the above plan will be implemented, necessary manuals (response procedures) shall be shared
by relevant ministries and agencies.

**b. Enhancement and Improvement of Equipments for Responding to Submarines Navigating**
**underwater in Territorial Waters**

The MSDF is enhancing and improving the capabilities for detecting, identifying and tracking foreign
submarines navigating underwater in the territorial waters of Japan as well as for making the intension of the
Japanese government clear to the submarines. It also is maintaining and improving the capabilities for
responding to submarines in shallow water areas.

**4. Response to Armed Special Operations Vessels**

**(1) Basic Concept**
The Japan Coast Guard is primarily responsible for responding to unidentified vessels. However, when it is
deemed extremely difficult or impossible for the Japan Coast Guard to respond to the situation, an order for
maritime security operations will be issued in a timely manner, and the SDF will take actions in cooperation
with the Japan Coast Guard.
Taking into consideration of the lessons learned from and the reflection of the unidentified vessel incident
off the Noto Peninsula in 1999[46], and the unidentified vessel incident in southwest Kyushu in 2001[47], the
Ministry of Defense and the SDF have strengthened cooperation with relevant ministries and agencies, and the
government has taken the best possible necessary actions, in order to allow effective and safe countermeasures
to be taken against unidentified vessels.

**(2) Amending the Self-Defense Forces Law to Respond to Unidentified Vessels**
Legislative reviews were conducted, focusing on the authorization for weapon usage in stopping unidentified
vessels. Following the reviews, the Self-Defense Forces Law was amended in 2001 to add following provisions
for the use of weapons in maritime security operations.
Despite repeated orders to stop the vessel for required inspection in maritime security operations, the crew
of the vessel may refuse to follow the order or attempt to flee. In such a case and when the Minister of Defense
determines that the incident meets certain requirements[48], MSDF personnel engaged in such operations are
allowed to use weapons within limitations considered reasonably necessary depending on the incident,
provided that they have adequate and legitimate reasons to believe that they have no other means but to use
weapons to stop the boat. This use of weapons will be considered to be a lawful act even when it results in
injury to the crew of the boat.

**(3) Enhancing Equipments for Responding to Unidentified Vessels**
The MSDF took the following actions: 1) increased the speed of new-type missile crafts[49]; 2) newly organized a
special boarding unit[50]; 3) equipped destroyers with machine guns; 4) furnished forcible maritime interdiction
equipment (flat-nose shells)[51]; and 5) improved the fill rate of necessary ship crews.

**(4) Measures for Strengthening Cooperation with the Japan Coast Guard**
**a. Developing the Framework for Strengthening Cooperation**
In 1999, the Defense Agency (then) and the Japan Coast Guard jointly developed the Manual on Joint
Strategies concerning Unidentified Vessels, and provided the liaison system, procedure for initial response,
division of roles (joint response procedure), and other around the time of an order for maritime security
operations.


-----

**b. Joint Exercises with the Japan Coast Guard**
The Ministry of Defense and the Japan Coast Guard conduct periodical mutual learning sessions, information
exchange and joint exercises. Also, according to the manual, the MSDF conducts joint exercises with the Japan
Coast Guard, regarding communications and the procedures to trace and capture unidentified vessels in order to
strengthen their cooperation.
On March 12 this year, a joint field exercise was conducted in the off shore of Sasebo. (See Chapter 4,
Section 1)

**5. Response to Large-Scale and Special-Type Disasters**
The SDF conducts a variety of disaster relief activities
when such a disaster occurs, including search and
rescue for accident victims and ships or aircraft in
distress, flood control, medical treatment, epidemic
prevention, water supply, and transportation of
personnel and goods. The expectations of the Japanese
people toward SDF disaster relief operations has been
increasing considerably, particularly after SDF units
were dispatched for the Great Hanshin-Awaji
Earthquake[52] in 1995. In subsequent years, the SDF
also played major roles in responding not only to
natural disasters but also to various other disasters, residents in Satsuma-cho, Kagoshima

GSDF’s 12th Infantry regiment (Kagoshima prefecture) rescuing isolated

such as the nuclear criticality accident in 1999 in Tokaimura, Ibaraki Prefecture, and the accidental sinking of
the training boat, Ehime Maru of the Ehime Prefectural Uwajima Fisheries High School in 2001.

**1. Mechanism of Disaster Relief Dispatches**

**(1) Types of Disaster Relief Dispatches**
**a. Disaster Relief Dispatch**
(a) Dispatches upon Request (General form of disaster relief dispatch)
In principle, the SDF dispatches its units for disaster relief upon request of prefectural governors and other
officials under Article 83 of the Self-Defense Forces Law. This is because prefectural governors and other
officials assume primary responsibility for disaster control measures, and are in the position to grasp the overall
condition of the disaster, and therefore it is considered most appropriate for such dispatches to be made upon
request by them. Also, when a disaster has occurred or is expected to occur soon, and when it is deemed
necessary to take emergency measures, mayors of municipalities can ask the governors to request disaster relief
dispatches by the SDF. Furthermore, when the mayors are not able to make such a request to the governors,
they can inform the condition of the disaster to the Minister of Defense or those designated by the Minister, in
accordance with Article 68-1 of the Disaster Countermeasures Basic Act.

(b) Discretionary Dispatch
The Minister of Defense or those designated by the Minister may dispatch SDF units without a request, in
exceptional circumstances when the situations are particularly urgent, and there is no time to wait for a request.
In order to render these discretionary dispatches even more effective, the Defense Agency Disaster
Prevention Plan (then)[53] was revised in 1995 to specify that SDF unit commanders or other officials may order
discretionary dispatches in following cases:


-----

1) when information gathering is necessary in order to provide the information to concerned organizations;
2) when urgent relief measures are required, but the prefectural governors or other such officials are deemed
unable to make a request for relief dispatch; and
3) when such relief dispatches are required to save lives.
In addition, SDF unit commanders are authorized to dispatch units, when a fire or other disaster occurred in
or near the facilities of the Ministry of Defense.

**b. Earthquake Disaster Prevention Dispatch**
When an alert[54] is issued based on the Law Concerning Special Measures for Large-Scale Earthquakes
Countermeasures, the Minister of Defense is authorized to order an earthquake disaster prevention dispatch
upon the request of the Director of the Earthquake Disaster Warning Headquarters (the Prime Minister), even
prior to the occurrence of the earthquake.

**c. Nuclear Disaster Dispatch**
When a nuclear emergency alert is issued based on the Special Law on Nuclear Disasters Countermeasures, the
Minister of Defense is authorized to order a nuclear disaster dispatch upon the request of the Director of the
Nuclear Disaster Countermeasures Headquarters (the Prime Minister).

**(3) Authority of Self-Defense Force Officers in Disaster Relief Dispatches**
The Self-Defense Forces Law and other legislations provide SDF personnel ordered for a disaster relief
dispatch, earthquake disaster prevention dispatch or nuclear disaster dispatch with the authority shown in
Figure III-1-2-14 in order to allow them to effectively conduct disaster relief activities.

**Fig. III-1-2-14 Authority of Self-Defense Forces Officers in Disaster Relief Dispatches**

1. SDF officers may issue necessary warnings to people in the vicinity, and in extremely imminent situation, may by themselves, or ask
people concerned to take measures that are deemed generally necessary to hold or to evacuate people who may be in danger at the site in
order to avoid harm, provided that no police officers are on the scene.

2. Where danger is imminent, SDF officers may trespass into private land or buildings, if they deem it reasonably necessary under the
circumstances, in order to protect people’s lives or property from harm, prevent greater damage and to rescue victims, provided that no
police officers are on the scene.

3. SDF Officer may remove unattended vehicles from streets in order to secure passage of emergency SDF vehicles, provided that no police
officers are on the scene, in areas to which access of vehicles other than emergency ones is prohibited or limited (excluding earthquake
disaster prevention dispatches).

4. SDF officers may take the following additional actions, provided that neither the mayor of the city, town or village involved, nor police
officers nor Japan Coast Guard Officials authorized under his or her proxy are on the scene (excluding earthquake disaster prevention
dispatches):
(1) Set up a warning zone where there is a high risk of the collapse of buildings, landslides or other such occurrences, and issuing orders
to restrict or prohibit entry or to evacuate people;
(2) Use land and buildings to secure bases for relief operations and communication relay stations required for the airlifting of emergency
patients;
(3) Move or clear away buildings or other structures standing in the way, in order to, for example, rescue people trapped in collapsing
houses; or
(4) Have residents or people on hand engage in rescue, flood prevention and other activities, when there are insufficient SDF personnel on
the scene.
(See Article 94, 94-3, and 94-4 of the Self-Defense Forces Law as well as the Disaster Countermeasures Basic Law.)


**2. Initial Operations Postures and Implementation Status of Disaster Relief Dispatches**

**(1) Initial Responses to the Disaster**
Based on lessons learned from the Great Hanshin-Awaji Earthquake, the ASDF, GSDF and MSDF have
assigned designated units to take immediate initial actions to ensure prompt disaster relief dispatches. As of
May this year, the GSDF designated approximately 2,700 persons, 410 vehicles, and 30 helicopters throughout
the country as units that can be immediately dispatched for disaster relief activities. The MSDF keeps
designated vessels in each base to be available for emergency operations, and is prepared with a standby
system for aircraft. The ASDF is prepared with a standby system for aircraft.
The SDF has established a system to dispatch aircraft on a discretionary basis in order to gather
information and communicate it to the Prime Minister and the Cabinet when its units are informed of the
occurrence of an earthquake of level 5-weak on the Japanese seismic scale. Also, depending on the situation,
the SDF will dispatch liaison officers to concerned local governments for information gathering.
Life-saving activities can also be conducted, using equipments of the ASDF, GSDF and MSDF.
The ASDF has newly formed an aeromedical evacuation squadron in October 2006 in the process of
developing a system for transporting patients in a serious condition to a distant location for providing adequate
treatment without delay in a event of large-scale disasters.


-----

**(2) Implementation Status of Disaster Dispatches**
**a. Transporting Emergency Patients**

Conventionally, the SDF has been using its aircraft to
transport emergency patients living on isolated islands
where medical facilities are not sufficiently available.
In FY 2006, 579 out of the total of 812 disaster relief
dispatches were for transporting emergency patients,
and 543 were for southwest islands (Okinawa and
Kagoshima prefectures) and Goto islands (Nagasaki
prefecture) to mark a high number.
The breakdown information shows that elderly
emergency patient was the most common case for such
transport, and there were some childbirth and

ASDF’s Chitose Rescue unit (Hokkaido) transporting an emergency patient from accidents. The SDF also transports emergency patients

ASDF’s Chitose Rescue unit (Hokkaido) transporting an emergency patient from

Rishiri island (Two persons on the left) on ships navigating in sea area far from the mainland,

when aircraft of other organizations are not available due to their short flight range.

**b. Firefighting Support**
In FY 2006, 117 cases of dispatches were for supporting firefighting activities, and this was the second highest
number following emergency transport of patients. Dispatches for proximity firefighting were the highest in
number with 104 cases in FY 2006. SDF units deployed throughout the country are actively involved in
proximity firefighting to contribute to ensuring the security of the livelihood of local residents.
For places where firefighting operations are difficult, such as islands and mountain areas, the SDF
conducted aerial firefighting activities upon the request of prefectural governors for disaster relief dispatches.

**COMMENTARY**

**Aeromedical Evacuation Squadron**

The Ministry of Defense and the Self-Defense Forces organized the Aeromedical Evacuation Squadron in
the Air Self-Defense Force Komaki Base in October last year to improve a system that enables severely
injured people to be transported promptly to a safe distant place for appropriate treatment at the time of a
large-scale disaster. The system is the one that the Ministry of Defense had been considering
indispensable from the lesson of the Hanshin-Awaji

Aeromedical transport

The specific mission of the squadron is to carry two
aeromedical transport compartments in the cargo area of
C-130H as well as a medical team consisting of a
medical officer, paramedic, nurse and supervisor
(transport coordinator), and transport the severely
injured to a distant medical institution and other Air conditioners electromagnetic proof wallsSoundproof and
facilities while first aid is given onboard if necessary. Movable beds

The squadron allows air medical services to be provided during disaster relief missions and the
transport of injured SDF personnel. This makes it possible to transport the severely injured over a long
distance while emergency stabilization medical treatment is given, making the treatment process seamless
from initial to final treatment.

**c. Response to Natural Disasters**
In FY 2006 Japan was hit by natural disasters including nationwide floods due to heavy rain in July 2006,
disrupted water supply resulted by rocks falling in water supply tunnel in Hiroshima, and the Noto Peninsula
Earthquake in March 2007. Major dispatches for such natural disasters were as follows:

(a) Disaster Dispatches for the Heavy Rain in July 2006
In late July 2006, the seasonal rain front brought concentrated heavy rain in Kyushu and Chubu regions, and
caused the destruction of river, floods and mud slides. A disaster dispatch was requested by individual
prefectural governors of Fukui, Nagano, Kyoto, Kagoshima, Miyazaki and Kumamoto, and approximately
2,600 (cumulative) persons, 450 vehicles and 50 aircraft were dispatched for searching missing people,
rescuing the victims of landslides, supporting the evacuation of isolated residents, taking preventive measures
for the destruction of banks (sandbagging banks), and transporting materials.

(b) Disaster Dispatch for Assisting Water Supply Work in Kure and Edajima in Hiroshima prefecture
On August 25, 2006, the rock bed in the prefectural water supply tunnel for Kaitacho, Akigun and Akiku,
Hiroshima in Hiroshima prefecture fell off, and water supply was disrupted in a wide area around Kure and
Edajima Cities. Upon the request by the governor of Hiroshima prefecture for a disaster dispatch,
approximately 6,790 persons (cumulative), 1,400 vehicles, 40 ships and 6 aircraft were dispatched for assisting
in water supply activities and bath services.

(c) Disaster Dispatches for the Earthquake in the Noto Peninsula in 2007
On March 25, 2007, an earthquake (M6.9) occurred with the epicenter at the off shore of the Noto Peninsula,
and caused damages including the destruction of houses, landslides, disruption of water supply, and others in a
wide area around Wajima. Kanazawa upon the request by the governor of Ishikawa prefecture, approximately
2,730 persons (cumulative), 1,050 vehicles, and 60 aircraft were dispatched for assisting in water supply
activities and food services.

**VOICE**

**Voice of SDF Personnel who Participated in the Relief Mission**
**to Support Water Supply in Kure and Etajima**

**Sergeant Hiroharu Matsui**
**The 13th Anti-tank Company, GSDF**

A duct used for supplying drinking and industrial water to
the Kure and Etajima cities collapsed in August last year,
and water supply was suspended in the region.
I had never participated in disaster relief missions since
I joined the Self-Defense Forces nine years before, but
after seeing the news about the accident on TV, I decided
to take part in the mission to supply water to the residents.
It was because I genuinely wanted to help the people in
trouble in the stricken area.
When we entered Kure City, children waved their

GSDF personnel supplying water on the reclaimed land of the

hands, men and women were rejoiced and welcomed us Kakiura Port in Etajima City, Hiroshoma Prefecture
with a clapping of hands, and there were even old women
who put their hands together and prayed to us. It was a very moving moment.
When we parked the vehicle in a parking lot, people had already been in a line for water. The vehicle
carried only one ton of water, so it was emptied almost instantly. We kept carrying water from the water
refilling point to water supply points every day, encouraged by smiles of and words of thanks expressed
by the residents who came to receive water.
We could complete the around-the-clock water supply mission thanks to the training we had regularly
received and the cooperation of the local people who helped us at the water refilling point. The one-week
disaster relief mission provided me with a precious opportunity to realize the importance of the ties
between people.

**Ensign Junji Nakashita**
**Kure Area Guard Group Support Unit, MSDF**

The Kure Area Guard Group stationed in Kure City,
Hiroshima Prefecture, took part in a disaster relief mission
in August last year upon request from the Hiroshima
Prefectural Government to supply water to Kure and
Etajima cities after water supply facilities for the cities
collapsed. I was assigned to carry water to Etajima City as
a commander for two fresh water tankers.
On the first day of the mission, we realized that fire
engine pumps were necessary to send water from the
tankers alongside a pier to a water purification plant The fresh water tankers of the Kure Area Guard alongside a pier to

supply water

located about 500 m away from the pier. We therefore
needed to work in cooperation with fire fighters, but because such joint work was for the first time for us
as well as for the fire fighters, we could supply only about 250 tons during six hours.


-----

From this lesson of the first day we realized the importance of detailed coordination, and on the
following day, coordinated activities with the fire fighters more effectively to obtain more hoses, higherperformance pumps, and other equipment. Thanks to these efforts, we could supply about 1,000 tons of
water from the two tankers. This gave us confidence to successfully continue with the mission, and,
considering the hardships experienced by the residents of Etajima City, everyone shared the same
determination to carry as much water as possible.
This mission provided us with a very precious opportunity to work with fire departments and
waterworks authorities, which are usually not associated with the MSDF, to help the people of Etajima
City.

**3. Efforts Made in Peace Time in Preparation for Disaster Relief**

**(1) Cooperation with Local Governments**
In order to conduct disaster relief activities promptly and appropriately, it is important for the SDF to
strengthen cooperation with local governments in peace time. For example, the SDF needs to enhance
communication systems, coordinate their disaster prevention plans with those of local governments, and
actively participate in disaster prevention exercises conducted by local governments.
In July 2006, a new function for communicating with local governments on disaster related matters was
added to provincial liaison offices in prefectures, and the post of the Civil Protection and Disaster Relief
Coordinator was newly established. Then, the name of the liaison office was changed to the Provincial
Cooperation Office. Through these efforts, the SDF is developing closer cooperation with local governments.
(See Chapter 4, Section 1)
Also, in view of the importance of cooperation with local governments in human resources, the SDF
recommends retired SDF personnel with particular experience in relevant fields to local governments on a
request basis in order to provide the knowledge and experience of SDF personnel for disaster prevention
activities of local governments. As of April 30, 2007, the number of retired SDF personnel serving as staff
responsible for disaster prevention is 126 persons in 43 prefectures and municipalities.
Also, current SDF personnel temporarily serve as staff in the Disaster Prevention Bureau of the Tokyo
Metropolitan Government. (See Fig. III-1-2-17)
Furthermore, while the collaboration with the SDF at the time of disaster occurrence is provided in the
regional disaster prevent plan made by prefectural governments, local governments should actively take the
following actions as this is important for the Ministry of Defense and the SDF to conduct disaster relief
activities effectively.

**a. Securing Assembly Areas**
Dispatched SDF units need an assembly area at the disaster site as a base for their activities to secure a
command post, lodging, parking, and accumulating necessary materials. Parks and play fields near the disaster
site are suitable for the assembly area. For example, a GSDF unit with the size of a regiment requires
approximately 15,000 m[2] (area about 1/3 of the Tokyo Dome), and a division will need over 140,000 m[2] (area
about 3 Tokyo Domes) to stay and conduct relief operations.

**b. Securing Heliports**
In the event of a disaster, it is likely that vehicle usage will be restricted, and therefore, setting up a heliport
within the devastated area or in its vicinity becomes necessary for transporting emergency patients and

materials, and conducting firefighting activities using helicopters. To ensure smooth landing and takeoff of
helicopters, it is necessary to clearly separate refuge areas from the heliports, and the locations of heliports and
refuge areas should be well-notified to local residents in advance in peace time. While required area for a
heliport varies depending upon the type of helicopters and activities, an area with 50 to 100 m on each side of
the square is necessary per a helicopter as rough measure.

**c. Displaying Building Numbers**
In order for aircraft to gather information and transport people and material efficiently, it is useful to have an
identification number displayed on the roof of important buildings for disaster prevention activities, such as
prefectural offices and schools, so that airplanes can easily acknowledge those buildings. Such identification
numbers enable the SDF to take actions for disaster relief dispatch quickly using aircraft because of easy
confirmation of buildings.

**d. Securing Facilities for Coordination and Communications**
It is also essential for prefectural governments to set up facilities in their offices for coordination and
communications with the SDF, including a temporary office for communications, a standby station for liaison
officers and parking facilities. In addition, it is necessary to develop a disaster prevention map indicating the
locations of refuge areas and heliports for common use among various disaster prevention agencies.
Furthermore, fire extinguishing materials should be prepared for aerial firefighting activities by helicopters,
and arrangement should be made in peace time for securing reservoirs such as cisterns.

**(2) Development of a Response Manual for Various Disasters**
In order to respond more promptly and appropriately to disasters appeared in various forms, it is effective to
clarify the basic measures and to make all concerned parties aware of them. To this end, based on lessons
learned from past disaster relief dispatches and disaster prevention exercises, the then Defense Agency and the
SDF developed a response manual for various types of disasters in November 2000, which lists issues to be
noted for each type of disasters[55].
In this manual, expected disasters are classified into four types: 1) disasters in urban areas, 2) disasters in
hilly and mountainous areas, 3) disasters on islands, and 4) special-type disasters. For each type, the manual
defines a response plan, conditions of possible damages, essential activities required, and issues to be noted.
The manual has already been distributed to related agencies and local governments. The ASDF, GSDF and
MSDF are making efforts to improve their disaster relief activities based on the Defense Ministry Disaster
Prevention Plan and this manual.

**(3) Response to Nuclear Disasters**
Based on lessons learned from the criticality accident that occurred at a uranium-processing plant in
Tokaimura, Ibaraki Prefecture in 1999, the Special Law on Nuclear Disasters Countermeasures was enacted in
the same year in order to significantly strengthen response measures for nuclear disaster. The law provides that
the Director of the Nuclear Disaster Countermeasures Headquarters (the Prime Minister) may request the
Minister of State for Defense (then) to provide SDF assistance in order to appropriately and promptly take
emergency response measures, and this resulted a partial amendment to the Self-Defense Forces Law[56].
After the critical nuclear accident in Tokaimura, the GSDF, ASDF and MSDF have been providing
transport support, assistance for evacuating residents, and monitoring airborne and seaborne radiation levels in
the comprehensive nuclear disaster prevention exercise, which has been carried out since 2000 under the
initiative of the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, and confirming the procedures for cooperating with
other ministries and local governments in nuclear disasters.

**VOICE**

**Voice of SDF Personnel who Participated in the Relief Mission**
**for the Rainstorm Disaster in the Hokuriku Region**

**Staff Sergeant Hirokazu Osada**
**The 35th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron,**
**Middle Aircraft Control and Warning Wing ASDF**

The intense rainstorm hit the Sea of Japan side of the
country in July last year, and a large-scale landslide
destroyed a house and buried two people alive. Since
there had been a cemetery on the fallen slope of the
mountain, the site was covered with the large volume
of earth and many tombstones. Furthermore, the soil
was clayey and soaked with a large amount of
rainwater, and we even did not know where in the
house the two people had been at the time when the
landslide had occurred. All these conditions made the
relief mission extremely difficult.
The 35th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron Staff Sergeant Osada (far right) engaged in rescue operations
to which I belong was dispatched to the site upon
request from the Governor of Kyoto prefecture. The three squads were formed with each consisting of
about 45 members, and began to search the two people as soon as they arrived at the site. We collected
and shared information promptly, and looked for the two people in a tense atmosphere we had never
experienced before, under the command of the mission commander at the site.
I did not feel any anxiety. All I had in mind was the determination to save them as soon as possible.
We removed broken pieces of the house one by one almost manually, and a while later, finally found the
two people in a gap under the collapsed house. I was involved in all the rescue work to bring them safe out
of the gap, and could successfully end my first field mission.
This disaster relief mission provided me with a precious opportunity to recognize anew the role of
SDF personnel to protect life and property of the people and thereby meet their trust, as well as the
importance of being well aware of the role.
My squadron is responsible for surveillance over the Sea of Japan side of the country using air defense
radars. Our major mission is to monitor aerial invasion around the clock by watching the screen of a radar
system, and different from disaster relief missions in terms of activities involved. However, although the
activities are different, I think that the mission of the squadron and disaster relief missions share the same
purpose to protect Japan. I like running a marathon and muscle strengthening, and have always trying to
maintain mental and physical strength through those exercises. But from the disaster relief mission I
realized that the most important thing for each member to complete their missions—both aerial invasion
surveillance and disaster rescues—is not just to keep up mental and physical strength of each member but
also to be well aware of the importance of their role in protecting Japan.
The experiences of the disaster relief mission gave me confidence that I can challenge even the most
difficult missions in the future. I continue to work hard in training with the lessons from the disaster relief
mission in mind so that I can promptly perform various missions.

The enhancement of the chemical protection units has been included in the budget for FY 2007 to allow
response to nuclear disasters[57] as well as to special-type disasters.

**6. Response to Other Events**

**1. Improvement in Guard Postures for SDF Facilities**
While the police agency has the primary responsibility in dealing with the incidents of terrorism, the SelfDefense Forces Law was amended to allow SDF units to be called upon to guard the facilities and sites of the
SDF and the USFJ, and to use weapons as necessary in regular guarding missions for SDF facilities, in order to
improve preparedness for large-scale terrorist attacks like those in the United States that occurred on
September 11, 2001.

**(1) Operations for Guarding SDF Facilities (Guarding Operations)**
When there is a possibility of large-scale terrorist attacks on the facilities and sites of the SDF and USFJ within
Japan and the needs for preventing damage to these facilities are recognized, the Prime Minister may order
SDF units to conduct operations to guard the facilities and sites of the SDF and USFJ. Part of the authorities
given to the police officials under the Law Concerning the Execution of Duties of Police Officials may be
given to the SDF personnel ordered to carry out guarding operations[58]. Also, the amended Self-Defense Forces
Law provides that SDF personnel may be given the authority to use weapons beyond the limitations of Article
7 of this law. (See Fig. III-1-2-18)

period.

- Limited to cases where no police officers are present


The Ministry of Defense and the SDF exchange opinions about guarding operations with the police and the
Japan Coast Guard in order to ensure the effectiveness of guarding operations, which are new duties for the
SDF. In addition, exercises for guarding operations have been conducted at USFJ facilities and sites throughout
Japan since 2003.

**(2) Use of Weapons to Guard SDF Facilities in Normal Circumstances**
The amended Self-Defense Forces Law gives SDF personnel the authority to use weapons as necessary in order
to guard SDF facilities on duty within Japan that have installations for storing, accommodating or maintaining
weapons, ammunition, explosives, vessels, aircraft, vehicles, wired electronic communication equipments,


-----

radio equipments, or liquid fuel, and those that have accommodations and installations related to quarters, ports
or airports[59].

**2. Preparing for Transporting Expatriates of Japanese Nationality**

**(1) Amendment of the Self-Defense Forces Law**
When disasters, riots or other emergencies occurred overseas, the Ministry of Defense and the SDF transported,
with the government’s aircraft or the ASDF’s transport aircraft, expatriate Japanese nationals who need
protection for their lives and bodies upon the request of the Minister of Foreign Affairs under Article 100-8 of
the Self-Defense Forces Law (then).
In 1999 the amendment was made to the SelfDefense Forces Law to add SDF ships and the
helicopters on board as a means to transport expatiates
of Japanese nationality. Also, SDF personnel are
authorized to use minimum amount of weapons
necessary to protect the lives and bodies of SDF
personnel and Japanese nationals. Thus, the
preparedness for transporting the Japanese expatriates
has been enhanced. Today many Japanese nationals
are visiting and staying overseas, and transporting
such Japanese nationals in the event of conflicts in ASDF personnel exercising for non-combatant evacuation
overseas has become an important activity for the
security of citizens. As the Defense Agency was promoted to the Ministry of Defense in January 2007, such
transporting operations was redefined as a primary mission in Article 84-3 of the Self-Defense Forces Law,
which was previously a secondary task, and the authority in such operations was provided in Article 94-5 in the
same law. (See Part II, Chapter 3, Section 2)

**(2) Postures of the ASDF, GSDF and MSDF**
In order to receive Japanese nationals from overseas legations and safely transport them to local airports and
harbors, the GSDF maintains designated dispatch personnel for helicopter units and guidance units[60], while the
MSDF keeps designated transport ships and air units, and the ASDF maintains designated air carrier units.
Missions to transport expatriated Japanese nationals are carried out in close cooperation between the
ASDF, GSDF and MSDF, and therefore an integrated coordination is required. To meet this requirement, they
have improved their capability to fulfill such missions through integrated exercises using transport aircraft and
ships.

**(3) Actual Experience in Transporting Expatriated Japanese Nationals**
On April 15, 2004, 10 Japanese journalists stayed in Samawah, Iraq, to report the activities of the GSDF
dispatched under the Law Concerning Special Measures on Humanitarian and Reconstruction Assistance in
Iraq were transported from Talil Airport in Iraq to Mubarak Air Force Base in Kuwait by a C-130H
transportation aircraft as the first transport of Japanese nationals under Article 84-3 (Article 100-8 then) of the
Self-Defense Forces Law.

**3. Response to Situations in Areas Surrounding Japan**
The National Defense Program Guidelines states that the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements shall be


-----

strengthened by actively promoting measures such as various operational cooperation efforts, including
cooperation in the situations in areas surrounding Japan.
Prior to the transition to a ministry in January 2007, the Ministry of Defense and the SDF provided supplies
and services as rear area support stipulated in the Law Concerning Measures to Ensure the Peace and Security
of Japan and the Ship Inspection Operations Law, and were involved in rear area search and rescue activities
and ship inspection operations to the extent such activities do not hinder the execution of the SDF’s tasks based
on Article 100-9 of the Self-Defense Forces Law.
Responses to the situations in areas surrounding Japan significantly affect the peace and security of Japan.
In order to ensure peace and security in Japan, the positioning of such tasks was reviewed and changed from a
secondary task to a primary task upon the shift from an agency to an ministry in January 2007, and provided in
Article 84-4 in the Self-Defense Forces Law. (See Part II, Chapter 3, Section 2)

**4. Collecting Military Information**
While security issues are becoming more diversified and complex, and effective preparation for new threats
and diversified situations has become an urgent issue, it has become necessary more than ever before to detect
any indication of contingencies at the earliest possible timing, and gather, analyze and share information
promptly and appropriately for the purpose of responding adequately to such situations. And, in the view of
national security of Japan, broader scope and comprehensive intelligence capabilities are now required.
Therefore, the Ministry of Defense and the SDF analyze and assess a variety of information
comprehensively, and have diversified the means of collecting information. The activities of information
collection include: 1) collecting, processing and analyzing radio waves concerning military communications
and radio waves emitted from electronic weapons bound for Japan from abroad; 2) collecting and analyzing
high-resolution commercial satellite imagery data; 3) warning and surveillance by ships and aircraft; 4)
collecting and organizing variety of published information; 5) exchanging information with defense authorities
of other nations; and 6) intelligence activities[61] by defense attachés[62].
In order to enhance the capabilities of collecting a variety of information, and comprehensively analyzing
and assessing information with consideration the security environment and technical trends, the Ministry of
Defense/the SDF will improve equipments and devices for information gathering, and also will enhance the
intelligence system, including the Defense Intelligence Headquarters, which supports such capabilities.

**[COLUMN]**


**VOICE**


**Voice of an SDF Officer Working as the Defense Attaché in Belgium**

**Colonel Jun Nagashima, ASDF**
**Defense Attaché**

The Kingdom of Belgium is a small country with
an area of less than 30,000 km[2] (about 1.5 times as
large as Shikoku Island), but because the country is
situated at the center of Europe, it was considered a
point of strategic importance and ruled by the
surrounding countries until it finally won
independence in 1830. Brussels, the capital of the
country, is known as the city where EU and NATO
headquarters are located, and the number of
diplomats based in this city, including those
working for embassies and international
organizations, is said to be the largest in the world. Colonel Nagashima at the North Atlantic Council meeting held in Brussels onFebruary 12, 2007 (left in the back row)
The city has thus established the position as the
center of European politics and security.
Because of these characteristics of Belgium, the most important mission of the Defense Attaché in the
country is to collect and analyze information on, not only Belgium in bilateral terms, but also on NATO,
which is the backbone of European security, EU and other international organizations located in the
country. In Europe, while threats of full-scale armed invasion have disappeared, regional conflicts
international terrorism, proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) and other new threats have
become important new security issues, and the scope of military activities has been expanding rapidly to
deal with those issues. NATO, for example, has sent a force of about 52,300 soldiers to Afghanistan,
Kosovo, Darfur and other locations spanning three continents for the purposes of reconstruction
assistance, preservation of public order, and training for security forces.
In the meantime, Japan is also involved in many international peace cooperation activities, and the
operations of the Self-Defense Forces are attracting great attention in Europe. As the Japan Defense
Agency has been upgraded to a ministry, and overseas activities have become a primary mission of the
SDF, Japan and Europe can cooperate beyond the geographical boundaries for global peace in the
increasing number of areas in the future. However, the interest of European countries in the Asian region
in terms of security is still low in comparison with their interest in Asian economy, and it is indispensable
for Japan and Europe to correctly understand their respective circumstances and defense policy to further
enhance security cooperation. To this end, in addition to comprehensively collecting and analyzing
information on Belgium as a provider of force to NATO and EU, as well as on NATO and EU themselves,
I, as the Defense Attaché working in Brussels, am explaining the security environment and defense policy
of Japan and the activities of the SDF at every opportunity—from such contact occasions as receptions
with military officers or representatives of other countries to more personal family-to-family
communication—and exploring specific ways Japan and Europe can cooperate in terms of security. It is
my firm belief that all these steady efforts in this country in the regular operations of the Defense Attaché
will have a cumulative effect in ultimately bringing about the stability and prosperity of the distant East
Asia region.

Section 3. Preparation against Full-Scale Aggression

Since the possibility of full-scale aggression to Japan in the foreseeable future is seemed to be decreasing, the
National Defense Program Guidelines indicates the shift from so-called Cold-War type defense build-up
concept and to reduce equipments and persons prepared for full-scale aggression. However, the most basic part
will be maintained with consideration of the fact that the original role of the defense force is to respond to fullscale aggression and such force cannot be build up in a short period of time. Even today, unclear and uncertain
factors remain in areas surrounding Japan. Considering the devastating loss of people’s lives and properties that
armed aggression could cause, readiness for full-scale aggression is essential.
In the event of full-scale aggression to Japan, the GSDF, ASDF and MSDF will respond promptly and
effectively by acting in an organized and integrated manner in the joint operations posture. Operations to be
employed for full-scale aggression are classified as follows by function: 1) operations for air defense, 2)
operations for guarding waters surrounding Japan, 3) operations for guarding the territory of Japan, and 4)
operations for securing safety of maritime transportation. In conducting such operations, the U.S. forces will
support the operations employed by the SDF in accordance with the Guidelines for Japan-U.S. Defense
Cooperation, and conduct operations to complement the capability of the SDF, which may include operations
with striking force.
This section will explain the outline of typical operations that may be conducted by the SDF to defend the
nation when a full-scale aggression took place. (See Chapter 2, Section 3)

**1. Air Defense Operations**

In the event of armed attacks on Japan, such attacks
are likely to begin with surprise air attacks using
aircraft and missiles, and the air attacks will be
repeated because of the geographical characteristics of
Japan, which is surrounded by waters, and because of
the trends of modern warfare[63].
Operations for air defense are characterized by the
invading party having an advantage in choosing the
time, locations, and methods for attack, and that the
adequateness of initial response has a significant

ASDF’s F-15 fighter on duty impact on over all operations. Therefore, it is

necessary to maintain a prompt response posture in
peace time, collect relevant information continuously, and exhibit combat power promptly and
comprehensively from the initial stage of the operations.
Operations for air defense can be divided into overall operations led by the ASDF, and local air defense
operations conducted by the GSDF, MSDF, and ASDF, in defending their respective bases and units.
In overall air defense, efforts will be made to cope promptly with the aerial intrusion by enemy aircraft in
order to intercept them in airspace as distant from Japanese territory as possible to keep them from gaining air
superiority[64], prevent damage to the people as well as the national land, and inflict heavy damage on the enemy.
Thus, the SDF endeavors to impede the enemy’s efforts to continue serial assaults. (See Fig. III-1-3-1)

**(1) Detecting Intruding Enemy Aircraft**
Using the radars of the air warning and control units as well as early warning and control aircraft, the entire
airspace of areas surrounding Japan shall be kept under surveillance, and intruding enemy aircraft shall be
detected as quickly as possible.

2. Keeping armed fighters standing-by to be able to immediately respond to the approach by enemy aircraft.

Using the Base Air Defense Ground Environment (BADGE)[65] System, detected aircraft shall be identified as
friend or enemy.

**(3) Interception and Destruction of the Enemy’s Aircraft**
When the detected aircraft are deemed to be enemies, the air warning and control organization assigns
destruction targets to fighters standing by on the ground or in the air as well as to the surface-to-air guided units
of the GSDF or ASDF, and the controlled and guided fighters and surface-to-air guided missiles will destroy
the enemy aircraft.

**2. Operations for the Defense of Surrounding Sea Areas**
Armed attacks on Japan can be made by vessels as well as by aircraft due to Japan’s nature as an island nation.
Operations for defending the sea areas surrounding Japan will be led by the MSDF in cooperation with the
GSDF and the ASDF, and execute various strategies in combination, including anti-surface ships, antisubmarines, and air defense warfare (local). The cumulative effect of these strategies will make it possible to
successfully defend the surrounding sea areas, by obstructing the advance of enemy forces and reducing their
military strength. (See Fig. III-1-3-2)

**(1) Defense on the Sea**
In the surrounding sea areas, the MSDF patrols[66] vast sea areas using patrol aircraft and navigation areas using
destroyers. In the event that a surface ship or submarine of enemies is found to be attacking Japanese ships or
other vessels, the MSDF will attack the enemy using its
destroyers, submarines and patrol aircraft (anti-surface ship and
anti-submarine operations). As the situation requires, the MSDF
will receive support from fighters.


**(2) Defense in Coastal Areas**
Using its destroyers, patrol aircraft, and minesweepers, the MSDF
patrols the main ports and harbors for the early detection of enemy
attacks and ensure the safety of ships and coastal areas.
In the event of attacks by enemy’s surface ships and
submarines, the MSDF will destroy these ships and submarines
using destroyers, submarines and patrol aircraft (anti-surface ship
and anti-submarine operations). The MSDF receives support from
the fighters and GSDF’s surface-to-ship guided missile units when
the situation requires. When the enemy places mines, the MSDF
will remove them, using minesweepers (anti-mine operations).

-----

**(3) Defense in Main Straits**
When the situation requires, mines will be laid in main sea areas using minesweeping mother ships,
submarines, and aircraft of the MSDF and ASDF (mine-laying operations). When enemy’s surface vessels and
submarines attempt to pass the sea areas, the MSDF will destroy them using its destroyers, submarines, and
patrol aircraft (anti-surface ship and anti-submarine operations).

**(4) Air-Defense in the Surrounding Waters**
Air-defense for ships in water surrounding Japan will be performed by destroyers, and will receive support
from fighters as necessary.

**3. Operations for Defending Japan’s Territory (Response to Landing of Invading Forces)**
When a country attempts invade Japan’s territory, the
enemy’s force first acquires air and sea superiority on
invading fronts, and then land its troops on Japan’s
territory by ship or aircraft, Japan being an island
country.
Invading ground troops will be unable to exert full
fighting capability during sea or air maneuvers and
will be vulnerable and incapable of exerting their full
organized fighting capability immediately before or
after landing. Taking advantage of such operational
weakness, the operations to respond to the invading GSDF’s type-90 tanker in firing
forces need to counter and destroy the enemy troops at
as early a stage as possible between the sea and coast, as well as at landing sites. (See Fig. III-1-3-3)

**(1) Defense in Nearshore Waters**
The ASDF, GSDF and MSDF will make efforts to destroy as many enemy ships transporting ground troops as
possible at sea, using destroyers, submarines, patrol aircraft, fighters, and surface-to-ship guided missiles, to
force the enemy to abandon its intention of landing, or to reduce its strength.
Also, the fighters and surface-to-air guided missiles of the ASDF and GSDF will make efforts to destroy as
many enemy aircraft transporting ground troops as possible in the air.

**(2) Defense in Coastal Areas**
The MSDF, using minesweeping mother ships, will lay sea mines, and the GSDF, using coastal mine-laying
equipment, will lay coastal mines to obstruct and counter the landing of invading forces.
Against the troops that attempt to make landing, the GSDF will play the primary role in preventing the
landing of enemy ground troops in coastal areas by concentrating the use of tanks, antitank and special artillery
of the units[67] deployed on and around beaches. When enemy troops have already started landing, the GSDF will
hinder and destroy the invading troops using mobile striking power mainly supplied by special artillery, and
anti-tank guided missiles and tanks. During these operations, the ASDF will support the GSDF using fighters.
Airborne assaults[68] and helicopter borne assaults[69] made by the enemy in combination with the landing of
the ground troops will be repelled in early stage, mainly using special artillery and the mobile striking power.
The GSDF units conduct air defense (local) using to-air firepower such as surface-to-air guided missiles.

When the SDF fails to destroy enemy troops before or immediately after their landing, the units will deploy in
advance blocking of the advancement of the enemy with support of fighters (holding actions). In the meantime,
as many units as possible will be gathered from other areas to launch counter attacks to eliminate the invading
ground troops.

**(4) Countermeasures to be Implemented throughout the Stages of Operations**
Throughout the stages of these operations, the MSDF, using destroyers, submarines, and patrol aircraft, and the
ASDF, using fighters, will make efforts to block the enemy’s surface transportation for adding ground troops
and to shut down maritime logistical support lines.
In addition, the GSDF, MSDF and ASDF will conduct the necessary air defense, information collection,
transporting units and supplies throughout the overall operations to counter landing of invading forces.

**4. Operations for Ensuring the Safety of Maritime Traffic**
Maritime traffic is indispensable for Japan, and operations for ensuring the safety of maritime traffic is
important not only for sustaining the country’s fighting capability and ensuring Japan’s foundation for survival,
but also for enabling U.S. forces to come to support the SDF.
The MSDF ensures the safety of maritime traffic through patrol, escorting ships, and preparing straits and
harbors for defense operations by combining various operations such as anti-surface ship operations, anti

-----

submarine operations, air defense (local) and minesweeping operations in the waters to the distance of several
hundreds miles surrounding Japan, or in waters of approximately 1,000 nautical miles in the case of
establishing sea lanes[70].
Operations conducted in waters surrounding Japan will be almost the same as those for defending the
waters surrounding Japan as described before.
When a sea lane is established in preparation for operation, the sea lane will be patrolled continuously and
interference by enemies’ surface vessels and submarines will be detected and responded to quickly. In addition,
Japan’s ships will be escorted as necessary.
Destroyers will be used for air defense of Japanese ships in maritime traffic with the support of fighters as
necessary within the possible range.

enhancement of detection devices; human resources development; reinforcement of the informationgathering structure; enhancement of the medical structure such as construction of hospital rooms for
infectious diseases; establishment of the emergency response structure; implementation of exercises;
coordination with relevant organizations and information disclosure; and public relations.
2) The Establishment of a structure to cope with biological weapons is an important matter that the
Japanese government as whole should be tackled. The safety of the people is expected to be ensured by
having the Defense Agency and the SDF take an initiative in this effort with understanding of the
whole Japanese government’s response.
See <http://www.mod.go.jp/j/delibe/seibutu/houkoku.html>
43) Including territorial waters and inland waters
44) Maritime security operations (formal name, Article 82 of the SDF Law), refer to actions to be taken at sea
by the SDF with the particular need of protecting the lives and properties of the people or keeping peace
and order. This requires approval of the Prime Minister.
45) Regarding Response to Foreign Submarines Navigating under Water in the Territorial Waters and Inland
Waters of Japan decided at the Security Council and the Cabinet meeting in December 1996
This Cabinet decision has opened the way for SDF units to promptly demand any submarine navigating
under water in the territorial waters and inland waters of Japan to appear above water, raise the national
flag, and deport, according to the judgment of the Prime Minister by having decided the basic policy and
procedure at a Cabinet meeting in advance so that a Cabinet decision is not required in each occurrence of
such an incident.
46) An SDF patrol aircraft (P-3C) in a surveillance operation found two unidentified vessels suspected to be
North Korean spy ships disguised as Japanese fishing boats in Japanese territorial waters, east of the Noto
Peninsula and west of Sadogashima Island. Patrol vessels, destroyers, and aircraft pursued the vessels

around the clock, but the two vessels fled to outside the air defense identification zones (ADIZ) and were
supposed to reach a port in the northern part of North Korea.
47) An SDF patrol aircraft (P-3C) in a surveillance operation found an unidentified vessel, and tracked and
monitored it with patrol vessels and aircraft. The boat did not stop despite the repeated orders given by
the Japan Coast Guard. Therefore, the JCG fired warning shots after alerting the boat. The boat, however,
continued to run away and made armed attacks on the patrol ship, and the patrol ship fired self-defense
shots. The boat subsequently exploded for possible self-destruction and submerged. Based on the facts
revealed in the process of investigation, the boat was identified as a North Korean spy ship. Also in 2002,
a patrol aircraft (P-3C) in a surveillance operation found an unidentified vessel about 400 km northnorthwest off the Noto Peninsula (Beyond the exclusive economic waters of Japan), and patrol vessels of
Japan Coast Guard, destroyers, and aircraft tracked and surveiled the boat.
48) 1) The vessel in question appears to be of foreign nationality (excluding military vessels and those owned
or operated by foreign governments exclusively for noncommercial purpose) and is recognized to be
currently engaged in navigation other than innocent passage in the inland or territorial waters of Japan in
pursuant to Article 19 of the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea (excluding the cases in which such
navigation is justified for a certain reason); 2) Such navigation, if neglected, will probably lead to similar
activities in the future; 3) Such navigation is undeniably suspected to be preparation for the committing of
serious, violent crimes on Japanese territory; 4) Future serious, violent crimes cannot be prevented unless
appropriate actions are taken based on information obtained through the on-site inspection of the halted
boat.
49) In March 2002, two vessels were commissioned with the following major upgrades: 1) speed was
enhanced to approximately 44 knots from 40 knots; 2) they were equipped with a 12.7mm machine guns,
3) bullet proof features were installed on the bridge; and 4) they were equipped with night vision devices.
50) A special unit of the MSDF newly established in March 2001 to deter expected resistance and to disarm
and immobilize unidentified vessels in case of conducting on-board inspection under maritime security
operations.
51) Non-bursting shell shot launched from 76mm artillery equipped on destroyers, and the flat front edge of
the shell prevents scattering.
52) An earthquake of M7.3 with its epicenter in the southern part of Hyogo Prefecture in 1995 caused
devastating damage, including over 6,400 deaths and missed in the Hanshin region.
53) The Defense Ministry Disaster Prevention Plan
See <http://www.mod.go.jp/j/library/archives/keikaku/bousai/index.html>
54) The Prime Minister issues an alert concerning the earthquake with the endorsement of the Cabinet, when
the prediction of earthquake is reported and when it is deemed necessary to urgently implement
earthquake disaster prevention emergency measures.
55) Manual for measures against disasters in urban areas; disasters in hilly and mountainous areas; disasters
on islands; and special disasters
See <http://www.mod.go.jp/j/library/archives/keikaku/bousai/sankou_01.pdf>
56) 1) SDF units can be dispatched to provide assistance upon the request of the Director of the Nuclear
Disaster Countermeasures Headquarters; 2) SDF personnel dispatched for nuclear disaster relief can
exercise necessary authorities; 3) Special units can be formed temporarily when necessary for nuclear
disaster relief dispatches; and 4) SDF Ready Reserve Personnel can be called up for service in the event
of nuclear disaster relief dispatches.
57) Special-type disasters may be caused by terrorism and armed attacks using the weapons of mass
destructions.

58) When no police officials are at the scene, and limited to such circumstances only, SDF personnel on duty
is authorized to make inquiries, take evacuation measures, and enter property, in addition to the
authorized duties of preventing and controlling crimes, and using weapons.
59) SDF personnel can use weapons to the extent judged as reasonably necessary in a given situation within
the facilities when they consider that such use of weapons is necessary for executing the duties or
protecting themselves or others. The use of weapons, however, shall not cause harm to other people,
except for cases falling under self-defense or acts of emergency evacuation.
60) Units temporarily organized to be dispatched along with transport units (SDF aircraft and ships) to guide
and protect overseas Japanese nationals on site.
61) As of the end of May 2007, 48 defense attaches (SDF personnel temporarily transferred from the Ministry
of Defense to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs) were dispatched to diplomatic establishments abroad in 37
locations. These attaches take advantage of their experience as SDF personnel and are engaged in
collecting military information through exchange with defense-related personnel of the country to which
they have been dispatched, as well as with military attaches of other nations.
62) In order to enhance Japan’s capabilities for gathering imagery intelligence, the third and the fourth
information-gathering satellite were launched on September 11, 2006 and February 24, 2007,
respectively.
63) In modern warfare, air operations are an important element to determine the victor and loser, and it is
critical to secure air superiority ahead of, or in parallel with, the superiority in ground and marine
operations.
64) A state in which various strategies can be executed without receiving damage from the opponent as
superiority is gained in air operations again the opponent’s air operations.
65) An automated air warning and control organization with a nationwide command and communication
system that delivers and processes commands and tracking information.
66) To systematically patrol particular regions with a purpose such as preventing surprise attacks from
enemies and collecting information.
67) Long-range and large-caliber howitzers and rockets are possessed and will be used to destroy or intercept
infantry, light armored vehicles, and facilities.
68) Assault units aboard transport aircraft. They will parachute to the ground near important terrain and be
engaged in assaults on the ground. These units are specially formed, equipped, and trained, and are able to
move quickly by air over long distances.
69) Assault units for attacks on the ground after being transported to the land near important terrain by
transport helicopters. Compared to the airborne assaults, helicopter-borne assault operations can be

Section 1. The Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements

The Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements based on the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty[1] are a pillar of the defense of
Japan. The Japan-U.S. alliance, based on the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements, constitutes a foundation that is
indispensable to the maintenance of peace and stability not only of Japan but also of the Asia-Pacific region. The
close Japan-U.S. partnership based on the Japan-U.S. alliance plays an important role in effectively responding
to many difficult security challenges in the world. Also the Japan-U.S. alliance is becoming increasingly
important in promoting the fundamental values shared by Japan and the United States, including basic human
rights, freedom, democracy, and the rule of law, in the international community. (See Fig. III-2-1-1)
This section explains today’s significance of the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements in terms of the security
of Japan.

Refer to <http://www.clearing.mod.go.jp/hakusho_data/2004/2004/colindex.html>

**1. The Significance of the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements**
Japan owes its prosperity and development since the end of World War II to the wisdom and hard work of its
people, and to the fact that Japan has taken all possible measures to ensure peace and security by conducting
defense efforts by itself and by ensuring the effective functioning of the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements
based on the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty. When restoring independence after the end of World War II, Japan
has decided to form an alliance with the United States and become a member of the Free World based on
freedom and democracy, as Japan’s security strategy. This decision led to the prosperity and development of
Japan since then.


-----

The international situation remains full of unpredictable and uncertain elements. A number of destabilizing
factors are also prevalent in the Asia-Pacific region, including armed antagonism in the Korean Peninsula, the
expansion and modernization of military capabilities by regional countries, and the proliferation of weapons of
mass destruction and ballistic missiles. In addition, as represented by the fight against terrorism since the 9/11
terrorist attacks in the United States, security issues have been increasingly globalized. In such environment,
the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements and cooperative relationship between Japan and the United States based
on such arrangements play the following roles in Japan’s defense and regional peace and stability as well as in
the improvement of the international security environment. Japan therefore needs to maintain and further
strengthen the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements on a continuous basis.

**1. Maintenance of Japan’s Security**
In today’s international community, any country intending to secure peace and independence must build a
watertight system of defense strong enough to cope with every contingency, ranging from various types of
armed attacks, including the use of nuclear weapons, to threats or intimidation backed up by military force. In
today’s globalized international community, however, it is impossible even for the United States, a superpower
in the world, to ensure its security alone. It is not therefore feasible for Japan to establish and maintain such a
defense posture by itself, in view of its population, land, and economy. Also, it would not be an appropriate
political stance for Japan to take and would not necessarily contribute to regional stability.
Therefore, Japan has maintained the alliance with the U.S., which possesses immense military power,
shares with Japan the basic values of ideals of democracy, respect for freedom and human rights, and interests
in the maintenance of peace and security in the world, has strong economic ties with Japan, and is widely
accepted in the Asia-Pacific region. Japan believes that it can build a watertight defense posture to ensure its
security by effectively using the deterrent potential realized by the immense military power of the United States
and by maintaining an appropriate level of defense forces.
Article 5 of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty provides that Japan and the United States will take bilateral
actions in the event of an armed attack against Japan. The U.S. obligation to defend Japan means that any
country attempting an armed attack against Japan would have to contend not only with the SDF but also with
the overwhelming military power of the United States. This would surely make potential aggressors hesitate to
invade Japan, and therefore act as a deterrent to any such invasion. (See Reference 65)

**2. Maintenance of Peace and Stability in the Region Surrounding Japan**
Article 6 of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty provides that the United States is granted the use of facilities and
areas in Japan for the purpose of contributing to the security of Japan and the maintenance of international
peace and security in the Far East. This provision was made based on the recognition that the maintenance of
peace in the Far East is closely related to the maintenance of security of Japan. (See Reference 66)
The close relationship between Japan and the United States, based on the Japan-U.S. Security
Arrangements, including the presence of U.S. forces in Japan, forms a basis for securing the engagement of the
United States necessary for maintaining the peace and stability of the region surrounding Japan. Together with
alliances[2] and friendly relations between the United States and other countries of this region, the Japan-U.S.
alliance continues to play a key role in securing the peace and stability of the region in the post-Cold War era.

**3. Improvement of International Security Environment**
The Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements provide the foundation for comprehensive and overall Japan-U.S.
friendly and cooperative relations in a wide range of areas, including politics, economy, and society in addition
to defense. The Japan-U.S. partnership, based on the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements, constitutes a basis for


-----

Japan’s foreign policy and helps Japan play a positive role in maintaining the peace and stability of the
international community, including the promotion of multilateral security dialogues/cooperation and
contributions to U.N. activities.
The international community has been increasingly concerned about new threats and diverse contingencies,
such as international terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, since the 9/11 terrorist
attacks in the United States. Under these circumstances, the close partnership between Japan and the United
States is essentially important for the international community to effectively implement cooperative activities
to improve its security environment.
In particular, under the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements, the SDF and U.S. forces are making efforts to
improve coordination in various fields in normal times. This close coordination forms a basis for effective
cooperation between the SDF and U.S. forces.
The peace and prosperity of the international community is closely linked with Japan’s peace and
prosperity. Japan, therefore, can further ensure its peace and prosperity by cooperating with the United States,
which has excellent ability to conduct international activities, in implementing measures to improve the
international security environment.

**2. Presence of U.S. Forces in Japan**

**1. Significance of Presence of U.S. Forces in Japan (USFJ)**
The United States stations its forces in Japan based on the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty. In the Japan-U.S.
Security Treaty, Article 5 regulates the U.S. obligation to defend Japan, while on the other hand, Article 6
provides that the United States is granted the use of facilities and areas in Japan for the purpose of contributing
to the security of Japan and the maintenance of international peace and security in the Far East; therefore,
obligations of both countries are balanced taken all together. This is the difference from the North Atlantic
Treaty which regulates only actions for defense in concert with the other parties.
In addition, if an armed attack against Japan
breaks out, the USFJ facilities and areas will play an
important role in helping both countries take bilateral
actions immediately in accordance with the provisions
of Article 5 of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty, and
therefore maintaining stable use of them is extremely
important under the Japan-U.S. Security
Arrangements.
As already mentioned, an opponent will have to
directly confront U.S. forces in addition to the SDF.
U.S. forces in Japan will therefore act as deterrence to

U.S. forces’ nuclear carrier, “George Washington” that is scheduled to be prevent an Armed Attach against Japan.
deployed to Japan in 2008 [U.S. Navy]

Furthermore, operations to defend Japan will be
made not only by USFJ but also by timely reinforcements. The USFJ will provide bases to such reinforcements
of U.S. forces.
The USFJ fulfill these functions and play an extremely important role in ensuring Japan’s security. Military
presence of U.S. forces provides the basis for U.S. involvement in the region, which is indispensable for
maintaining regional peace and stability. (See Fig. III-2-1-2)

In order that USFJ facilities and areas fulfill their
roles, understandings and cooperation of local

located are essential. On the other hand, during the
past several decades since the conclusion of the JapanU.S. Security Treaty, the social environment has
greatly changed, including a growth of urban districts,
surrounding USFJ facilities and areas. For these

accepted and supported by Japanese people, it is necessary to minimize the impacts of USFJ facilities and areas
on local communities.
As the land of Japan is comparatively small and plain areas are limited, USFJ facilities and areas are
adjacent to urban or industrial areas in many communities. In such communities, the presence of USFJ
facilities and areas and takeoffs and landings of aircraft impact heavily on the daily lives of local people and
regional developments. That is a reason why appropriate efforts for reduction of the burdens on local
communities are necessary. (See Chapter4, Section2 • 3)

**3. USFJ in Okinawa**
Okinawa is located closer to countries in East Asia than U.S. mainland and territories such as Hawaii.
Therefore, in case of emergency in this region, U.S. forces in Okinawa may rapidly respond to the situation.
Furthermore, Okinawa has a geographic advantage that it is situated at certain distances from countries
surrounding Japan. It would appear that U.S. forces, including Marine Corps in charge of primary response to
contingencies, are stationed in Okinawa for above-mentioned reasons.
USFJ facilities and areas in Okinawa were furnished to U.S. forces as facilities and areas under the Status
of Forces Agreement when Okinawa was returned to Japan in May 1972. At present, most of these facilities
and areas, including airfields, maneuver areas and logistics support facilities, are located in the prefecture. In
terms of space, approximately 74% of the USFJ facilities and areas (for exclusive use) in Japan are
concentrated in Okinawa as of January 2007. It is therefore especially important to examine measures to reduce
the burdens on Okinawa.

**3. Post-Cold War Developments Concerning the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements**

**1. Japan-U.S. Joint Declaration on Security and Subsequent Developments**

During the Cold War era, the Japan-U.S. Security
Arrangements contributed to the maintenance of
security of Japan as a member of the Free World and
the maintenance of peace and security of the region
surrounding Japan. Since the end of the Cold War era,
Japan and the United States have held various types of
dialogues depending on changes in the international
security environment. The two countries announced
the Japan-U.S. Joint Declaration on Security, which
clarifies the direction of bilateral cooperation for the
21st century, at the Japan-U.S. summit meeting held in

Japanese and U.S. leaders appearing for a press interview after the Japan-U.S.
summit meeting Tokyo in April 1996.
(in April 2007) [Cabinet Public Relations Office] The Japan-U.S. Joint Declaration on Security

reaffirmed that the bilateral security relationship would remain the cornerstone for maintaining stability and
prosperity in the region, and indicated those cooperative measures in specific areas that would serve as
important pillars to enhance the credibility of the Japan-U.S. alliance.
Based on the Declaration, in September 1997, the two countries established new Guidelines for Japan-U.S.
Defense Cooperation (the “Guidelines”), and implemented various measures. Through these measures, JapanU.S. defense cooperation has become more effective, and the credibility of the Japan-U.S. Security
Arrangements has further strengthened. (See Reference 35) (See Section 3, 2 • Reference 42)


-----

**2. Japan-U.S. Alliance for the World and Asia**
At the Japan-U.S. summit meeting held in May 2003, the two countries agreed to enhance “the Japan-U.S.
Alliance in the Global Context,” including the enhancement of collaboration in responding to global problems
in cooperation with the international community. In concrete terms, Japan and the United States have
increasingly cooperated with each other in the areas of international activities, including the fight against
terrorism, humanitarian and reconstruction assistance in Iraq, assistance to sufferers of the earthquake and
tsunami in the Indian Ocean.
At the Japan-U.S. Summit Meeting held between Prime Minister Shinzou Abe and U.S. President George
W. Bush in November 2006, the two leaders confirmed that they would work on various challenges of the
international community based on the policy of Japan-U.S. Alliance for the World and Asia.
The two leaders confirmed that the Japan-U.S. relationship would be further strengthened. President Bush
reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to the maintenance of deterrence under the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements.
The two leaders agreed that Japan-U.S. cooperation in BMD would be further enhanced and accelerated and
foreign and defense ministers of both countries would be requested to examine this problem, and that the
realignment of U.S. forces in Japan would be steadily implemented.
As for Asian situation, the two leaders agreed on the importance of collaboration with Australia and India,
enhancement of relations with ASEAN countries and restoration of Afghanistan, and also agreed on responses
to the nuclear problem of North Korea. In addition, the two leaders confirmed that Japan and the United States
would respond to various problems, including the nuclear problem of Iran, in close coordination with each
other.
The collaboration between Japan and the United States, sharing the same fundamental values and interests
in many aspects, is not limited to that under the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements but extends to broad-based
themes in the world, in addition to those of the Asia-Pacific region.

Section 2. Japan-U.S. Security Consultation on the Future of the Japan-U.S.
Alliance

The maintenance of peace and security requires the appropriate development of its means depending on
changes in the security environment. To make the cooperative relationship between Japan and the United States
as Japan’s ally based on the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements effective, the Governments and people of both
countries must make constant efforts in developing the alliance depending on changes in the security
environment from time to time.
In consideration of the following changes, Japan and the United States have been engaged in consultations
on the future Japan-U.S. alliance, including force posture realignment, in recent years.
❍ Changes in the international security environment, such as emergence of new menaces and globalization of
menaces

❍ Remarkable improvements in military technologies, including improvement of information technology and
mobility, and progress in integration of various technologies

❍ Establishment of Japan’s National Defense Program Guidelines (NDPG), and transformation and posture

Security Consultation on the Future of the Japan-US Alliance


-----

As a result, the two countries have reached various epoch-making agreements for further enhancing future
Japan-U.S. alliance, including the May 2006 agreement on force posture realignment.
This section explains details of consultations, including the basic stance of the future Japan-U.S. alliance
and the realignment of USFJ.

**1. Outline of Recent Japan-U.S. Consultations**
Based on the understanding that it is important for Japan and the United States to maintain close exchanges in
reviewing respective defense and security policies in the new security environment, the Japan-U.S. Security
Consultative Committee[3] (hereafter referred to as the two-plus-two meeting) held in December 2002 confirmed
that the bilateral security consultations should be intensified. Since then, working-level consultations have been
held.
Those Japan-U.S. consultations have been conducted as part of bilateral strategic dialogues from a
viewpoint of how to make the capabilities of the Japan-U.S. alliance, which is indispensable to the maintenance
of peace and security of Japan, more effective in meeting changes of the times. Japan has proactively addressed
these consultations for the maintenance of its own security, based on the basic policy to maintain deterrence
and capabilities and to reduce burdens on local communities.
Japan’s this basic policy reflects the perception that amid changing security environment, in order to
remain strong, the Japan-U.S. alliance requires the enhancement of reliability and effectiveness of U.S.
commitment to the defense of Japan and the maintenance of peace and security of the Asia-Pacific region and
broad and firm support of the people of the two countries.
In response to significant changes in the security environment, Japan-U.S. consultations have confirmed
strategic objectives common to both countries at first, and then established the direction of Japan-U.S. alliance
gradually and comprehensively.
❍ Common Strategic Objectives (the First Stage)
The two countries identified the strategic objectives concerning defense and security that should be achieved
by them in cooperation with each other in the region and the world.

❍ Roles, Missions and Capabilities of Japan and the United States (the Second Stage)
The two countries examined the roles, missions and capabilities of the SDF and U.S. forces that would be
needed for achieving the strategic objectives identified at the first stage, taking into consideration the
developments and achievements of security and defense policies of the two countries in recent years.
This examination was made to clarify how Japan and the United States should cooperate with each other
through adequate coordination between the SDF and U.S. forces before the Unites States will begin force
posture realignment.

❍ Force Posture Realignment (Realignment of USFJ) (the Third Stage)
The two countries studied the postures of USFJ and the related SDF that would be necessary for
performing or demonstrating such roles, missions and capabilities that were examined at the second stage.
The broad overview of Japan-U.S. consultations is as per Fig.III-2-2-2. A joint document was produced at
each the two-plus-two meeting held at each stage. Thus, the transparency of consultations was ensured, and the
contents of consultations were made known in Japan and abroad at each stage. The contents of these
consultations are explained as follows.

**2. Common Strategic Objectives (the First Stage)**
The common strategic objectives at the first stage were reconfirmed in the joint statement at the two-plus-two
meeting held in February 2005. At this meeting, the two countries agreed that they should intensify
consultations on the sharing of the roles, missions and capabilities as examined at the second stage and on force
posture realignment as studied at the third stage.

**3. Roles, Missions and Capabilities of Japan and the United States (the Second Stage)**

**1. Outline**
At the second stage, the two countries examined how Japan and the United States, especially the SDF and U.S.
forces, should cooperate with each other through adequate coordination in achieving the common strategic
objectives set out at the first stage and in effectively responding to diverse challenges.
Pursuant to these consultations, the two-plus-two meeting held in October 2005 prepared a joint document
titled the U.S.-Japan Alliance: Transformation and Realignment for the Future (hereafter referred to as the SCC
document). The SCC document indicates the concrete direction of the roles, missions and capabilities shared
by Japan and the United States, and that of posture realignment of USFJ and the relevant units of the SDF. The
outline of the SCC document is as follows.
❍ Basic concepts of roles, missions and capabilities by placing primary emphasis on the following: “defense of
Japan and responses to situations in areas surrounding Japan, including responses to new threats and diverse
contingencies” and “efforts to improve the international security environment”

❍ Examples of operations in broad bilateral security and defense cooperation to be improved in a new security
environment

❍ Essential steps to strengthen posture for bilateral cooperation to respond to diverse challenges. These steps
include not only those related to the cooperation between the SDF and U.S. forces but also those that should
be addressed as government-wide efforts.

❍ Enhancement and expansion of Japan-U.S. security and defense cooperation
The particulars of the above-mentioned items are discussed below. Through realization of them, Japan-U.S.
alliance will be able to establish the capabilities to respond to diverse challenges effectively along with the
realignment of force posture, including that of USFJ.

**2. Basic Concepts of Roles, Missions and Capabilities**
The basic concepts on such primary areas indicated in the SCC document as “defense of Japan and responses to
situations in areas surrounding Japan, including responses to new threats and diverse contingencies” and
“efforts to improve the international security environment” are shown in Figs. III-2-2-3 and III-2-2-4. In due
consideration of the increasing importance of these areas, Japan and the United States will develop their
respective defense capabilities and maximize the benefits of innovations in technology.

**3. Examples of Operations in Bilateral Security and Defense Cooperation to be Improved**
The SCC document reconfirmed that the entire spectrum of bilateral cooperation must be strengthened. The
document pointed out specific examples of key areas for further enhancement in the current security
environment. (See Fig. III-2-2-5)

But the list of key areas is not intended to be an exhaustive list of possible areas of cooperation, and other
areas of operation not explicitly listed above remain important.

**4. Essential Steps to Strengthen Posture for Bilateral Security and Defense Cooperation**
It is important for Japan and the United States to intensify their postures of security and defense cooperation so
that the two countries may respond to diverse contingencies in a new security environment. For this purpose,
the two countries must implement necessary steps in peacetime. Above-mentioned individual areas of
cooperation must be sweepingly and comprehensively addressed not only by the SDF and U.S. forces but also
by their Governments as a whole. Some examples of the essential steps specified in the SCC document are
listed in Fig. III-2-2-6.


-----

**Fig. III-2-2-6 Measures Essential for Enhancing Bilateral Security and Defense Posture**

|Category Measures to be Addressed by Governments as a Whole|Item Close and continuous policy and operational coordination|Particulars • The close and continuous policy and operational coordination, which is conducted at multiple levels of the Governments of Japan and the United States, ranging from tactics of unit level to strategic consultations, is essential for responding to diverse security issues1. • Improvement of effectiveness of the comprehensive and coordination mechanisms based on the Guidelines by consolidating their functions|
|---|---|---|
||Advancing bilateral contingency planning|• Continuance of bilateral defense planning for the armed attack situation in Japan and mutual cooperation planning for the situation in areas surrounding Japan that are conducted under the Guidelines taking account of the changing security environment • Japan’s legislation to deal with contingency (providing a strengthened basis for contingency use by the SDF and U.S. forces of facilities, including airports and seaports) in above-mentioned planning • Close coordination relevant government agencies and local athorities, and detailed surveys of airports and seaports|
||Enhancing information sharing and intelligence cooperation|• Enhancement of sharing and cooperation of information and intelligence ranging from national strategy to unit’s tactic levels • Additional measures to protect secret information shared by related ministries and agencies|
|Measures to be Addressed by the SDF and U.S. Forces|Improving interoperability2 between the SDF and U.S. forces|• Maintenance of regular consultations to maintain and enhance interoperability • Enhancement of interoperability between headquarters of the SDF and U.S. Forces|
||Expansion of training opportunities in Japan and the United States|• Expansion of bilateral trainings and exercises (including the expansion of mutual use of training facilities and areas in Japan by the SDF and U.S. forces) • Expansion of trainings by the SDF in Guam, Alaska, Hawaii and U.S. mainland|
||Shared use of facilities by the SDF and U.S. forces|(To be specified when force posture is realigned)|
||Ballistic missile defense (BMD)|• Constant information gathering and sharing, and maintenance of readiness and interoperability • If appropriate, U.S. forces will additionally deploy supplemental capabilities to Japan and its surrounding areas and adjust their operations|



Notes: 1. Close policy consultations on security are conducted between officials of the Governments of Japan and the United States through the Security Consultative
Committee (SCC) of ministerial level (so-called two-plus-two meeting), the defense summit meeting of ministerial level, the Subcommittee for Defense
Cooperation (SDC) and others. As for operations, there exist the Comprehensive Mechanism and the Coordination Mechanism under the Guideline. (See
Section 3 of this chapter)
2. The term “interoperability” means that tactics, equipment, logistics support and the implementation guidelines for various operations have commonness and
duality.

**5. Enhancement and Expansion of Japan-U.S. Security and Defense Cooperation**
Basic stances on Japan-U.S. defense cooperation are indicated in the Guidelines, under which measures for
Japan-U.S. cooperation have been taken. In view of the current security environment, however, bilateral
cooperation in those fields that are not specified in the Guidelines, such as international peace cooperation
activities and BMD, is also important. In the future, the two countries will strengthen and improve the
effectiveness of bilateral cooperation under the Guidelines and, as appropriate, in additional areas not currently
addressed by the Guidelines.
As for the roles, missions and capabilities of Japan and the United States, the two countries emphasized at
the two-plus-two meeting held in May 2006 that the effectiveness of bilateral security and defense cooperation
in the field of bilateral contingency planning, information sharing and intelligence cooperation, and
international peace cooperation activities should be strengthened or improved. Furthermore, the two countries


-----

emphasized the importance of examining security and defense cooperation so that the two countries may
solidify the alliance relationship in changing regional and international security environments and improve the
alliance’s capabilities in responding to various challenges.
In the joint statement made at the two-plus-two meeting held in May 2007, the two countries reviewed
progress in updating roles, missions, and capabilities in line with the alliance transformation vision indicated in
the October 2005 SCC document, and highlighted as follows:
❍ The redefinition of the SDF’s primary mission to include international peacekeeping operations,
international disaster relief operations, and responses to situations in areas surrounding Japan;

❍ Sustained progress in developing more specific planning to reflect the evolving security environment and to
better posture the forces of the two countries to operate together in a regional crisis;

❍ Substantive agreement between the two governments concerning security measures for the protection of
classified military information, also known as a General Security of Military Information Agreement
(GSOMIA);

❍ Establishment of a bilateral Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) Defense Working
Group;

❍ Establishment of a flexible, bilateral interagency coordination mechanism to coordinate policy, operational,
intelligence, and public affairs positions before and during crisis situations; and

❍ Execution of joint, bilateral training exercises to strengthen interoperability and advance alliance roles,
missions, and capabilities.

**4. Force Posture Realignment, Including USFJ (the Third Stage)**

**1. Outline**
**(1) Review from the Viewpoint of the Maintenance of Deterrence and Capabilities and the**
**Reduction of Burdens on Local Communities**

The force posture realignment of USFJ is necessary to maintain the stable presence of USFJ, which serves as
deterrence and capabilities in the Asia-Pacific region, to adapt Japan-U.S. alliance based on the Japan-U.S.
Security Arrangements to a new security environment, and thereby to reinforce the peace of Japan and the
peace and security of the Asia-Pacific region.
The study on the realignment of USFJ was conducted based on the basic concept of maintaining deterrence
and capabilities and reducing burdens on local communities, and based on the examination of such roles,
missions and capabilities at the second stage that will be required for achieving the common strategic
objectives at the first stage.
As indicated in the SCC document issued in October 2005, the guiding precepts indicated in Fig. III-2-2-7
were established in the study based on the roles, missions and capabilities, and other factors.
Based on the past studies, the SCC document indicated a specific direction of the realignment of postures
of USFJ and related units of the SDF[4].

**(2) Finalization of Realignment Initiatives**
At the two-plus-two meeting held in May 2006, Japan and the United States finalized the force posture
realignment in a document titled the Japan-U.S. Roadmap for Realignment Implementation (hereafter referred
to as the Roadmap), which indicated the details for implementing concrete initiatives.
The outline of the Roadmap is shown in Figs. III-2-2-8 • 9.

-  Items written in boldface show the implementation of actual measures.

The implementation of these realignment initiatives will lead to a new phase in alliance cooperation and
strengthened alliance capabilities in the region. The measures to be implemented demonstrate the resolve of
both parties to strengthen their commitments under the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty and, at the same time, to
reduce the burden on local communities, including those on Okinawa. (See Reference 39)
The construction and other costs for facility development in the implementation of these initiatives will be
borne by the Government of Japan unless otherwise specified in the Roadmap. The U.S. Government will bear
the operational costs that arise from the implementation of these initiatives. Since the realignment of USFJ is
an important task to reduce burdens on local communities, including Okinawa, while maintaining deterrence
and capabilities of USFJ, it is decided that proper budgetary measures will be taken after having examined the
particulars of costs to be borne by Japan.

**(3) Steady Implementation of Realignment Initiatives**
At the two-plus-two meeting held in May 2007, the two countries reviewed the progress made in the past one
year with the initiatives described in the May 2006 Roadmap, and reaffirmed the importance of steady
implementation of the initiatives in accordance with the Japan-U.S. agreement.


-----

**2. Force Posture Realignment in Okinawa**
At present, many of USFJ facilities and areas are located in Okinawa.
In particular, U.S. Marine Corps in Okinawa with high mobility and readiness play multiple roles in
defending Japan, and in maintaining the peace and security of the region, including responses to the earthquake
that took place in Java, Indonesia in May 2006.
As part of its global military posture realignment effort, the U.S. is conducting some reviews to strengthen
its force structures in the Pacific. Among these reviews are a strengthening of Marine Corps crisis response
capabilities and a redistribution of those capabilities that will provide greater flexibility to respond with
appropriate capabilities according to the nature and location of particular situations. These reviews will also
enable increased security cooperation with countries in the region, thereby improving the overall security
environment.
In connection with this realignment, a set of integrated measures that will also substantially reduce burdens
on Okinawa are identified as follows.

**(1) Futenma Replacement Facility**
U.S. Marine Corps Futenma Air Station fulfills the following functions:
1) To transport ground units of Marine Corps by helicopters and other means;
2) To operate tanker aircraft;
3) To accommodate aircraft in case of emergency.
In the meantime, local residents have strongly demanded the early return of Futenma Air Station for their
concerns over safety, noise and traffic of the region as it is located in the middle of the residential area.
Therefore, the following initiatives will be implemented on the functions of Futenma Air Station, and then the
air station will be returned.

**a. Function to Transport Ground Units of Marine Corps by Helicopters and Other Means**
(a) Status of Basic Plan Based on the SACO Final Report
In the Special Action Committee on Okinawa (SACO) Final Report prepared in December 1996, the two
countries agreed to totally return Futenma Air Station after an adequate replacement facility is completed
within five to seven years. (See 6 of this section)
The sequence of events related to the replacement facility for Futenma Air Station (hereafter referred to as
the FRF (Futenma Replacement Facility)) after the issuance of the Final Report is shown in Fig.III-2-2-10. In
2002, the Basic Plan of the FRF was finalized. At this stage, more than six years had passed since the
agreement of return. After that, although an environmental impact assessment procedure started in 2004, the
return was not realized within five to seven years as originally scheduled, and has not been realized yet.
On the other hand, it was expected that it would take another ten years or so to relocate and return Futenma
Air Station for the following reasons: the technical site survey as necessary procedure for commencement of
construction began in 2003 after the Basic Plan of the FRF had been finalized, but the process did not go
smoothly; the environmental impact assessment procedure was expected to take approximately another three
years; and the construction of the FRF was expected to take nine and a half years.
In addition, a helicopter accident took place in Ginowan City in August 2004. It became evident that the
existence of Futenma Air Station in the middle of the residential area has a potential risk, and therefore it was
strongly recognized that the early relocation and return of Futenma Air Station is essential.
In order to drive away a general feeling of unrest among local residents, the two Governments conducted a
study again on how to realize early relocation and return of Futenma Air Station during the course of JapanU.S. consultations on the realignment of USFJ.

**(b) Basic Concept of the FRF**
Marine Corps consist of air, ground, logistics and command elements, and the interaction of those elements in
actual operations is necessary. Therefore, both sides conducted a study based on the recognition that the FRF
needs to be located within Okinawa Prefecture so that rotary wing aircraft currently stationed at Futenma Air
Station will be located near the other elements with which they train, maneuver and operate on a regular basis.
In the study, both sides considered several factors, including safety of neighboring communities and
military personnel, noise impacts on local communities, impacts on the natural environment including seaweed beds, and operational requirements in peacetime and in contingencies.

**(c) General Description of the FRF**
Based on the aforementioned concept, both sides conducted the study intensively. As a result, in the SCC
document prepared in October 2005, the initiative to “locate the FRF in an “L”-shaped configuration that
combines the shoreline areas of Camp Schwab and adjacent water areas of Oura Bay” was approved.
Thereafter, as a result of consultation with local municipalities, including Nago City, agreements on the
FRF were made with Nago City and Ginoza Village in April 2006 stating that, based on the initiative approved
in the SCC document, two runways would be constructed to avoid an air route above the surrounding area
pursuant to the request from the local communities, and that the runways should be constructed by paying due


-----

attention to the following points—1) safety of lives of local residents; 2) conservation of the natural
environment; and 3) the feasibility of the project. Then, it was decided that the Ministry of Defense, Okinawa
Prefecture, Nago City, Ginoza Village and related local municipalities would continue to have consultations on
the plan of construction of the FRF in good faith on a continuous basis to reach a conclusion.
Based on the above-mentioned agreement, both countries agreed, in the Roadmap prepared in May 2006, to
locate the FRF in a configuration that combines the Henoko-saki and adjacent water areas of Oura and Henoko
Bays. This facility includes two runways aligned in a “V”-shape, each runway having a length of 1,600 meters
plus two 100-meter overruns. The length of each runway portion of the facility is 1,800 meters, exclusive of
seawalls.
The facility ensures agreed operational capabilities while addressing issues of safety, noise, and
environmental impacts.
As indicated in the SACO Final Report, the FRF will have capabilities to support operations of helicopters
now stationed in Futenma Air Station and short-field aircraft operations. There’s no plan to operate fighter
aircraft from this facility.
Furthermore, it is indicated that, in order to locate the FRF in the Camp Schwab area, necessary
adjustments will be made, such as reconfiguration of Camp Schwab facilities and adjacent water surface areas.
In principle, the construction method for the FRF will be landfill. The construction work is targeted for
completion by 2014. It is indicated that relocation to the FRF will occur when the facility is fully operationally
capable. (See Fig. III-2-2-11)

In the case of the newly agreed FRF, construction will be made mainly on land and therefore construction
work may be started earlier and completed more steadily as compared with the old plan. Thus, earlier
relocation becomes possible. In addition, the portion to be constructed in the offshore area will be made as
smaller as possible. Thus, full consideration is given to environmental impacts.


-----

Concerning the construction of the FRF, the Governor of Okinawa Prefecture and the then Minister of State
for Defense signed, in May 2006, a Memorandum of Basic Understanding in which both parties agreed to cope
with the issue based on the Government plan and paying due attention to: 1) removal of danger of Futenma Air
Station; 2) safety of lives of local residents; 3) conservation of the natural environment; and 4) feasibility of the
project.
The Government made a cabinet decision on May 30, 2006 to proceed with the construction based on the
plan approved at the two-plus-two meeting held on May 1, 2006 and by taking into consideration the positions
of the Government, Okinawa Prefecture and the related local municipalities and background of the relocation
of Futenma Air Station, and to develop a construction plan immediately. It was also decided that the specific
construction plan, safety/environmental measures and local development measures should be addressed
through consultations made at a consultative organ, which is established jointly with Okinawa Prefecture and
related local municipalities[5].
Since August 2006, the Council Meetings on Measures for Relocation of Futenma Air Station[6] have been
held as follows.
❍ First Council Meeting (on August 29, 2006)
Based on the cabinet decision on May 30, 2006, the Council was established to discuss a specific
construction plan for the FRF, safety/environmental measures and local economic promotion measures.

❍ Second Council Meeting (on December 25, 2006)

-  The second Council Meeting was held with the attendance of the Chief Cabinet Secretary. The newly
appointed Ministers in charge and newly elected Governor of Okinawa Nakaima made remarks on the
stances of the Government and the Prefecture involved, respectively.

-  The members agreed that this Council Meeting would be held continually in the future and they would
make efforts to realize early and smooth relocation of Futenma Air Station.

❍ Third Council Meeting (on January 19, 2007)

-  The contents of the Memorandums of Basic Agreement concluded with the Mayors of Nago City and
Ginoza Village and the Memorandum of Basic
Understanding concluded with the Governor of
Okinawa were reconfirmed, and opinions were
exchanged.

-  The members agreed that they would make efforts to
build a relationship of mutual trust and attend this
Council Meeting continually in the future with the
aim of realizing early and smooth relocation of
Futenma Air Station.
In addition, the engineering and technical design
for the FRF was elaborated, and in April 2007, surveys

**b. Function to Operate Tanker Aircraft**
With regard to air refueling aircraft KC-130 (12 in total), which are to be relocated from Futenma Air Station
to Iwakuni Air Base under the SACO Final Report, the SCC document dated October 2005 states that
alternative facilities would be considered with priority consideration given to JMSDF Kanoya Base. As the
result of a further study, however, it was finalized in the Roadmap in May 2006 that the aircraft would be
relocated to Iwakuni Air Base, the same as the SACO Final Report.


-----

KC-130 aircraft will regularly deploy on a rotational basis for training and operations to Maritime SDF
Kanoya Base and Guam.

**c. Base Function to Accommodate Aircraft in Contingencies**
Strengthened contingency use of Nyutabaru Air Base (in Miyazaki Prefecture) and Tsuiki Air Base (in
Fukuoka Prefecture) of ASDF will be provided for U.S. forces. Facility improvements for this purpose will be
made as necessary after conducting site surveys and before Futenma Air Station is returned. These improved
facilities, when completed, will also support the expanded bilateral training activities described in the Roles,
Missions and Capabilities section of this report.
Improved contingency use of civilian facilities for long runway operations that cannot be replicated at the
FRF will be examined in the context of bilateral contingency planning, and appropriate arrangements will be
made in order to realize the return of Futenma Air Station.

**(2) Force Reductions and Relocation to Guam**
In conjunction with the realignment of U.S. Marine Corps capabilities in the Asia-Pacific region, the personnel
of the III Marine Expeditionary Force (III MEF) will be relocated to Guam and the remaining Marine units in
Okinawa will be realigned. Due to this realignment in Okinawa, it is planned that approximately 8,000 III MEF
personnel and their approximately 9,000 dependents will relocate from Okinawa to Guam by 2014 in a manner
that maintains unit integrity.
Units to relocate include: III MEF Command Element, 3d Marine Division Headquarters, 3d Marine
Logistics Group (formerly known as Force Service Support Group) Headquarters, 1st Marine Air Wing
Headquarters, and 12th Marine Regiment Headquarters. The affected units will relocate from such facilities as
Camp Courtney, Camp Hansen, Futenma Air Station, Camp Zukeran, and Makiminato Service Area. On the
other hand, it is indicated that U.S. Marine Corps forces remaining on Okinawa will consist of Marine AirGround Task Force elements, such as command, ground, aviation, and combat service support, as well as a
base support capability.
As for costs of relocating U.S. forces to Guam, the Governments of both Japan and the United States held
consultations on how both sides should share such costs. At the Japan-U.S. defense summit meeting held in
April 2006, both sides agreed on the sharing of costs for providing facilities and infrastructure involved in the
relocation of U.S. forces to Guam.
Specifically, of the estimated total cost of $10.27 billion, Japan will bear $6.09 billion, including financial
contribution and loan for providing recoverable houses for military families and infrastructure, and the total
cost will include $2.8 billion or less in direct fiscal spending. The United States will fund $4.18 billion,
including $3.18 billion or less in direct fiscal spending. (See 5 of this section)

**(3) Land Returns and Shared Use of Facilities**
**a. Return of Significant Land Area South of Kadena Air Base**
The facilities and areas of USFJ are located in densely populated areas south of Kadena Air Base
(approximately 1,500ha in total). Following the relocation and return of Futenma Air Station, and the transfer
of III MEF personnel to Guam, the remaining facilities and areas on Okinawa will be consolidated, thereby
enabling the return of significant land areas south of Kadena Air Base.
In the Roadmap prepared in May 2006, Japan and the United States agreed to develop a detailed
consolidation plan for the six candidate facilities (Camp Kuwae, Camp Zukeran, Futenma Air Station,
Makiminato Service Area, Naha Port, and Army POL Depot Kuwae Tank Farm No.1). At present, the plan is
under deliberation between both countries. (See Fig. III-2-2-8)


-----

**b. Steady Implementation of the SACO Final Report**
The steady implementation of the SACO Final Report prepared in 1996 is important because it aims to
properly maintain the capabilities and readiness of USFJ and to reduce impacts of operations of U.S. forces on
local residents of Okinawa. In the Roadmap prepared in May 2006, Japan and the United States agreed to the
possibility that the SACO relocation and return initiatives may need to be re-evaluated.

**c. Shared Use of USFJ Facilities and Areas in Okinawa**
The SDF has only a limited number of facilities in Okinawa, including Naha Air Base, and most of them are
located in urbanized areas with some operational restriction. Therefore, the shared use of USFJ facilities and
areas in Okinawa will greatly improve the training environment for SDF’s units in Okinawa, and facilitate joint
training and interoperability between the SDF and U.S. forces. Some of the shared use will improve readiness
and contribute to maintaining the safety of local residents at a time of disaster.
Based on such concepts, Camp Hansen will be used for GSDF training. ASDF will use Kadena Air Base
for bilateral training with U.S. forces taking into account noise impacts on local communities.

**(4) Relationships among Realignment Initiatives**
Within the overall realignment package in the Roadmap prepared in May 2006, the Okinawa-related
realignment initiatives are interconnected. Specifically, consolidation and land returns south of Kadena Air
Base depend on completing the relocation of III MEF personnel and dependents from Okinawa to Guam. The
III MEF relocation from Okinawa to Guam is dependent on: 1) tangible progress toward completion of the
FRF; and 2) Japan’s financial contribution to fund development of required facilities and infrastructure on
Guam.

**3. Improvement of U.S. Army Command and Control Capacity**
U.S. Army headquarters in Japan at Camp Zama (in Kanagawa Prefecture) will be transformed into a joint-task
capable headquarters with high mobility and readiness by U.S. Fiscal Year 2008[7]. This transformation is made
based on the global realignment of U.S. Army as part of the overall transformation of U.S. forces. The
transformed U.S. Army headquarters in Japan will continue to hold the same core mission to defend Japan and
maintain the peace and security of the Far East.
To enable rapid responses to various contingencies, the headquarters of GSDF Central Readiness Force that
centrally controls mobile operation units and specialized units will relocate to Camp Zama by Japan Fiscal
Year 2012 so that it may strengthen coordination with the transformed U.S. Army headquarters in Japan.
Along with the transformation of U.S. Army headquarters, a battle command training center and other
support facilities will be constructed within U.S. Forces Sagami General Depot (SGD) (in Kanagawa
Prefecture) using U.S. funding. In relation to this transformation, measures will be implemented for more
efficient and effective use of Camp Zama and SGD, including partial returns of these facilities.

**4. Yokota Air Base and Airspace**

**(1) Establishment of the Bilateral and Joint Operations Coordination Center (BJOCC)**
The enhancement of coordination between headquarters is quite important for ensuring flexible and rapid
responses of the SDF and U.S. forces. The headquarters of USFJ located at Yokota Air Base (in Tokyo) plays
an important position in the various mechanisms[8] under the Guidelines. Recently, the SDF has adopted a new
joint operations structure, while U.S. forces have intensified their joint operations.
Therefore, along with the relocation of ASDF Air Defense Command as mentioned below, the Bilateral
and Joint Operations Coordination Center (BJOCC) will be established. Concerning air defense and BMD, the


-----

BJOCC will perform a function to facilitate bilateral actions for the defense of Japan by making close
coordination between headquarters of SDF and U.S. forces and improving interoperability, and by enabling
Joint Staff Office of the SDF and headquarters of USFJ to share the same information.

**(2) Relocation of ASDF Air Defense Command**
ASDF Air Defense Command located in Fuchu City, Tokyo has an air defense mission, and will have a
function of headquarters for BMD in the future. In the case of air defense and BMD, response time is very
short. Therefore, it is quite important for the SDF and U.S. forces to immediately share the necessary
information. Thus, in Japan Fiscal Year 2010, ASDF Air Defense Command and relevant units will relocate to
Yokota Air Base where the headquarters of U.S. 5th Air Force is located. This arrangement and the
establishment of the above-mentioned BJOCC will enhance coordination between headquarter of the SDF and
U.S. forces, including the sharing of information concerning air defense and BMD.

**(3) Yokota Airspace**
At Yokota Air Base, U.S. forces conduct radar approach control for the Yokota airspace spreading from the
western part of the Tokyo Metropolitan area to Niigata Prefecture. To facilitate the operation of those civilian
airplanes that must deviate from the airspace, however, the following measures are pursued.
**a. Establish a program in Japan Fiscal Year 2006 to inform commercial aviation entities of the existing**
procedure needed for transiting Yokota airspace.

**b. Develop a procedure in Japan Fiscal Year 2006 for temporary transfer of air traffic control responsibility to**
Japanese authorities for portions of Yokota airspace, when not required by military purposes.

**c. Return portions of Yokota airspace to Japanese authorities by September 2008 after having identified the**
returned portions by October 2006.

**d. Complete a study[9]** of the conditions required for the possible return of the entire Yokota airspace by Japan
Fiscal Year 2009.
Then, the procedure mentioned in b as above started in September 2006. The themes of 1) identification of
the airspace portions to be returned by September 2008 and 2) collocation of U.S. forces and SDF controllers at
the Yokota Radar Approach Control (Yokota RAPCON) facility have been examined by the Civil Aeronautics
Subcommittee established under the Japan-U.S. Joint Committee, approved by the Japan-U.S. Joint Committee,
and mutually agreed by the Governments of both countries, in October 2006. Once the airspace portions
mentioned in above item 1) is returned to Japan, the airspace portion of the Yokota airspace adjoining the
western part of Haneda International Airport will be reduced by approximately 40%. Further in connection
with item 2), Japanese Air SDF traffic controllers will be collocated at Yokota Air Base in May 2007.
The lessons learned from experiences with the collocation will be taken into account in the study of the
conditions required for the possible return of the entire Yokota airspace. (See Fig. III-2-2-12)

**(4) Civilian-Military Dual-Use of Yokota Air Base**
At the Japan-U.S. Summit Meeting held in May 2003, the two countries agreed that the feasibility of a civilianmilitary dual-use of Yokota Air Base be jointly studied by the Governments of both countries. Then, a Liaison
Conference was formed as a panel attended by representatives of ministries and agencies (the Cabinet
Secretariat, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport, the Defense
Agency (now the Ministry of Defense), the Defense Facilities Administration Agency) and the Tokyo
Metropolitan Government. Since then, the meeting of the Liaison Conference has been held as required.
The Governments of Japan and the United States will conduct a study of the specific conditions and
modalities for possible civilian-military dual use of Yokota Air Base, to be completed within 12 months from


-----

commencement. The study, which started in October 2006, will be conducted on the shared understanding that

the dual-use must not compromise military operations and safety or the military operational capabilities of
Yokota Air Base. Based on the outcome of this study, both Governments will consult and then make
appropriate decisions on the civilian-military dual use.

**5. Relocation of Carrier Air Wing from Atsugi Air Base to Iwakuni Air Base**

**(1) Significance of Deployment of U.S. Aircraft Carriers**
The presence of U.S. Pacific Fleet plays an important role in maintaining the peace and stability of the AsiaPacific region, including the safety of its maritime traffic. U.S. aircraft carriers play a core role in the Fleet. At


-----

present, the U.S. aircraft carrier, Kitty Hawk, has been deployed in this region and has been visiting Yokosuka
(in Kanagawa Prefecture). The homeport for the U.S. aircraft carrier must be provided in Japan to maintain the
forward-deployed capabilities of the carrier and its aircraft for a long time.
In October 2005, the U.S. Navy announced that the U.S. aircraft carrier, Kitty Hawk, would be
decommissioned in 2008 to be replaced by a nuclear aircraft carrier. Then, the U.S. Navy determined and
announced that Kitty Hawk would be replaced with the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, George Washington.
For this replacement, Japan and the United States agreed in June 2006 that the Government of Japan would
carry out dredging work in the restricted water area of Yokosuka Naval Base in order to ensure safe operations
of the nuclear aircraft carrier.
Based on this agreement, Defense Facilities Administration Agency completed survey and design works in
JFY 2006, and finished legal port consultation with Yokosuka City, port manager, on the dredging work in
April 2007. The dredging work is scheduled to be completed by May 2008.

**(2) Base for Carrier-Based Aircraft**
When the U.S. aircraft carrier is deployed at Yokosuka, Atsugi Air Base (in Kanagawa Prefecture) is now used
as a base for carrier-based aircraft. Since Atsugi Air Base is located in an urban center, noise of landings and
takeoffs of carrier jets in particular has caused problems for a long time.
These problems should be resolved as soon as possible in order to stably maintain Japan-U.S. Security
Arrangements and the operations of carriers under the arrangements into the future.
After the completion of the runway relocation project at Iwakuni Air Base, the safe operations of aircraft
will be possible with less impact on the living environment of local communities.
In consideration of these matters, Carrier Air Wing Five (CVW-5) squadrons will be relocated from Atsugi
Air Base to Iwakuni Air Base. This relocation, consisting of F/A-18, EA-6B, E-2C and C-2 aircraft (59 aircraft
in total), will be completed by 2014, subsequent to the following: (1) completion of necessary facilities, and (2)
adjustment of training airspace and the Iwakuni RAPCON airspace.
Above-mentioned relocations will be implemented after the runway is relocated offshore to mitigate
impacts of increasing operations by the U.S. forces. In addition, such related measures will be taken including
the relocation of MSDF’s EP-3 and other aircraft from Iwakuni Air Base to Atsugi Air Base, regular
deployment of KC-130 aircraft (relocated from Futenma Air Station to Iwakuni Air Base) to MSDF Kanoya
Base and Guam on a rotational basis, and the relocation of U.S. Marine Corps CH-53D helicopters from
Iwakuni Air Base to Guam. It is expected that noise problems in most of the communities around Iwakuni Air
Base will be alleviated due to these measures as the
first-category area that requires residential noiseabatement work decreases from approximately
1,600ha of present area to 500ha. Furthermore, safety
will be improved as the runway will be relocated
offshore and approaching and takeoff routes will be
established above the water. (See Fig. III-2-2-8)
As for field-carrier landing practice, a bilateral
framework to conduct a study on a permanent fieldcarrier landing practice facility will be established with
the goal of selecting a permanent site by July 2009 or
the earliest possible date thereafter. In addition, the
SCC document confirmed that U.S. forces will
continue to conduct field-carrier landing practice at


-----

Iwo Jima in accordance with the existing temporary
arrangements until a permanent field-carrier landing
practice facility is identified.

**(3)Commercial airport at Iwakuni Air Base**
Considering that the local governments, including
Yamaguchi Prefecture and Iwakuni City, have been
unitedly requesting for a commercial airport at

U.S. forces’ Aegis-equipped cruiser with BMD capability, “Shiloh” Iwakuni Air Base, the Government of Japan and the

[U.S. Navy] Government of the United States have been discussing

within the framework of the Japan-U.S. Joint Committee to identify such issues as the relationship between
commercial aviation resumption and U.S. forces’ operations and to examine the feasibility of commercial
aviation. As a result, in October 2005, it was mutually agreed at a meeting of the Committee that commercial
aviation operations at Iwakuni Air Base of four round trips per day will be allowed as long as such operations
do not compromise U.S. military operational requirements.
Since then, this issue has been discussed as part of the discussions on the realignment of USFJ. After it was
agreed upon in the Roadmap in May 2006 that portions of the future civilian air facility would be
accommodated at MCAS Iwakuni, locations of the civil airport facility and other related matters have been
discussed between the two Governments with the assumption that the realignment of USFJ will be
implemented.

**6. Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD)**
As confirmed in the study on the roles, missions and capabilities, Japan and the United States will continue
close coordination on BMD as the two countries improve their respective BMD capabilities.
ASDF Shariki Subbase (in Aomori Prefecture) was designated as the optimum site for deployment of a
new U.S. Forward Based X-Band Transportable (FBX-T) Radar System (AN/TPY-2; hereafter referred to as
the X-Band Radar System) with the sophisticated capability to search and track ballistic missiles[10]. The data
obtained by the X-Band Radar System will be shared by the two countries. Thereby, the capabilities to
intercept missiles directed at Japan and capabilities for Japan’s civil protection and consequence management.
The X-Band Radar System was deployed at ASDF Shariki Subbase in June 2006.
Also, to ensure defense against missile attacks directed at Japan, U.S. Patriot PAC-3 capabilities will be
deployed to Japan within existing U.S. facilities and areas, becoming operational at the earliest possible time.
The deployment of Patriot PAC-3 capabilities to Kadena Air Base and Kadena Ammunition Storage Area
started in September 2006. These capabilities became partially operational from the end of December 2006. In
August 2006, the Aegis-equipped cruiser with BMD capabilities, Shiloh, which is forward-deployed in the
Western Pacific region, visited Yokosuka Naval Base.
The deployment of U.S. forces’ BMD capabilities to Japan contributes to the improvement of our country’s
defense against missile attacks, the maintenance of deterrence of USFJ and the safety of Japanese citizens.

**7. Training Relocation**
Initially, aircraft from three U.S. facilities, Kadena, Misawa (in Aomori Prefecture) and Iwakuni will
participate in relocated training conducted from the following SDF facilities: Chitose (in Hokkaido), Misawa,
Hyakuri (in Ibaraki Prefecture), Komatsu (in Ishikawa Prefecture), Tsuiki and Nyutabaru.
In March 2007, U.S. forces conducted relocated training from U.S. Kadena Air Base to ASDF Tsuiki Air
Base. As for the training relocation plan for JFY 2007, the outline was announced in January 2007 and U.S.
forces conducted relocated training from U.S. Kadena Air Base to ASDF Komatsu Air Base in May 2007.


-----

The Government of Japan will improve
infrastructure for training relocation at SDF facilities
as necessary after conducting site surveys.

**5. Initiatives for Smooth Implementation of**
**the Realignment of USFJ**

**1. Basic Policy**
The Roadmap prepared by Japan and the United States U.S. force’s fighter jets came flying from Kadena Air Base to ASDF’s Tsuiki Base(in Fukuoka prefecture) (in March 2007)
in May 2006 intends to enhance the effectiveness of
the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements, maintain deterrence and capabilities, and contribute to the long-awaited
reduction of burdens on local communities where USFJ facilities and areas are located. Therefore, it is
important to steadily implement the realignment initiatives specified in the Roadmap.
In this connection, in May 2006, the Cabinet approved the Efforts by the Government of Japan regarding
realignment of U.S. force structure in Japan and others. The outline of the concepts and policies specified in the
decision is as follows.
❍ Local development and other measures will be taken for some local governments which are to bear new
burdens in return for their contributions to the peace and security of Japan, and efforts will be made to
facilitate the use of returned sites and to ensure the employment of Japanese employees for USFJ.

❍ The Government of Japan will share necessary costs to relocate of U.S. Marine Corps in Okinawa to Guam
and implement the early relocation.

❍ The Government will take actions needed to implement the specific realignment measures properly and
rapidly. The Government experiencing the harsh public finance, however, should rationalize and streamline
defense-related expenditures to ensure the efficient defense build-up, while making more efforts to cut on
the entire government expenditures.
At a meeting of the Government and Ruling Parties Council on Realignment of U.S. Forces Structure in
Japan held in December 2006[11], the Government and the Ruling Parties agreed to develop a law for smooth
implementation of the realignment of USFJ and to include expenses of new subsidy in the 2007 fiscal year
budget. (See Reference 40)
In September 2006, the Ministry of Defense established the HQ for the Implementation of U.S. Force
Structure Realignment Project in order to develop a frame work in which the Ministry of Defense and the
Defense Facilities Administration Agency will be able to steadily implement realignment-initiatives and
promote the studies on the roles, missions and capabilities of Japan and the United States.

**2. Development of a Law for Smooth Implementation of the Realignment of USFJ**
In response to the above-mentioned basic policy, the Cabinet approved the Special Measures Bill concerning
Smooth Implementation of the Realignment of U.S. Forces in Japan and Related SDF Forces (The Special
Measures Bill for the Realignment of USFJ and SDF) on February 9, 2007, and submitted it to the ordinary
session of the Diet. The Special Measures Bill for Realignment was passed by the Diet, and became a law, on
May 23, 2007. The outline of the law is as follows.

**(1) Institutionalization of Provision of New Grants to Local Municipalities (Realignment**
**Grant)**
**a. Purpose of Realignment Grant**
The benefits of the peace and security of a nation are equally enjoyed by its people. The realignment of USFJ
contributes to a reduction in U.S. base-related burdens on Japan as a whole. In some local communities,


-----

however, training and force’s relocation will be newly started due to the realignment, and U.S. base-related
burdens will be increased. As a result, residents of certain local communities only must bear increased burdens
due to the realignment of USFJ.
Although residents of these local communities have pros and cons, all of such local communities are
willing to accept such increased burdens for the maintenance of peace and security of Japan.
The realignment grant is one of the measures to be implemented by the Government for those local
municipalities that are willing to accept increased burdens in appreciation of their contribution to the
maintenance of peace and security of Japan. The realignment grant is needed for facilitating the smooth
implementation of the realignment of USFJ.
The realignment grant is a special grant extended in addition to expenses for measures around bases[12] which
have been practiced and aims to smoothly carry out the special project to promote the realignment of U.S.
forces in Japan. The grant will be used, not to reduce or alleviate the burden caused by the realignment, but to
improve the convenience of lives of residents in the local communities where the realignment is implemented
and to contribute to the promotion of local industries, during the period—ten years in principle—including the
duration before and after the realignment.

**b. Mechanism of Allocation of Realignment Grant**
❍ In connection with the realignment of USFJ[13], the Minister of Defense designates such local municipalities,
the stability of lives of residents of which will be threatened by increased adverse influences due to the
existence of defense facilities concerned, and other local municipalities surrounding these municipalities.

❍ Grants will be allocated to such local municipalities, and used as expenses of the projects that contribute to
the improvement of convenience of lives of residents and the promotion of industries[14].

❍ These grants will be allocated to such local municipalities in consideration of the degree of increase in
adverse influences on lives of residents, of the scope of such influences, and depending on the progress of
measures for the realignment of USFJ.
Since the amount of grant is determined depending on the progress of realignment measures, this
mechanism is appropriate for the policy objective to implement the realignment of USFJ.

**(2) Establishment of Exception to the Grant Rate for Public Works Projects, or Other**
**Treatment**
**a. Necessity of Establishment of Exception to the Grant Rate for Public Works Projects, or of**
**Other Treatment**

Among the local municipalities whose burdens will increase, there are some whose burdens are extremely
heavy, for example, due to the relocation of units with many aircraft. These municipalities will be required to
carry out public works such as roads and ports promptly and, providing special grant-rate measures to such
municipalities will contribute to a smooth implementation of the realignment. However, the public works as
mentioned above will often be implemented by the national government or prefectures and, in some cases, will
be limited to certain municipalities. It is feared that the public works may be infeasible with the realignment
grant. Therefore, the Special Measures Law for the Realignment of USFJ and SDF provides measures to
promote industrial development for the region consisting of municipalities with heavy burdens and surrounding
municipalities[15] (Special Region for Promotion of Realignment-Related Industrial Development). (See Fig. III2-2-13)

**b. Mechanism of Special Measures for Special Area**
❍ A council chaired by Minister of Defense and consisted of relevant Ministers (Council for Local
Development concerning Realignment of U.S. Forces in Japan and Related SDF Forces[16]) will be established
under the Ministry of Defense.

❍ The Governor of a prefecture will apply to Minister of Defense for the designation of Special Area for
Development concerning Realignment, and submit a development plan (Special Area for Development
concerning Realignment-draft), including public works projects for road, port and others.

❍ Upon receipt of an application from the Governor of a prefecture, the Council will deliberate on the
designation of Special Area for Development concerning Realignment and on the decision of Area
Development Plan for the area.

❍ As for public works projects under the Development Plan for Special Area for Development concerning
Realignment have been deliberated and approved at the Council, the percentage of expenses borne by the
Government, or grant rate, for those projects of improvement of road, port or others[17] that should be
immediately implemented in consideration of the particulars and degree of adverse influences caused by the
realignment of USFJ on local communities will be higher than those for ordinary cases.

**(3) Special Operations of Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) and Other**
**Measures**
**a. Reasons Why Japan Shares Expenses of Relocating U.S. Forces to Guam**
The relocation of U.S. Marine Corps stationing in Okinawa to Guam has been strongly desired by the residents
of Okinawa Prefecture. Considering the fact that approximately 74% of facilities and areas used by the USFJ
are concentrated on Okinawa, which has great impact on the living environment of residents and on regional
development, it is important to realize the relocation of U.S. Marine Corps from Okinawa to Guam as soon as
possible, which enables the reduction of burdens on Okinawa while maintaining the deterrence and capabilities
of the USFJ.
Therefore, the Government of Japan has actively approached the United States to negotiate the relocation.
As a result, the two countries agreed on the sharing of costs of the relocation.

**b. Japan’s Stance on Cost Sharing**
If the United States alone undertakes the development of necessary facilities and infrastructure in Guam, the
task is expected to take very long time, despite the need to realize the relocation at an early date. Therefore, the


-----

Government of Japan decided to support the United States in its development of necessary facilities, including
Marine headquarters buildings, barracks and family housing, and infrastructure Japan will bear the cost for the
relocation on the basis of actual requirement of facilities and infrastructure. In other words, Japan will not bear
the cost based on a certain percentage of the total costs necessary for the relocation, which the United States
requested in the negotiation.
The Government of Japan will provide direct cash contribution to develop Marine headquarters buildings,
instruction buildings, barracks and quality of life (QOL) facilities, including schools, because in these projects
it is difficult to recover project funds from rent or charge for use. On the other hand, the development of family
housing and infrastructure, such as electrical power, potable water, and waste water and solid waste disposal,
will be funded by private finance initiatives so that the Government of Japan’s financial burden may be
reduced as much as possible. The funds for projects that are raised by private finance initiatives will be
recovered by rents and service charges paid by the U.S. side in the future.
The agreed amounts of the costs of relocation to Guam to be shared by Japan and the United States are based
on the estimation prepared by the U.S. side at the stage of study, and therefore such amounts are only rough
estimate. To reduce and rationalize the amount of cost to be borne by Japan, it will be important for the
Government of Japan to carefully examine concrete project schemes and the detailed estimate for spending.
Therefore, GOJ will take the budgetary measure only after thorough examinations have been made in cooperation
with JBIC and all efforts have been made to reduce the amount of costs required. (See Fig. III-2-2-14)

**Fig. III-2-2-14 Breakdown of Cost of Relocating U.S. Forces to Guam**

|Project|Col2|Sources|Amount|Col5|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Cost borne by Japan|Marine headquarters buildings, instruction buildings, barracks and QOL facilities including schools|(Direct) fiscal spending|$2.80 billion (upper limit)||
||Family housing|Equity Investment|$1.5 billion|$2.55 billion|
|||Loan, etc|$0.63 billion||
|||Cost reduction by improved efficiency|$0.42 billion||
||Infrastructure (electricity, potable water and waste water, and disposal of solid waste)|Loan, etc|$0.74 billion||
||Total||$6.09 billion||
|Cost borne by the United States|Helidromes, communication facilities, training support facilities, repair and refilling facilities, fuel and ammunition warehouses, and other base facilities|(Direct) fiscal spending|$3.18 billion||
||Road (high-standard road)|Loan or (direct) fiscal spending|$1 billion||
||Total||$4.18 billion||
||Grand total||$10.27 billion||



Notes: 1. The amounts and schemes are subject to change.
2. Japan is committed to sharing cost not according to the ratio to the total amount but
based on the amount required for each of the facilities and infrastructures.
The cost will be further examined and upper limits are shown for (direct) fiscal spending.
3. As for family housing, the cost was reduced by $0.42 billion (by improved efficiency) from
$2.55 billion to $2.13 billion
4. As for equity investment and loan, the amount spent will be recovered through rents and
fees paid by the Untied States.
5. The cost of moving the Marine Corps from Okinawa to Guam and the cost for the activities
of the Corps in Guam are not included in the grand total of $10.27 billion

**c. Outline of Special Financial Operations of JBIC**
To properly and stably implement overseas projects for which private finance initiative is utilized for a long
period, it will be necessary to employ the capability of JBIC which has expertise and experience in this field.
Therefore, it was decided to authorize the JBIC to consider the Financing Operations for Facilitating the
Realignment of U.S. Forces in Japan as special operations under the Special Measures Law for the
Realignment of USFJ and SDF, so that JBIC may make capital investments, loans and other operations that
will be needed for projects to facilitate the relocation of U.S. Marine Corps in Okinawa to Guam, and to
authorize the Government of Japan to take special financial measures for such operations. (See Fig. III-2-2-15)

The employment of USFJ local employees may be adversely affected, because defense facilities will be
returned, U.S. Marine Corps in Okinawa will relocate to Guam, and other measures will be taken as a result of
the realignment of USFJ.
Therefore, the Government of Japan decided to take measures to maintain the employment of USFJ local
employees, including education and skill training.

**(5) Validity of the Law**
❍ The law shall be temporary statute with a ten-year life span.
❍ Despite the validity of the law, measures including special operations of JBIC shall remain effective for a
considerable length of time.

**6. Various Measures Concerning USFJ Facilities and Areas**
Ensuring the stable use of the USFJ facilities and areas is essential for the achievement of the objectives of the
Japan-U.S. Security Treaty. The Government of Japan has long been implementing measures to harmonize the
stable use of these facilities and areas with requirements of the surrounding local communities.

**1. USFJ Facilities and Areas Located in Japan, Excluding Okinawa**

**(1) Iwakuni Runway Relocation Project**

In response to requests of Iwakuni City and other local
governments, the Government of Japan has decided to
proceed with the project to relocate the runway
approximately 1,000 meters to the east (offshore) in
order to ensure the stable use of Iwakuni Air Base by
solving problems related to operations, safety and
noises. The project is targeted for completion at the
end of JFY 2008. (See 4 of this section)

**(2)Realignment of USFJ Facilities and Areas**
**in Kanagawa Prefecture**

Considering that local governments concerned and

Iwakuni Air Base (runway relocation work is under way)

other organizations have strongly requested the return
of USFJ facilities and areas in Kanagawa Prefecture, the Government of Japan and the United States held
consultations on the ideal state of these facilities and areas. As a result of consultations, the two countries
reached a common understanding regarding a basic stance on the release of the six facilities and areas in
Yokohama City, including Kamiseya Communication Station, and the construction of approximately 700 units
of U.S. family housing in the Yokohama City portion of Ikego Housing Area and Navy Annex. The Japan-U.S.
Joint Committee agreed upon the result of the consultation in October 2004. (See Fig. III-2-2-16)
Of these six facilities and areas, the whole land area of Koshiba POL Depot was returned to Japan in
December 2005. As for the remaining five facilities and areas, the Ministry of Defense will be attentive to the
requirements of related local governments concerning the use of land, and will ask the United States to return
them as soon as possible.
The construction of U.S. family housing will: 1)
pave the way for the extensive return of six USFJ
facilities and areas (approximately 419ha in total) in
Kanagawa Prefecture; and 2) solve the current housing
shortage problem of U.S. Navy in Japan. In addition, it
is essential for achieving the objectives of the JapanU.S. Security Treaty. Therefore, the Ministry of
Defense is making utmost efforts to realize abovementioned housing construction through coordination

As mentioned above, USFJ facilities and areas are concentrated in Okinawa Prefecture, and this has caused
considerable impact on the lives of the residents in the prefecture. Therefore, issues related to Okinawa,
including the realignment, consolidation and reduction of USFJ facilities and areas, represent one of the most
important tasks facing the Cabinet and the Government as a whole. The Ministry of Defense, for its own part,
has so far been strongly committed to implementing a number of measures to resolve these issues, while at the
same time, harmonizing the achievement of objectives of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty with the demands of
local communities.
Of these measures, the Ministry of Defense believes that the steady implementation of the proposals set out
in the Final Report of the Special Action Committee on Okinawa (SACO), which was completed by the
Governments of Japan and the United States, would be the most reliable way to reduce the burden on the
people of Okinawa. Therefore, the Ministry of Defense is making efforts to realize the proper and rapid
implementation of such proposals. (See 4 of this section)


-----

**(1) Efforts for Realignment, Consolidation and Reduction before the Establishment of SACO**
When Okinawa was returned to Japan in 1972, the Government of Japan provided 83 facilities and areas
covering approximately 278 km[2] for exclusive use by USFJ under the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty. However,
their concentration in Okinawa has led to strong calls for their realignment and reduction on the grounds that
regional promotion and development projects are restricted and the lives of residents are seriously affected.
In view of these circumstances, both countries have continued their efforts to realign, consolidate and
reduce USFJ facilities and areas, focusing on issues that are strongly voiced by local communities. In light of
the items identified by the joint statement issued by then Prime Minister Eisaku Sato of Japan and then
President Richard Nixon of the United States in 1972, a plan for the realignment and consolidation of USFJ
facilities and areas in Okinawa was endorsed by the Security Consultative Committee (SCC) held in 1973,
1974 and 1976. It was agreed at the meeting of the Japan-U.S. Joint Committee of 1990 that both sides would
proceed with the necessary adjustments and procedures for the release of land, known as the 23 Issues.
Meanwhile, under the agreement reached at the Japan-U.S. Summit of 1995 regarding the so-called Three
Okinawa Issues (the release of Naha Port, the return of Yomitan Auxiliary Airfield, and the relocation of
artillery live-fire training over Highway 104) strongly demanded by the residents of the prefecture, it was
agreed that efforts would be made to resolve the issues. (See Reference 45)
As a result of above steps, as of January 2007, the number of USFJ facilities and areas (for exclusive use)
stood at 33, covering approximately 229 km[2], in contrast to approximately 83 (approximately 278 km[2]) at the
time of the reversion of Okinawa. However, in terms of space occupied, approximately 74% of USFJ facilities
and areas (for exclusive use) remain concentrated in Okinawa. USFJ facilities and areas (for exclusive use)
occupy approximately 10% of the land in Okinawa Prefecture and approximately 18% of the main island of
Okinawa. (See Fig. III-2-2-17)

**(2) Circumstances Surrounding the Establishment of SACO and Other Matters**
Public interest in Okinawa-related issues heightened across the country in response to an unfortunate incident
that occurred in 1995 as well as the refusal of the then Governor of Okinawa to sign land lease renewal
documents under the Special Measures Law for USFJ Land.
In the belief that the burden on the people of Okinawa should be reduced as much as possible and shared
by the whole nation, the Government has, for the sake of future development of Okinawa, decided to put even


-----

greater efforts into bringing about steady progress in the realignment, consolidation and relocation of USFJ
facilities and areas, and to do its utmost to develop measures for industrial development in Okinawa. In order to
hold consultations on issues related to USFJ facilities and areas in Okinawa, the Government established the
Okinawa Action Council between the central government and Okinawa Prefecture, and SACO between Japan
and the United States in 1995.
Since then, intense discussions have been made for about one year, and the so-called SACO Final Report
was compiled in 1996.

**(3) Overview of the SACO Final Report and Progress**
The SACO Final Report stipulates the return of land (the total return of six facilities, including Futenma Air
Station, and the partial return of five others, such as the Northern Training Area), the adjustment of training
and operational procedures (the termination of Artillery Live-Fire Training over Highway 104 and the
dispersed implementation of similar live-fire training in maneuver areas on mainland Japan), the
implementation of noise-reduction initiatives, and the improvement of operational procedures under the Status
of Forces Agreement. The land to be returned based on the SACO Final Report represents approximately 21%
(about 50 km[2]) of USFJ facilities and areas in Okinawa, exceeding the roughly 43 km[2] of land returned during
the period between the reversion of Okinawa and the implementation of the SACO Final Report.
The Government has made efforts to materialize the SACO Final Report. As a result, the return of land was
realized for the following cases: Aha Training Area, Sobe Communication Site, Yomitan Auxiliary Airfield,
and Senana Communication Station. The northern part (approximately 38ha) of Camp Kuwae was also
returned. In addition, efforts are made to realize the return of land for Northern Training Area and Gimbaru
Training Area.
It is mentioned in the Roadmap that the return of the following six candidates facilities will be examined:
MCAS Futenma, Camp Kuwae, Makiminato Service Area, Naha Port and Camp Zukeran (consolidation of
housing areas.)
As for cases other than the land return, almost all of them have been realized.
The Ministry of Defense will continue to make its maximum efforts aiming at realizing the SACO Final
Report with the understanding and support of local communities. (See Figs. III-2-2-18 • 19)

**(4) Efforts for the Use of Returned Land Used for USFJ Facilities and Areas**

On release of the land used for USFJ facilities and areas, the Ministry of Defense has taken measures to
restore vacated land to its original state by removing buildings and structures, and to provide benefits to the
owner of the land in accordance with the Special Measures Law for USFJ Land Release. Under the Special
Measures Law for Okinawa Development (enforced in 2002,) benefits are provided to the owner of large-scale
vacated land or designated vacated land.
Pursuant to the “Policy toward tasks and countermeasures per each activity field related to promotion and
facilitation of utilizing returned land used for Futenma Air Station site” formulated in December 2001, related
municipalities have been making efforts to establish returned land use plans. In February 2006, Okinawa
Prefecture and Ginowan City have established a basic policy for the use of returned land used for Futenma Air
Station.
The Ministry of Defense will continue efforts to promote and facilitate the utilization of vacated land in
coordination and cooperation with related ministries and prefectural and municipal governments.

Section 3. Policies and Measures for Enhancing Credibility of the Japan-U.S.
Security Arrangements

It is necessary to make incessant efforts to ensure the continued effectiveness, and enhance the credibility, of
the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements. The following section explains about relevant measures other than
those mentioned in the preceding section.

**1. Japan-U.S. Policy Consultation**

**1. Major Forums for Japan-U.S. Consultations on Security**
Close policy consultations on security are conducted through diplomatic channels as well as between officials
in charge of defense and foreign affairs at multiple levels of the Governments of Japan and the United States
through the Security Consultative Committee (SCC) (so-called two-plus-two meeting), the Security
Subcommittee (SSC) and the Subcommittee for Defense Cooperation (SDC) The framework of these
consultations is shown in Fig.III-2-3-1.

2. Meetings are held from time to time between working-level officials of the two Governments, such as officials corresponding in rank to vice minister or
assistant secretary.
3. A Council of Deputies consisting of Deputy-Director General and Deputy Assistant Secretaries was established when the SDC was recognized on June 28,
1996.
4. Then Director-General of the Bureau of Defense Operations was added on September 23, 1997.


-----

In addition, the Ministry of Defense organizes Japan-U.S. defense summit meetings between the Minister
of Defense of Japan and the U.S. Secretary of Defence as necessary where discussions are made with a focus
on defense policies of respective governments and defense cooperation.
Furthermore, the Ministry of Defense has held working-level meetings when necessary to exchange
information with the U.S. Department of Defense and others under the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements. The
importance of these opportunities has further increased as the Japan-U.S. defense cooperation has been
enhanced in recent years.
The sharing of information and views at every opportunity and level between Japan and the United States is
undoubtedly conducive to increased credibility of the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements, through further
enhancement of close collaboration between the two countries.
Therefore, the Ministry of Defense is proactively involved in these activities.

**2. Recent Policy Consultations between Japan and the United States**
The Japan-U.S. policy consultations (ministerial-level) conducted since 2005 are shown in Fig.III-2-3-2. On
April 30, 2007, a meeting was held among Minister of Defense Fumio Kyuma, Secretary of Defense Robert M.
Gates, Minister for Foreign Affairs Taro Aso and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, and the joint statement
titled “Alliance Transformation: Advancing United States-Japan Security and Defense Cooperation” was
announced. (See Reference 41)
The two countries conduct consultations not only at a ministerial level but also at a working level.

**(1) Japan-U.S. Defense Ministers Meeting (on April 30, 2007)**
The outline of the meeting held between Minister of Defense Kyuma and Secretary of Defense Gates is as
follows.

**a. Realignment of USFJ**
❍ Based on the shared understanding that Japan and the United States agreed on the realignment of USFJ in
order to maintain the stable presence of U.S. forces, which is indispensable to the maintenance of the peace
and stability in the Asia-Pacific region, the two countries agreed that the steady implementation of the
realignment initiatives, specified in the Roadmap announced in May 2006, in a package according to the
Japan-U.S. agreement would be important for maintaining and improving the reliability of the Japan-U.S.
alliance.

❍ In view of the above, the two countries exchanged opinions on the progress of relocation and return of
Futenma Air Station, relocation of U.S. Marine Corps in Okinawa to Guam and the return of land area south
of Kadena Air Base, and agreed that the realignment initiatives should be realized as soon as possible in
accordance with the Roadmap.

**b. Protection of Classified Information**
Sharing information is an important element in full disclosure of the case of information leakage in MSDF,
prevention of recurrence of a similar case, and enhancement of Japan-U.S. defense cooperation. The security of
shared information would be essential for further promoting information sharing. The two countries exchanged
opinions on this issue and agreed to make efforts to enhance information security in the future.

**c. F-X**
Concerning F-4 successor aircraft (so-called F-X), Minister of Defense Kyuma asked the U.S. side to cooperate
with Japan as far as possible in providing information concerning U.S.-made aircraft to be investigated.

**2. Guidelines for Japan-U.S. Defense Cooperation and Policies to Ensure their**
**Effectiveness**

**1. The Guidelines for Japan-U.S. Defense Cooperation**
In the Japan-U.S. Joint Declaration on Security announced in 1996 following changes in the security
environment after the end of the Cold War, the review of the Guidelines for Japan-U.S. Defense Cooperation[18]

was listed as one of the matters of cooperation in core areas to increase the credibility of Japan-U.S. alliance.
Accordingly, the Governments of Japan and the United States reviewed the Guidelines for Japan-U.S. Defense
Cooperation (the Former Guidelines) for the first time in approximately 20 years since its formulation in 1978,


-----

to further increase the credibility of the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements. In 1997, the new Guidelines for
Japan-U.S. Defense Cooperation (the Guidelines) were approved at the two-plus-two meeting. The following is
an outline of the Guidelines.

**(1) Objectives of the Guidelines**
The Guidelines aim to create a solid basis for more effective and reliable Japan-U.S. cooperation under normal
circumstances, in case of an armed attack against Japan and a situation in areas surrounding Japan.

**(2) Matters for Cooperation Prescribed in the Guidelines**
**a. Cooperation under Normal Circumstances**
Both governments will maintain close cooperation for the defense of Japan and for the creation of a more stable
international security environment, and will promote cooperation in various fields under normal circumstances.
Such cooperation includes information sharing and policy consultations; security dialogues and defense
exchanges; U.N. Peacekeeping Operations (PKOs) and international humanitarian operations; bilateral defense
planning and mutual cooperation planning; enhancing joint exercises and trainings; and establishing a bilateral
coordination mechanism.

**b. Actions in Response to Armed Attack against Japan**
Bilateral actions in response to an armed attack against Japan remain a core aspect of Japan-U.S. defense
cooperation. The two governments will cooperate in the following ways:
1) The SDF will primarily conduct defense operations in response to an armed attack against Japan[19], and U.S.
forces will conduct operations to supplement and support them;
2) The SDF and U.S. forces will conduct effective joint operations of their respective ground, maritime and air
units in coordination with each other. The SDF and U.S. forces will respond to air attacks, defend waters
around Japan, and counter airborne and seaborne invasions based on their respective concept of operations.
3) The SDF will have primary responsibility of check and repel unconventional attacks, including those of
guerillas or special operation forces, at the earliest possible stage, and receive appropriate support from U.S.
forces, depending on the situation. The SDF and U.S. forces will cooperate and coordinate closely to
respond to a ballistic missile attack. U.S. forces will consider, as necessary, the use of units having strike
capabilities. (See Fig. III-2-3-3)

**c. Cooperation in Situations in Areas Surrounding Japan**
The Governments of both Japan and the United States will make every effort, including diplomatic efforts, to
prevent situations in areas surrounding Japan[20] from occurring. Functions and fields of cooperation and
examples of items of cooperation in such situations are shown in Fig. III-2-3-4.

**(3) Bilateral Programs under the Guidelines**
In order to promote Japan-U.S. cooperation under the Guidelines in an effective manner and to achieve positive
results without fail, the two countries need to hold consultative dialogues throughout the spectrum of security
conditions—normal circumstances, armed attacks against Japan, and situations in areas surrounding Japan. In
addition, both sides must be well informed at various levels and undertake appropriate coordination to attain
such objectives. To that end, the two governments will strengthen their information-and intelligence-sharing
and policy consultations by taking advantage of all available opportunities, and will establish the following two
mechanisms for facilitation of consultations, policy coordination, and coordination of operations and activity
areas.


-----

**Fig. III-2-3-3 Concept of Operations When an Armed Attack against Japan Takes Place**

|Operations|Col2|Operations by Self-Defense Forces|Operations by U.S. Forces|
|---|---|---|---|
|Operations to counter the air attack against Japan||Will have primary responsibility for conducting operations for air defense|Will support SDF operations Will conduct operations, including those which may involve the use of strike power, to supplement SDF capabilities|

|Operations to counter airborne and seaborne invasions of Japan||Will have primary responsibility for conducting operations to check and repel such invasions|Will primarily conduct operations to supplement SDF capabilities The U.S. will introduce reinforcements at the earliest possible stage, according to the scale, type, and other factors of invasion, and will support SDF operations.|
|Responses to other threats|Guerrilla- commando type attacks or any other unconventional attacks involving military infiltration in Japanese territory|Will have primary responsibility to check and repel such attacks at the earliest possible stage. In its operations, the SDF will cooperate and coordinate closely with relevant agencies|Will support the SDF in appropriate ways depending on the situation|
||Ballistic missile attacks|Will cooperate and coordinate closely to respond to such attacks Will provide Japan with necessary intelligence, and Will consider, as necessary, use of forces providing additional strike power||
||||Will provide Japan with necessary intelligence, and Will consider, as necessary, use of forces providing additional strike power|



**a. Comprehensive Mechanism**
The comprehensive mechanism has been created so that not only the SDF and U.S. forces but also the relevant
agencies of the respective governments conduct bilateral works based on the Guidelines under normal
circumstances. In the comprehensive mechanism, joint work such as bilateral defense planning and mutual
cooperation planning will be conducted to respond smoothly and effectively to armed attacks against Japan and
to situations in areas surrounding Japan. (See Fig. III-2-3-5)

**b. Coordination Mechanism**
The coordination mechanism, established in 2000, is active even in normal circumstances so that the two
countries may coordinate their respective activities beforehand that will be conducted in the event of an armed
attack against Japan and in a situation in areas surrounding Japan. (See Fig. III-2-3-6)

**2. Various Policies for Ensuring the Effectiveness of the Guidelines**

**(1) Measures for ensuring the Effectiveness of the Guidelines**
In order to secure effectiveness of the Guidelines, it is important to properly take necessary measures, including
legal ones, regarding the Japan-U.S. cooperation in cases of armed attack situations and situations in areas
surrounding Japan as well as in programs under normal circumstances. From this perspective, it is necessary
for the Government of Japan as a whole to collaborate in advancing joint efforts between Japan and the United
States, including examination of bilateral defense planning and mutual cooperation planning in the Guidelines
in peacetime.

and other matters of ship inspection operations implemented by Japan in response to situations in areas
surrounding Japan. Its outline is as follows.
When the Prime Minister deems it necessary for the SDF to provide rear area support[21], rear area search and
rescue activities, or ship inspection operations, the Prime Minister must request a cabinet decision on such
activities and on a draft basic plan of response measures. The Prime Minister must obtain prior approval, or ex
post facto approval in case of emergency, from the Diet in order for the SDF to conduct response measures.
In accordance with the basic plan, the Minister of Defense will draw up an implementation guideline
(including designation of implementation areas), obtain approval for the guideline from the Prime Minister, and
give the SDF orders to conduct rear area support, rear area search and rescue activities, and ship inspection
operations.


-----

Heads of relevant administrative organizations will implement response measures and may request the
heads of local governments to provide the necessary cooperation for the organizations to exercise their
authorities in accordance with relevant laws and regulations and the basic plan. In addition, the heads of
relevant administrative organizations may request persons other than the central government to cooperate as
necessary in accordance with relevant laws and regulations and the basic plan[22].
The Prime Minister reports to the Diet without delay when the Cabinet has made a decision or approved its
revision, or when the response measures have been completed.

**(3) Rear Area Support**
Rear area support means support measures, including the provision of goods, services and conveniences, given
by Japan in rear areas to U.S. forces conducting activities that contribute to the achievement of the objectives
of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty in situations in areas surrounding Japan. (Article 3 of the Law concerning the
Measures for Peace and Safety of Japan in Situations in Areas Surrounding Japan)
In rear area support, the SDF provides goods and services, including supplies, transportation, repair,
maintenance, medical services, communications, port and harbor activities and base activities.

**(4) Rear Area Search and Rescue Activities**
Rear area search and rescue activities (including the transport of those rescued) are conducted in rear areas by
Japan in the event that participants go missing during combat operations conducted in situations in areas
surrounding Japan. (Article 3 of the Law concerning the Measures for Peace and Safety of Japan in Situations
in Areas Surrounding Japan)
In the event that noncombatants go missing, they will be searched and rescued as well. In addition, if there
are any casualties in the territorial waters of a foreign country adjacent to the implementation area in which the
SDF is conducting activities, the SDF will also rescue such casualties, after having obtained approval from that
foreign country. However, this is limited to cases in which no combat operations are conducted at that time and
are expected to be conducted in the waters throughout the period during which the SDF conducts rescue
activities.

**(5) Ship Inspection Operations**

Ship inspection operations mean such operations to
inspect and confirm the cargo and destination of ships
(excluding warships and others[23]) and to request, if
necessary, a change of sea route, or destination port or
place that are conducted by Japan in situations in areas
surrounding Japan with the purpose of strictly
enforcing the regulatory measures concerning trade or
other economic activities to which Japan is a party.
These activities are conducted based on the U.N.

**3. Japan-U.S. Joint Exercises**
Joint exercises conducted by the SDF and U.S. forces are useful for enhancing their respective tactical skills[26].
Joint exercises are also an indispensable means of facilitating mutual understanding and close communication

under normal circumstances, thereby improving interoperability and ensuring the smooth conduct of JapanU.S. bilateral actions. In addition, it is important for the SDF to conduct necessary trainings for collaboration
and coordination between the SDF and U.S. forces in normal circumstances so that the SDF may carry out the
missions conferred by the Law concerning the Measures for Peace and Safety of Japan in Situations in Areas
Surrounding Japan and other laws. Such efforts serve to maintain and enhance the credibility and deterrent
effect of the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements.
Therefore, the SDF has conducted a variety of joint exercises with U.S. forces, and maintains a policy to
enhance these exercises in the future. In February 2007, for example, a Japan-U.S. joint exercises (a command
post exercise), attended by approximately 1,350 personnel in total from the Joint Staff Office, GSDF, MSDF
and ASDF, was held to maintain and improve the bilateral joint operations capabilities. The exercises included
cooperation and coordination procedures between the three SDF forces as well as between the SDF and U.S.
forces, on the assumption that an armed attack against Japan or a situation in areas surrounding Japan has taken
place. (See Reference 43)

**4. The Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreement between Japan and the United States**
**(ACSA)**

The basic principle of the Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreement between Japan and the United States
(ACSA)[27] is that if either side requests the provision of goods or services, the other side should provide these
goods or services[28]. The Agreement is designed to positively contribute to the smooth and effective operation of
the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty and to efforts for international peace made under the leadership of the United
Nations. Its scope of application includes various occasions such as joint exercises in peacetime, U.N. PKOs,
situations in areas surrounding Japan, and armed attack situations. (See Fig. III-2-3-7)

**5. Mutual Exchanges of Equipment and Technology**
The Japan-U.S. Security Treaty obligates the two countries to cooperate with each other in maintaining and
developing their respective defense capabilities. The Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement between Japan and
the United States of America provides a framework for cooperation between the two countries by stipulating
that either government can provide the other government with equipment, materials, services, and other
support. Consistent with the principles of such cooperation, Japan must actively promote cooperation with the
United States regarding military equipment and technology, while paying due attention to the maintenance of
its own technology and production base.
In view of the progress of technological cooperation between Japan and the United States, the improvement
of technological level, and other factors, Japan decided to transfer its military technology to the United States

Significance of reciprocal provision of supplies and services


In general, supplies and services necessary for unit operations are replenished by themselves. However, in case
the units of allied nations are operating together, the reciprocal provision of supplies and services at sites
would enhance the flexibility of the operations.

despite the provisions of the Three Principles on the Armed Exports and other regulations. And, in 1983, Japan
concluded the Exchange of Notes concerning the Transfer of Military Technologies to the United States of
America[29] with the United States. In June 2006, the Governments of Japan and the United States concluded the
Exchange of Notes concerning the Transfer of Arms and Military Technologies to the United States of
America[30] to replace the foregoing Exchange of Notes. (See Part II, Chapter 2, Section 2, 5)
Under these frameworks, the Governments of Japan has decided to provide the United States with 17 items
of arms and military technology, including portable surface-to-air missile (SAM) technology and weapon
technologies related to joint technological research on BMD.
Japan and the United States consult with each other at forums such as the Systems and Technology Forum
(S&TF), which provides opportunities for exchanging opinions about military equipment and technology, and
conduct joint research and development regarding the specific projects agreed at the forums. Since 1992, the
two countries have concluded the joint project agreement, and conducted 15 joint projects thereunder, nine of
which are already completed. The Japan-U.S. cooperation in military equipment and technology is significant
for improving interoperability and reducing R&D costs and risks, and the two countries have been examining
the possibility of expanding joint research projects in the years to come. (See Fig. III-2-3-8)

**6. Measures to Ensure the Smooth Stationing of USFJ**
The stationing of USFJ forms a core of the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements and also serves as an expression
of U.S. deep commitment to Japan and the Asia-Pacific region. USFJ has contributed significantly to the peace
and stability of Japan and the Asia-Pacific region in a number of ways. Especially, their presence itself is
considered to function as a visible deterrent. Thus, the Government of Japan has already taken various
measures to ensure the smooth stationing of USFJ and enhanced the credibility of the Japan-U.S. Security
Arrangements.

**1. Cost Sharing for the Stationing of USFJ**

The cost sharing for the stationing of USFJ is important to ensure the smooth and effective implementation
of the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements. From this point of view, the Government of Japan has made efforts
as much as possible within the scope of the Status of Forces Agreement or based on the Special Measures


-----

Agreement[31], with due consideration for its financial situation and other factors. At present, the Ministry of
Defense bears the following costs as the cost sharing for the stationing of USFJ: 1) costs for the Facilities
Improvement Program for facilities and areas to be used by USFJ[32]; 2) labor costs for USFJ local employees; 3)
utility costs for official procurement by USFJ; and 4) additional costs for the relocation of USFJ training at the
request of the Japanese side (training relocation costs).
In April 2006, a new Special Measures Agreement took effect to replace the Special Measures Agreement
covering the period from JFY 2001 through JFY 2005 (the former agreement). Based on particular
circumstances that it is difficult to accurately estimate the progress of realignment of USFJ, the new Special
Measures Agreement was determined to cover a tentative period of two years, instead of a traditional period of
five years. In this Agreement, the same cost sharing framework and level as the former agreement are
maintained regarding three categories of expenditures—labor, utility, andº training relocation costs. On the
other hand, the Government of Japan, taking account of its tight financial situation, made efforts to further
retrench costs for the Facilities Improvement Program. Thus, the cost sharing for the stationing of USFJ was
constrained as a whole. As for future cost sharing for the stationing of USFJ, the Japanese government will take
appropriate actions on the cost sharing for the stationing of USFJ to ensure the smooth and efficient
management of Japan-U.S. security arrangements with due consideration given to the country’s strained public
finance and to the required overhaul of cost sharing for the stationing of USFJ in the “Basic Policies for
Economic and Fiscal Management and Structural Reform 2006” (so-called the large-boned policies), approved
at a Cabinet meeting in July. (See Fig. III-2-3-9)

**Fig. III-2-3-9 Outline of Cost Sharing for the Stationing of USFJ**

|Cost for Facilities Improvement Program|Barracks, family housing, environmental facilities, etc. have been constructed in the USFJ facilities and areas by the Japanese side since JFY 1979 and furnished to USFJ|Within the framework of the Status of Forces Agreement|

|Utility Costs|Fee or charge for electricity, gas, water supply, sewerage and fuels (for heating, cooking or hot water supply) have been borne by the Japanese side since JFY 1991. (By gradually increasing the costs borne by the Japanese side, the total amount have been borned within the scope of the upper limit of the procured quantity since JFY1995.)|Special Measures Agreement (JFY 1991)|
||The upper limit of the procured quantity provided in the Special Measures Agreement (JFY 1996) have been cut by 10% after subtracting the quantity of the off-base U.S. residential housing since JFY 2001.|Special Measures Agreement (JFY 2001)|
|Training Relocation Costs|Additionally necessary costs incident to the relocation of the training requested by the Japanese side have been borne by the Japanese side since JFY 1996.|Special Measures Agreement (JFY 1996)|



Besides the cost sharing for the stationing of USFJ, the Government of Japan bears costs needed for
providing USFJ facilities and areas (rental fee for the facilities and others), takes measures to improve the
living environment in the surrounding areas of these facilities and areas, and devises relief measures for


-----

unemployment of USFJ local employees. Base subsidy[33] and others are provided to the municipalities as a
substitute for fixed property tax. (See Fig. III-2-3-10)

**2. Ensuring the Stable Use of USFJ Facilities and Areas**

Note: Numbers in [ ] represent the relative composition within the whole.

The Government has concluded lease contracts with owners of private and public land on which these facilities
and areas exist in order to ensure the stable use of the necessary U.S. facilities and areas. However, should the
Government be unable to obtain the approval of owners of land, it will acquire a title[34] under the Special
Measures Law for USFJ Land[35].
In addition, the Government of Japan has been promoting various measures concerning USFJ facilities and
areas in order to achieve the objectives of the Japan-U.S. Security and satisfy demands from the local
communities around USFJ facilities and areas. (See 6 of Section 2)
Furthermore, incidents and accidents caused by U.S. service members and others[36] have affected local
residents in the surrounding areas of USFJ facilities and areas.
The Government of Japan has requested USFJ to take effective steps for the prevention of recurrence, such
as educating personnel and enforcing strict discipline among them, and has cooperated in such steps. The
Government of Japan has also taken measures for prompt and appropriate compensation for the damage caused
by such incidents and accidents.

**3. Efforts to Preserve the Environment Surrounding USFJ Facilities and Areas**
Concerning environmental issues surrounding USFJ facilities and areas, at the two-plus-two meeting held in
September 2000, the Governments of Japan and the United States, in recognition of the importance of
environmental protection associated with USFJ facilities and areas, reached an agreement on a common goal of
ensuring the health and safety of local residents around USFJ facilities and areas, U.S. forces personnel and
their dependents, and announced the Joint Statement of Environmental Principles[37]. In order to follow up this
statement, Japan-U.S. consultations have been more frequently held. Specifically, related ministries and


-----

agencies have been engaged in discussions regarding strengthened cooperation at the time of periodic reviews
of the Japan Environmental Governing Standards (JEGS)[38], exchange of environmental information, and
response to environmental contamination in collaboration with each other. In addition, at the two-plus-two
meeting held in May 2006, the two countries confirmed the importance of improved implementation of the
Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA), including proper attention to the environment.
Since September 2006, the officials of Japan and the United States have held working level meetings on
disaster prevention and safety measures for nuclear aircraft carriers, and conducted meetings on scenarios of
disaster prevention drills, a mutual assistance agreement and other matters, in preparation for a switchover to
nuclear aircraft carrier that is scheduled to take place in 2008.

Aloha!
The State of Hawaii has population of about 1.24
million on eight islands, with the total area being
slightly smaller than Shikoku Island. Hawaii is often
called “paradise” for its crystal blue sky and sea, and
visited by many Japanese tourists.
The U.S. Pacific Command Headquarters as well
as its subordinate Army Pacific Headquarters, Pacific
Fleet Headquarters, Pacific Air Force Headquarters,
Marine Forces Pacific Headquarters and other forces,
which are in charge of the largest area of all the U.S.
joint forces (about 50% of the earth, 43 countries

Colonel Yamada (left) receiving training in the U.S. army in Hawaii

from the U.S. west coast to the African east coast),
are located on the Oahu Island, and about 22% of the land of the island is used by these forces. The State
of Hawaii is also home for about 93,000 soldiers, paramilitary personnel and their families, indicating its
strong connection with the forces. The Japan Self-Defense Forces have sent four officers to Hawaii in
exchange for U.S. officers dispatched to the SDF, with one each from the Joint Staff Office to the U.S.
Pacific Command Headquarters, from the Maritime Staff Office to the U.S. Pacific Fleet Headquarters,
from the Air Staff Office to the Pacific Air Force Headquarters, and from the Air Self-Defense Force to
the Pacific Air Force Headquarters.
The duties of the U.S. Pacific Command Headquarters Liaison Officer include the liaison and
coordination between the Joint Staff Office and the U.S. Pacific Command Headquarters as well as the
coordination and support for visitors from the Joint Staff Office. The U.S. forces often use the Internet,
and because I perform most of my duties through e-mail. I do not have many opportunities to directly see
and coordinate with U.S. side personnel. However, since personal relationships are important to smoothen
liaison and coordination work, I am trying to see as many people as possible by, for example, participating


-----

in events. I am also careful about my own health and safety so as not to become injured or ill because I am
working alone.
In connection with international peace cooperation activities that became a primary mission of the
SDF in January this year, my duties also include liaison and coordination at the time when a disaster, such
as the Indian Ocean tsunami disaster in 2004, occurs. The Hawaii Island Earthquake in October last year
caused a cut-off of power and water supply on Oahu Island. Although I could not use my TV, I managed
to collect information on damages using a radio and check how the U.S. Pacific Command was
responding to the disaster, and promptly notified the details to the Joint Staff Office by phone.
The collaboration between the Joint Staff Office and the U.S. Pacific Command Headquarters has
been becoming increasingly important particularly since the SDF’s transition to a new joint operations
posture in March last year. I continue to work hard every day with the importance of my mission as a
liaison officer in mind so that I can contribute to further strengthening the relationships between the two
forces.

Section 1. Efforts to Support International Peace Cooperation Activities

The present international community faces a range of global-scale problems, from international terrorism,
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, complex and various conflicts to international crimes.
Globalization has raised concerns that the occurrence of events even in regions far from Japan will pose a
threat to our country or have an impact on the country.
In light of the difficulty for a single country to respond to and solve these global threats and the need to
take an approach to addressing these threats not only on the military front but also on various other fronts, it is
widely recognized that the international community should join hands in coping with these threats.
Along with national defense, Japan’s defense and security goals set under the National Defense Program
Guidelines (NDPG) are to improve the international security environment, based on the efforts made by the
international society, so as to reduce the chances that any threats will reach Japan. The NDPG also calls for
Japan to promote diplomatic efforts including the use of Official Development Assistance (ODA), and,
together with such diplomatic efforts, promote activities that nations of the world cooperatively undertake to
enhance the international security environment (hereinafter referred to as “international peace cooperation
activities”) so that Japan can deal with these issues proactively and on its own initiative.
Upon the transition of the Defense Agency to the
Ministry of Defense in January this year, missions of
the Self-Defense Forces (SDF) were reviewed and its
international peace cooperation activities have been
stipulated as a primary mission. (See Part II, Chapter
3, Section 2)
This chapter will explain in detail Japan’s
international peace cooperation activities and efforts
being undertaken by the Defense Ministry and the
SDF on such activities on the basis of the NDPG. (See

**1. Efforts to Support International Peace Cooperation Activities Proactively and on Its**
**Own Initiative**

**1. History of Japan’s Efforts to Support International Peace Cooperation Activities**
The Persian Gulf War was an event that became a major turning point for Japan’s efforts to support
international peace cooperation activities because it made Japan recognize the need to promote international
cooperation on the military front. The SDF dispatched a minesweeping unit of the Maritime Self-Defense
Force (MSDF) to the Persian Gulf in 1991 to ensure safe passage by Japanese vessels. The dispatch was
significant because it marked Japan’s international contribution on the personnel front through providing
peaceful and humanitarian support for the reconstruction of countries affected by the war. In 1992, the
International Peace Cooperation Law[1] was enacted, leading Japan to send Ground Self-Defense Force (GSDF)
personnel to Cambodia in September in the same year as the country’s first participation in U.N. peacekeeping
operations. Since then, the Defense Ministry and the SDF have participated in various international peace
cooperation activities in order to improve the international security environment.
The September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States led to the enactment of the Anti-Terrorism
Special Measures Law[2]. Based on this law, the SDF has been maintaining cooperation and support activities in
the Indian Ocean and other places. In 2003, Japan enacted the Law Concerning Special Measures on

**2. Reviewing the positioning of SDF’s International Peace Cooperation Activities**
The SDF has participated in various international peace cooperation activities and steadily accumulated its
experience and achievements, which have raised expectations and evaluation toward the SDF’s such activities
both at home and abroad. Under the new security environment, it is recognized that peace and stability of the
international community are closely connected to Japan’s peace and security.
In order for the SDF to engage in international peace cooperation activities more proactively and on its own
initiative under this recognition, it needs to improve various infrastructures and systems concerning its
operations. As part of efforts[4] to international peace cooperation activities have become stipulated as a primary
mission of the SDF.
With international peace cooperation activities becoming the SDF’s primary mission, Japan has become
able to send a strong message both at home and abroad that Japan has been committed to promoting peace and
stability of the international community. In addition, the SDF has been able to establish a framework in which
its members who have been executing their missions despite difficult work conditions and a tense atmosphere
while being away from their home country and living separately from their family members for a long time can
focus on executing these missions while maintaining further pride and self-awareness. (See Part II, Chapter 3,
Section 2)

2. In cases such as when the Diet is closed, an approval shall be asked for promptly in the Diet being first summoned thereafter.

**3. Establishing the System to Adequately Undertake International Peace Cooperation Activities**
Under the NDPG, the SDF, in order to appropriately undertake international peace cooperation activities, is to
improve its educational and training systems, unit stand-by postures, and its transportation capabilities. By
doing so, the SDF is to establish the foundation in which units can be dispatched expeditiously and continuous
SDF operations become possible.
In March this year, the GSDF set up the Central Readiness Force and placed under it the International
Peace Cooperation Activities Training Unit. This unit is to provide its members with education for international
peace cooperation activities in peacetime and train officers who are to become key members in future missions.
Furthermore, the unit is designed to support training for international peace cooperation activities and study
relevant issues.
In addition, the SDF will designate regional armies whose personnel are to be dispatched on a rotational
basis, and will continue to improve defense equipment and outfits which are expected to contribute to Japan’s
international peace cooperation activities and aircraft and vessels which have large transportation capacity.
These efforts are designed for the SDF to build an infrastructure or system in which Japan’s international peace
cooperation activities can be implemented more effectively.


-----

Moreover, the SDF plans to set up the Central Readiness Regiment (tentatively named) under the Central
Readiness Force at the end of the current fiscal year. The regiment is expected to boost the SDF’s ability to
respond to contingencies expeditiously and appropriately. The Central Readiness Regiment (tentatively named)
is to assume the role of going to a dispatch area as an advance unit and engage in works to pave the way for
smooth operations by other units which are to be dispatched later soon after Japan decides to participate in
international peace cooperation activities. Because of this regiment, Japan can strengthen a framework in which
the country can respond to the need for its participation in international peace cooperation activities
expeditiously and appropriately.

**4. Welfare and Mental Health Care of Dispatched SDF Personnel**
It is extremely important to improve the working environment for the dispatched SDF personnel, who are
supposed to fulfill their assigned duty under severe working conditions while being far away from their home
country and families, so that they can fulfill such duty smoothly while maintaining their health both physically
and mentally.
The Defense Ministry and the SDF have taken various measures to ease anxiety of SDF members being
dispatched overseas for participation in international peace cooperation activities and their families back in
Japan so that the members can devote themselves to undertaking assigned work without worrying about the
families.
For example, welfare services are provided to the dispatched SDF members to help them maintain close
bonds with families in Japan. Specifically, direct communication between the dispatched SDF members and
their families in Japan are ensured via international phone calls, TV telephones, e-mail and other services.
Moreover, the SDF members and their families can exchange video correspondence. In Japan, briefing sessions
for families of the dispatched members have been held to provide them with necessary information while
family support centers and family counseling rooms have been set up to reply to all kinds of questions raised
by the families.
The SDF offers mental health-care services for SDF members soon to be dispatched overseas. These
members take a short course in Japan on how to reduce stress. While engaging in overseas assignment,
dispatched SDF members can consult other SDF members who have been designated as counselors after
undergoing counseling training. Such counselors are to provide the dispatched members with sufficient mental
care. In addition, medical officers accompany the SDF units on overseas missions. Under certain situations, the
Defense Ministry is prepared to send psychiatrists with professional medical knowledge to the SDF units
undertaking overseas missions while having some of the dispatched personnel return home for full treatment.
(See Chapter 4, Section 1)

**2. Cooperation in Global Efforts to Reconstruct Iraq**

**1. Details about Japan’s efforts to support Iraqi reconstruction and significance**
Major combat operations have ended in Iraq, and the international community is redoubling its efforts to help
rebuild the country, following the adoption of U.N. Security Council Resolution 1483[5] and subsequent
resolutions since May 2003. The reconstruction of Iraq is extremely important for ensuring peace and security
in the global community including Japan, as well as for attaining peace and stability for the Iraqi people and the
Middle East. Japan started dispatching SDF units to the Middle Eastern countries in December 2003 based on
the Law Concerning Special Measures on Humanitarian and Reconstruction Assistance in Iraq, approved in the
Diet in July of the same year. The dispatched SDF units have conducted operations for humanitarian assistance
in cooperation with support provided by Official Development Assistance (ODA).
The SDF units have been also assisting troops of foreign countries in their efforts to restore security and
stability in Iraq to the degree that would not hamper the units’ activities for humanitarian and reconstruction
assistance.


-----

These cooperation activities by Japan can play a
role in preventing Iraq from becoming a hotbed of
terrorism and helping the country to rebuild itself so
that it can become a peaceful, democratic and
responsible country, paving the foundation for Japan
and Iraq to establish favorable relations in the future.
In addition, they are not only instrumental in
stabilizing the overall Middle East but also are
extremely important for Japan because the situation in
the Middle East region directly affects the prosperity
and stability of Japan, which relies on the region for Prime Minister Koizumi (then) delivers speech at ceremony to return flag by

activities in Iraq after end of their mission

Japan’s humanitarian contribution to the activities
along with the United States for the reconstruction of Iraq has further cemented the relationship of mutual
confidence between Japan and the United States, helping to strengthen their bilateral security alliance.
Japan’s support to help rebuild Iraq have won acclaim both from the international community and the Iraqi
people as playing a significant role in not only achieving closer and more effective security cooperation
between Japan and the United States, but also enhancing trust in Japan by the global community.

**Assistance in Iraq and the Basic Plan**

**(1) Outline of the Law Concerning Special Measures on Humanitarian and Reconstruction**
**Assistance in Iraq**

The international community has been engaged in efforts to improve the welfare of the Iraqi people, and
support and promote Iraqi own initiative for the swift reconstruction of Iraq, following the use of force against
Iraq by some U.N. member countries in March 2003 based on U.N. Security Council Resolutions.
The Law Concerning Special Measures on Humanitarian and Reconstruction Assistance in Iraq, or the Iraq
Special Measures Law, is intended to allow Japan to implement activities for humanitarian and reconstruction
assistance and support activities for ensuring security in line with U.N. Security Council Resolution 1483 and
others. It is also designed for Japan to contribute proactively and on its own initiative to global efforts for the
reconstruction of Iraq in order to promote the peace and stability of the international community, including
Japan.
This legislation is a temporary law as it will expire four years after its enforcement. But it can be extended
for up to four years by enacting a separate law if such extension is deemed necessary. As the current law is set
to expire on July 31, 2007, the Government judged that Japan needs to provide continued support to Iraqi
reconstruction efforts on its own initiative given such efforts in the coming several years will hold a key to the
success of nation-building in Iraq. Based on the judgment, the Diet enacted in June this year legislation that can
extend the validity of the current law for an additional two years through July 31, 2009. (See Fig. III-3-1-3)

**(2) Outline of the Basic Plan**
The Basic Plan stipulated basic policies, kinds of aid activities, their contents, the scope of areas where such
activities are undertaken, and others regarding response measures Japan is to take in line with the Law
Concerning Special Measures on Humanitarian and Reconstruction Assistance in Iraq. The Government judged
it necessary for Japan to conduct activities commensurate to its international status in order to fulfill its

responsibility in the international community, and the Cabinet approved the Basic Plan in December 2003. (See
Reference 47)
The Basic Plan at first stipulated that SDF troops be dispatched to Iraq for up to one year. But Japan, acting
on its independent judgment based on the Iraqi situation, revised the Basic Plan a total of seven times in order
to extend the duration of the SDF’s humanitarian activities in Iraq, withdraw GSDF units from the country and
have the Air Self-Defense Force (ASDF) engage in a mission to support U.N. operations.
In December last year, the Basic Plan was revised and the duration of Japan’s reconstruction mission in
Iraq was extended until July 31 this year when the Law Concerning Special Measures on Humanitarian and
Reconstruction Assistance in Iraq expires. The revised Basic Plan also deleted reference to a GSDF rearsupport unit which had been operating in Kuwait to assist the redeployment of main GSDF units for Iraqi
reconstruction from the country as they returned home on September 9 last year.
With the current Basic Plan set to expire on July 31 this year, Japan plans to revise it again, marking the
eighth revision. (See Fig. III-3-1-4)

**3. SDF Operations**
The SDF had undertaken international peace cooperation activities to help Iraqi refugees and people who
suffered as a result of the war before the enactment of the Law Concerning Special Measures on Humanitarian
and Reconstruction Assistance in Iraq. Since December 2003, GSDF and ASDF units, based on the Iraq
Special Measures Law, have provided humanitarian and reconstruction support to the country, such as
restoration and improvement of public facilities, and transportation of personnel and aid materials, for local
people facing the hardship, which contributed to global efforts to help Iraq rebuild its country on its own
initiative.
Japan’s aid mission to Iraq consists of humanitarian contribution led by the SDF and the Government’s
Official Development Assistance (ODA) which is under jurisdiction of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, both of
which support each other in tandem. Japan’s such efforts to support Iraq, having produced visible results, have
won high acclaim from the international community, including Iraq.

In June last year, the Government of Japan, judging that reconstruction in Muthanna Province effectively
advanced from the stage where quick support measures are necessary to the stage where its people can rebuild
their country on their own, decided to have GSDF units pull out of Iraq.
Meanwhile, an ASDF squadron has been still undertaking Iraqi aid operations, providing airlifting support
to the United Nations in response to such a request from the U.N. Secretary-General and continuing to provide
similar support to the multilateral force.

**(1) Activities of ASDF Units**
Starting in December 2003, the ASDF’s airlift squadrons, each consisting of three C-130H transport planes and
about 200 personnel, have been dispatched for Japan’s Iraqi reconstruction operations. Since March 2004, the
C-130H planes have airlifted goods and materials donated by Japan for humanitarian and reconstruction use,
including medical equipment, similar goods donated by other countries and relevant international
organizations, and personnel dispatched by such countries and organizations as well as replenishing supplies
being used by the dispatched GSDF units.
In April 2004, the airlift squadron transported 10 Japanese media correspondents posted in Samawah to cover
the GSDF activities there from Talill Airport in Iraq to Al Mubarak Air Base in Kuwait, marking the first
transport of Japanese nationals by the SDF under
Article 84-3 of the SDF Law (previously Article 100-8).
Even after the withdrawal of the GSDF from Iraq,
the ASDF, meeting needs from the United Nations and
the multinational force, continues to cooperate in
global efforts for Iraqi reconstruction and stability,
providing support to the United Nations and the
multinational force by, for instance, airlifting goods to
Baghdad and Erbil, where U.N. operations are
underway. As of May 10 this year, airlifting operations
conducted by the ASDF for the Iraqi mission totaled

505 times with the total goods and materials transported weighing 524 tons.

**(2) Dispatch of Liaison Officers**
The SDF has dispatched[6] liaison and other officers to the U.S. Central Command in Florida, the United States,
and the headquarters of the multinational force in Baghdad to gather information deemed necessary for SDF
operations being undertaken under the Law Concerning Special Measures on Humanitarian and Reconstruction
Assistance in Iraq and Anti-Terrorism Special Measures Law, and make various coordination with the U.S.
Central Command or the multinational force. The Liaison and other SDF officers being dispatched there have
collected information in areas where SDF units are operating and engaged in coordination work regarding
acceptance of SDF personnel and supplies, and goods procurements and their transportation. Activities by these
liaison officers have contributed to smooth and efficient operations of SDF units being assigned to the Iraqi
reconstruction missions. At present, the Joint Staff Office has dispatched liaison officers to the U.S. Central
Command in Florida. Moreover, the ASDF has dispatched a liaison team to the headquarters of the
multinational force in Baghdad.

**(3) Withdrawal of GSDF Units**
On June 20 last year, the Government of Japan judged that the reconstruction stage in which quick support
measures were necessary has basically ended in Muthanna Province, both on the rehabilitation and security
fronts. The GOJ, judging that GSDF units being dispatched to Iraq have achieved their initial objective of
supporting reconstruction efforts by the Iraqi people in collaboration with the international community, decided
to have the units withdraw from the province.
Following the decision, the then Defense Agency
and the SDF dispatched a rear-support unit[7] of about
100 GSDF members to Samawah and Kuwait on June
27 last year to have it undertake operations to support
the withdrawal of GSDF units from Iraq, including
coordination for transportation-related work. The unit
then began such rear-support operations there. The
10th SDF contingent for Iraqi reconstruction returned
home on July 25, 2006 and the rear-support unit on
September 9 in the same year, marking the end of the
GSDF’s operation in Iraq that lasted for about two and

GSDF defense equipment being loaded into private transport vehicle for
withdrawal from Iraq half years. (See Fig. III-3-1-5)

**a. Activities of GSDF units in Muthanna Province**
GSDF units undertook reconstruction operations in Samawah for about two and half years, such as restoration
and establishment of medical services, water-supply systems and public facilities, since the First contingent for
Iraqi relief and reconstruction mission and the First unit for supporting Iraqi reconstruction were dispatched.
A total of about 5,600 GSDF members participated in humanitarian and reconstruction support activities,
including restoration and establishment of medical services, water-supply systems, schools and other public
facilities, in Iraq between their first dispatch to the country and the period of withdrawal, and have made
achievements in various fields, improving life-related infrastructure and creating jobs for people living in
Muthanna Province.

**(currently the 401st Squadron of the 1st Transport Wing)**

It was the support from my family that made it possible
for me to go to the Middle East, leaving my two-year-old
son behind. Some of the colleagues in my squadron have
been sent to Iraq four times, and I think it is also thanks to
the support of their family. The mission in Iraq made me
realize it, and I am feeling immensely grateful to my
family.
During the mission, I worked as a copilot of a C-130H
air carrier, and supported the captain by monitoring a
threat during flight, communicating with air traffic
controllers, and through other duties. The crew was
always working in a tense atmosphere, but because we
had received sufficient training while in Japan, we were Captain Higuchi rejoiced to see her son for the first time in fourmonths
all confident that we can deal with any emergency
situation.
The captain, as the leader of the crew, was paying attention to every risk he could think of and
concentrating all his nerves on the securing of safety of his crew. His physical and metal burdens were
therefore tremendous. I, as the copilot, made utmost efforts to alleviate his burdens. My next goal is to
become a captain pilot and lead my crew to play an active role in international peace cooperation
activities—with again the support from my son (who will be a little older by then) and family!

The first thing I noticed when I landed on the desert
country was its unbelievable heat. The four months in Iraq
were full of unique experiences I could not have had in
Japan. The temperature began to rise immediately after the
sun rose and exceeded 40°C Sandstorms were so severe
that there were even times when I could not see a thing
only five meters away and was almost lost in the desert.
As a member of the Engineering Platoon, my duties
were to regularly check, repair and maintain the buildings
and other facilities as well as roads around them. There
were rain leaks almost everywhere (!) including offices
and quarters. If we leave even the slightest gap open, the
room will be covered with sand almost instantly. Since

there were PCs and other electric equipment in the offices, we needed to pay particular attention to gaps in
the doors of the offices to completely shut out sand. The sand in the Middle East is as fine as dust. In
addition, because there were no shovel loaders or dump trucks, we had to carry materials manually or by
using wheel barrows while soaked with sweat. Physical strength mattered most there. We understood the
importance of a physical examination we had received in Japan before the mission.
The assignment at the very forefront of the international contribution was a very meaningful
experience. I want to take part again if I have a chance.

With the recognition that the Iraqi people should play a major role in reconstructing their country, members
of GSDF units being dispatched to Iraq always paid their respects to the Iraqi people, and tried to engage in aid
activities in a sincere manner while standing on the same place as they are standing. With their reconstruction
activities winning trust and support from local people, the GSDF members were able to end their mission,
without anyone of them being hurt physically. (See Fig. III-3-1-6)

**b. Factors behind effective implementation of humanitarian and reconstruction support**

GSDF units and their humanitarian and reconstruction support activities in Iraq have received very high
acclaim both at home and abroad, including from the Iraqi government hosting the GSDF’s such activities, and
also have received support from many Japanese people. Behind the successful GSDF activities in Iraq was

fostered through their day-after-day hard training, and lesson learned by
them through the past participation in various international peace
cooperation activities.
Following are factors which have been believed to be behind the
effective implementation of humanitarian and reconstruction support
activities in Iraq by the GSDF members.
1) Was able to grasp the local situation and local needs promptly and
accurately and having appropriately chosen a region where GSDF units
would be dispatched for humanitarian and reconstruction support
activities
2) Was able to provide effective support to meet needs of local people by
combining humanitarian contribution by the SDF with the Japanese
Government’s ODA support

and Reconstruction Assistance by the Ground SelfDefense Force in Iraq that had lasted for two and a
half years, the Iraq Evacuation Support Group was
sent to Kuwait and Samawah in Iraq as a unit to
“close the column” with the mission to send back to
Japan about 200 vehicles and 100,000 equipment
(about 600 containers in total) used for the Iraq
reconstruction support activities. For this
evacuation operation, we used the private transport
sector wherever possible by hiring local workers. Lieutenant Colonel Mochizuki explaining the evacuation flow to Foreign
Although the operation did not proceed smoothly at Minister Aso in Kuwait
the beginning due to the difference in language and
customs, we and the local workers could gradually establish communication, and by the time all the
equipment had been loaded into containers and all the vehicles had been washed through mutual
cooperation, everyone at the site could feel a sense of unity regardless of the nationality.
Although the evacuation operation was initially planned to commence in a cooler season, it actually
began in the hottest season. The temperature was above 50°C during the daytime every day, and
occasional severe sand storms relentlessly covered the just washed vehicles with sand. Despite all these
adverse conditions, we completed the large-scale three-month evacuation operation. The working
environment was harsh, and the work such as servicing and washing equipment and vehicles tended to be
somewhat monotonous, but each member was determined to finish this final mission of the Iraq
reconstruction support activities with success. Every member was working very carefully not to cause any
accident and not to spoil the success of the SDF contingent for the Iraqi relief and reconstruction mission.
Thanks to these efforts, we were able to fulfill the mission without any accident or injury. I believe that
every member is pleased that they could take part in the final operation of, and contribute to, the Iraq
reconstruction support activities, and has gained great confidence and pride.

In January this year, international peace cooperation activities of the SDF were positioned as one of its
primary missions. The Defense Ministry and the SDF have pledged to commit themselves to such activities
proactively and on their own initiative. In this sense, achievements they have made through their experience in
the Iraqi reconstruction mission were significant. (See Part II, Chapter 3, Section 1)

**4. Evaluation of Japan’s Efforts by Other Countries**
Japan’s activities in the rebuilding of Iraq have won acclaim and gratitude from Iraq and other countries, as
mentioned below. A public opinion poll conducted on local people showed that about 70% of those polled
supported the Japanese operations.

**(1) Evaluation in Iraq**
In June last year, shortly after Japan’s decision to withdraw the GSDF from Iraq, Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri alMaliki talked with then Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi over the phone and said he wanted to
express deep gratitude for the SDF’s activities in Iraq and Japan’s support of Iraq on behalf of the Government
of Iraq. The Iraqi Prime Minister also said the SDF activities in Iraq left a favorable impression about Japan
among the Iraqi people.
In his letter addressed to Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on March 12 this year, Iraqi Prime Minister
al-Maliki said airlifting activities by Japan’s ASDF for the United Nations and the multinational force have
been playing a major and vital role for Iraq’s efforts to promote reconstruction and nation-rebuilding. In the
letter, the Iraqi Prime Minister also requested Japan to consider renewing its support activities in Iraq. During
his visit to Japan in April, Prime Minister al-Maliki commended the ASDF’s airlifting activities as encouraging
to Iraqi people and expressed gratitude for Japan’s contribution to rebuilding Iraq.
Results of a public survey conducted in 2006 on people in Samawah regarding the SDF’s activities around
the city are shown in Fig. III-3-1-7.

**(2) Evaluation by the United Nations**
In a letter delivered to Japanese Prime Minister Abe in March this year, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki Moon
expressed gratitude for Japan’s airlifting operations saying the airlift service has been of particular importance
to supporting UNAMI’s Area Office in Erbil.
Ashraf Qazi, the Secretary-General’s Special Representative in Iraq, in a letter to the Japanese Acting
Ambassador to Iraq, appreciated the ASDF’s airlift operations and asked for Japan to continue to engage in the
operations.


-----

**(3) Evaluation in Other Countries**
U.S. President George W. Bush thanked then Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi during their summit
meeting in June last year for Japan’s humanitarian reconstruction assistance efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan,
and for Japan’s support to forces of various countries operating in the Indian Ocean.
Meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice visited Japan in July 2004 and highly commended
Japan for its contribution to rebuilding Iraq and Afghanistan. Rice also said Japan’s assistance in Iraq has
wonderfully supported the Iraqi people.
During the Japan-U.S. defense chiefs’ meeting in January last year between then U.S. Defense Secretary
Donald Rumsfeld and then Japanese Minister of State for Defense Fukushiro Nukaga, Rumsfeld highly
appreciated Japan’s past efforts to rebuild Iraq. Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Sultan Bin Abdul Aziz, who also
serves as Inspector General and Minister of Defense and Aviation, meeting with then Japanese Prime Minister
Koizumi in April last year, highly valued Japan’s efforts to reconstruct and stabilize Iraq and expressed
gratitude for its contribution in the country.

**3. Activities Responding to International Terrorism**

**1. Efforts of International Community**
Since the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States, the international community has been
fighting against terrorism not only on military but also on diplomatic, police, judicial, intelligence and
economic fronts. But the threat of terrorist attacks has continued to exist in the global community in view of the
outbreak in various parts of the world of a series of suspected terrorist acts[8] by international terrorist
organizations including Al Qaeda. Against this background, the global community needs to continue a longterm battle in a concerted manner in order to eradicate terrorism.
Strongholds of terrorist groups like Al Qaeda are said to exist in the national border between Afghanistan
and Pakistan. As Afghanistan has continued to serve as a production center for narcotics, a major funding
source for terrorists, the U.S. military and others have been campaigning to combat terrorism in the region
under Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF). (See Fig. III 3-1-8)
About 20 countries have dispatched their troops to Afghanistan to have them take part in the U.S.-led
operation in an attempt to stamp out terrorists in the region. But some groups suspected of being linked with
terrorist organizations and of involvement in smuggling of narcotics and weapons are believed to have escaped
the region and moved to the sea via mountainous areas. These groups, using vessels, are believed to have
already moved to wider areas like the Middle East, Africa, Europe or Southeast Asia and seen to be engaging
in terrorist activities there.
The international community has been engaged in
Operating Enduring Freedom-Maritime Interdiction
Operation (OEF-MIO) in the Indian Ocean in a bid to
block and deter terrorists from moving and prevent the
proliferation of weapons, ammunition and narcotics,
using marine routes. At present, warships of U.S.,
European, Pakistani and other countries have been
operating there in order to undertake MIO activities.
MIO has already generated results with some of
these warships detecting and confiscating a large
amount of drugs, guns and portable anti-tank rockets

country from again becoming a hotbed of terrorism.

**2. Japan’s Efforts in Combating Terrorism**
At a time when the international community has been united in fighting against terrorism, it is necessary for
Japan to reinforce its efforts to combat terrorism as well in collaboration with other countries. Based on this
idea, Japan is making anti-terrorism efforts[10] on various fronts.
Activities by the SDF to support the international anti-terrorism campaign in line with the Anti-Terrorism
Special Measures Law have contributed to the peace and security of the international community, including
Japan, enabling Japan to fulfill a role commensurate to its status in the international society and increasing
confidence in Japan by the international community and also in making Japan-U.S. cooperation in security
even more close and effective.
Specifically, soon after the terrorist attacks took place in the United States on September 11, 2001, Japan
came to perceive the fight against international terrorism as its own task, and clarified its position that it would
make a positive and independent contribution to world efforts to prevent and eradicate terrorism. In October
2001, the Anti-Terrorism Special Measures Law was enacted. Following the enforcement of the law, the
MSDF has conducted cooperation and support activities, refueling naval vessels of the United States and other
nations operating in the Indian Ocean. Meanwhile, the ASDF has been also continuing cooperation and support
activities by airlifting goods and supplies of the U.S. military.
These activities by Japan’s SDF have won high acclaim from the international community including the
United States as paving the foundation for activities being undertaken by worships of many countries to block
and deter terrorists, weapons and ammunition from moving using marine routes.


-----

**3. Outline of the Anti-Terrorism Special Measures Law and the Basic Plan**

**(1) Outline of the Anti-Terrorism Special Measures Law**
The purpose of the Anti-Terrorism Special Measures Law is to specify the following measures in order for
Japan to contribute actively and on its own initiative to the efforts of the international community to prevent
and eradicate international terrorism, thereby ensuring the peace and security of the international community,
including that of Japan.
1) The measures Japan implements in support of the activities of the U.S. Armed Forces and other foreign
forces are aimed at eradicating the threat being posed by the 9/11 terrorist attacks, thereby contributing to
achieving the purposes of the U.N. Charter, and procedures and other necessary actions for implementing
these measures.
2) The measures Japan implements from a humanitarian point of view based on U.N. resolutions or requests
made by the United Nations and other international organizations, and procedures and other necessary
actions for implementing these measures.

Notes: 1. Provision of materials will not include weapons (including ammunition).
2. Provision of goods and services will not include fueling and maintenance of aircraft
which are in preparation for combating.
3. Transportation of goods will not include land transportation of weapons (including
ammunition) in foreign territory.


-----

Activities that can be conducted by the SDF under the Anti-Terrorism Special Measures Law are 1)
cooperation and support activities[11], 2) search and rescue activities[12] and 3) activities[13] to assist people affected
by terrorist acts. The types of materials and services to be provided by the SDF as part of its cooperation and
support activities (including activities to support search and rescue operations by militaries of foreign
countries) are shown in Fig. III-3-1-9.
The Anti-Terrorism Special Measures Law is a temporary law, expiring two years from the date of its
enactment. If deemed necessary, however, its effect can be extended by up to two years by a separate law.
Furthermore, the Government judged it necessary for Japan to continue making efforts on its own initiative
to eradicate terrorist activities in view of the global community’s continuing battle against terrorism. Based on
this judgment, the Government has presented a bill to extend the effect of the Anti-Terrorism Special Measures
Law to the Diet for three times. Each time, the bill was enacted by the Diet. After the latest extension, the
effect of the law is to last until November 1 this year.

**(2) Outline of the Basic Plan**
The Basic Plan stipulated basic policies regarding response measures Japan is to take in line with the AntiTerrorism Special Measures Law, kinds of aid activities, their contents, the scope of areas where such activities
are undertaken, and others.
In light of the situation surrounding anti-terrorist activities being undertaken by various countries in the
Indian Ocean, the Government judged it necessary for Japan to maintain its cooperation and support activities.
In April this year, the Government changed the Basic Plan to extend the duration of SDF dispatch for such
activities, marking its 11th revision. (See Fig. III-3-1-10) (See Reference 49)

|Search and Rescue Activities|SDF troops are supposed to engage in search and rescue activities within areas in the Indian Ocean and its airspace designated for cooperation and support activities and for assistance to affected people, if they spot refugees or are requested to rescue them by U.S. troops and others.|
|Assistance to Affected People|Life-related goods are supplied to UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees) in response to request by the organization.|



**4. SDF Activities**

**(1) Activities by MSDF Units to Help Affected People and Cooperation and Support Activities**
**a. Assistance to Affected People**
The escort vessel Sawagiri and the minesweeping mother ship Uraga, dispatched by MSDF units as part of its
efforts to assist people affected by combat in line with the Anti-Terrorism Special Measures Law, transported
goods and materials necessary for daily life to the port of Karachi, Pakistan. Specifically, the vessels carried
about 200 tons of aid materials[14] such as tents and blankets and delivered them to a local representative office
of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)[15] for two days from December 12, 2001.


-----

**b. Cooperation and Support Activities by the MSDF**
The escort vessel Kurama, the Kirisame, and the supply vessel Hamana were dispatched to the Indian Ocean
for information-gathering operations as part of measures worked out by Japan on September 19, 2001 to
respond to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States. In December 2001, the three vessels
began fueling U.S. naval vessels in the ocean as the MSDF’s cooperation and support activities. The destroyer
Sawagiri and the supply vessel Towada, which had engaged in relief activities for people affected by combat,
joined the three vessels in the Indian Ocean. These MSDF vessels also began fueling British naval ships on
January 29, 2002.
Japan had initially limited the ships to be refueled as its cooperation and support activities to those
belonging to the U.S. and British forces. However, the Government of Japan, judging it necessary to increase
the operational efficiency of the global fight against terrorism, expanded the scope[16] of countries receiving
refueling gradually. As a result, ships from a total of 11 countries became subject to refueling by Japan’s
MSDF as of the end of March this year.
Since the October 2004 revision of the Basic Plan, Japan has provided ships of foreign forces with fuel not
only for the ships but also for ship-based helicopters and water.
Refueling by the MSDF units as part of Japan’s cooperation and support activities since such activities
started reached 700 in November last year, further rising to 744 as of April 12 this year. (See Fig. III-3-1-11)

**(2) Cooperation and Support Activities by ASDF Units**
ASDF units started transport operations between U.S. Forces Japan (USFJ) bases on November 29, 2001, using
C-130H aircraft from the First Transport Wing (Komaki Base), and overseas transport between USFJ bases and
U.S. bases in Guam and other areas on December 3, 2001.
The ASDF units have engaged in transport operations as part of Japan’s cooperation and support activities
for the U.S.-led anti-terrorism operations, mainly using its C-130H transportation aircraft. From 2002, the
ASDF units also began using C-1 transportation aircraft in addition to C-130H transportation aircraft for
transport operations between the U.S. forces bases in Japan. Since 2004, it has been using only C-1 aircraft for
domestic transportation.


-----

Under these transport operations, the ASDF units have airlifted goods and materials of the U.S. forces,
such as aircraft engines, components, maintenance equipment and clothing.
The number of transport operations by the ASDF units since they commenced cooperation and support
activities for the U.S.-led anti-terrorism campaign reached 345 at the end of January this year. (15 times for
overseas transport and 330 times for domestic transport)

**5. Commendation from the World for Japan’s Contribution**
In reference to Japan’s efforts to fight against international terrorism, Afghan President Hamid Kharzai said in
a speech delivered to a U.N. General Assembly session in September 2004 that he wishes to express gratitude
to all countries, particularly the United States, Japan, Germany, Britain and Canada, which have dispatched
their troops and allocated resources, on behalf of the Afghan people. In informal talks with members of Japan’s
House of Representatives special committee on anti-terrorism activities and Iraq, Kharzai also said he thinks
that activities by the MSDF play an indispensable role for the overall anti-terrorism operation by the global
community. He said these activities are significant not only for Afghanistan but also the rest of the international
community.
At an international conference held in London in January last year to help rebuild Afghanistan, Afghan
President Kharzai, British Prime Minister Tony Blair and U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice separately
referred to Japan’s efforts to help reconstruct Afghanistan in their speeches and highly appreciated such
assistance.
When an MSDF vessel paid a port call in France in July 2005 on a practice ocean voyage, the French Navy
provided fuel to the vessel free of charge, expressing France’s gratitude to Japan for supporting the
international anti-terrorism campaign and the country’s contribution to the international community.

Bahrain is an insular Muslim country whose area is about the same as that of Amami Oshima Island. The
Maritime Self-Defense Force Bahrain Liaison Officer is working in the U.S. Navy 5th Fleet Headquarters
located in this country. The liaison officers sent
from 15 countries including Japan are sharing
information and coordinating operations for the
Operation Enduring Freedom-Maritime Interdiction
Operation (OEF-MIO) in the Friendly Forces
Coordination Center (F2C2). In order for vessels of
each country to perform OEF-MIO efficiently to
suppress terrorist activities, continuous fuel supply
from MSDF supply vessels is essential. The U.S.
Navy 5th Fleet Headquarters praises the
cooperation and support activities conducted by the
MSDF that supplies 40% of fuel used by vessels of
other countries than the United States as “extremely Commander Maeda (right) coordinating operations in a Pakistan Navy vessel

important for MIO performed by the fleet of each country to prevent international terrorists from
committing terrorist acts and terrorist supporting activities on the ocean.” I worked as the Liaison Officer
for 14 months from February 2006, and coordinated about 160 cooperation and support activities
(maritime refueling) during the period. I coordinated the activities with the U.S. Navy Logistics Support
Unit, as well as with liaison officers from the United Kingdom, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Germany,
Canada, Pakistan and other countries sending vessels for OEF-MIO. When the liaison officers said
“Thank you” for support of Japan after an NSDF supply vessel and a vessel of their countries meet as
arranged on the large Indian Ocean and maritime refueling was successfully completed, I also felt
recharged to continue with the hard coordination work in the Arabic country where the temperature
exceeds 45°C. My duties also included discussion with other liaison officers to explore a way the MSDF
can perform cooperation and support activities more effectively. Pakistan is the first Muslim country to
participate in OEF-MIO, dispatching vessels and aircrafts on an ongoing basis. Lieutenant-Commander
Imtiaz, the liaison officer from Pakistan Navy, was a good friend of mine working together in F2C2.
Pakistan is sending its six gas turbine vessels built in the United Kingdom to the northern Arabian Sea in
turn to join the terrorism suppression operations. At an F2C2 meeting held immediately prior to my return
to Japan, Lieutenant-Commander Imtiaz expressed his gratitude for the support of the MSDF, and also
read out a message from Rear Admiral Iqbal, who was in command of OEF-MIO between April and
August last year, in the presence of the other liaison officers. The message was as follows: “We greatly
appreciate the commitment of Japan in the supply of fuel for vessels and aircrafts as well as drink water
for maintaining lives of the crew to the Pakistan Navy. The Pakistan Navy vessels require high-quality
fuel to drive their gas turbine engines, and depends almost 100% on the MSDF supply vessels. It is no
exaggeration to say that it is the continuous support of Japan that enables Pakistan to take part in OEFMIO as a nation.” The Bahrain Liaison Officer is a background staff member making invisible efforts
under the harsh environment to ensure that the MSDF performs cooperation and support activities without
fail. However, when I was thanked by other liaison officers for the smooth support activities of our
country, and I forwarded the message to the crew working very hard on the vessels, I felt very rewarded.

**4. Efforts to Support U.N. peacekeeping operations (PKO)**
As a way to prevent the recurrence of regional conflicts after a cease-fire agreement, the United Nations
sponsors peacekeeping operations, such as cease-fire monitoring, election monitoring, and reconstruction
assistance. As of the end of April this year, U.N. peacekeeping operations are underway in 15 places around the
world, mainly in Africa and the Middle East. (See
Reference 4)
In addition, international organizations, such as the
UNHCR, and individual countries engage in relief and
reconstruction activities for the victims of conflicts
and large-scale disasters from a humanitarian
perspective or from the viewpoint of stabilizing the
domestic situations of affected countries.
Japan, in a bid to fulfill a role commensurate to its
international status, has been cooperating, both on
human and financial fronts, with global efforts being
led by the United Nations to build a peaceful and

-----

In order to help improve the international security environment, the Defense Ministry and the SDF have
positively engaged in international peace cooperation activities by dispatching troops, among other ways.

**1. Outline of International Peace Cooperation Law**
The International Peace Cooperation Law, enacted in June 1992, is designed to contribute further to global
efforts being led by the United Nations to achieve peace in the international community by upgrading Japan’s
framework for cooperating appropriately and speedily in 1) U.N. peacekeeping activities[17], 2) humanitarian
support for international relief and rescue operations[18] and 3) international election-monitoring activities.
The law stipulates a set of basic guidelines (the so-called five principles for participation) for Japan’s
participation in a U.N. peacekeeping force (PKF).
Japan had suspended the SDF’s participation in PKF’s so-called core operations[19]. Meanwhile, Japan had
provided logistical support to PKF missions, and steadily accumulated achievements and experience in the
area. Finding expectations both at home and home for further participation in international peace cooperation
activities, Japan amended the International Peace Cooperation Law in December 2001. The amendment lifted
the ban on the SDF’s participation in core PKF operations. (See Figs. III-3-1-12 • 13)

**Fig. III-3-1-12 Basic Policy on Japan’s Participation in U.N. Peacekeeping Forces (Five Principles)**

1 Warring parties must reach a cease-fire accord.
2 Warring parties, including those from the countries in which the U.N. peacekeeping force are to operate, must
consent to the U.N. force’s operations and Japan’s participation in the operations of the U.N. force.
3 The U.N. peacekeeping force must take a neutral stance; they should not side with any particular warring parties.
4 Japan must ensure that the SDF can withdraw from operations of the U.N. peacekeeping force if either one of the
three principles stated above is not met.
5 The use of weapons by SDF members participating in operations of the U.N. peacekeeping force should be limited as
much as possible to situations that are conceivably necessary to protect the members’ lives.

**2. United Nations Political Mission in Nepal (UNMIN)**

**(1) Background behind establishment of UNMIN**
In Nepal, the Maoists (Communist Party of Nepal) started armed struggle against the King in 1996 in a bid to
capture power from him, leaving the country in a state of civil war for about 10 years. In May last year, a new
government was inaugurated in Nepal. As a result of series of peace negotiations between the Maoists and the
Government, both parties reached in June last year an eight-point agreement, including requesting the United
Nations to oversee the management of weapons possessed by the Nepalese military and the Maoists, and
soldiers of both sides. In November 2006, the Government and the Maoists signed an agreed document for
realizing permanent peace in Nepal, which includes the holding of Constituent Assembly elections by the
middle of June this year, and which spells out a framework for the United Nations to monitor the management
of weapons of both sides and their soldiers. Later, both parties signed Comprehensive Peace Agreement, which
includes transforming the existing cease-fire into a permanent and sustainable peace.
On January 24 (January 23 in New York time) this year, the U.N. Security Council unanimously adopted
UNSC Resolution 1740, which decided the establishment of a United Nations Political Mission in Nepal
(UNMIN), whose primary tasks are shown below, acting on a request by the Nepalese Government. The
establishment of UNMIN will last until January 22 next year.
❍ Monitoring the management of arms and armed personnel of both sides in line with the provisions of the
Comprehensive Peace Agreement

❍ Assisting the parties through a Joint Monitoring Coordinating Committee (JMCC) in implementing their
agreement on the management of arms and armed personnel of both sides

❍ Assisting in the monitoring of cease-fire arrangements
❍ Providing technical support for the planning, preparation and conduct of the election of a Constituent
Assembly

❍ Providing a small team of electoral monitors to study all technical aspects of the electoral process, and report
on the conduct of the election

**(2) Background behind Japan’s Personnel Dispatch to UNMIN**
Bordered by China and India, Nepal is located in a point of strategic importance, making the country’s stability
very important for the stability of its surrounding region. In light of the possibility that a so-called “bankrupt
state” will become a hotbed of terrorists and will make impacts on the international situation, it is important for
Japan, as a member of the Asian region, to make contribution not only on financial but also on personnel terms
at a time when the international community is making lofty efforts to restore peace and stability in Nepal.
On March 27 this year, Japan’s Cabinet, acting on a
request by the United Nations for the dispatch of
military-monitoring personnel to UNMIN operations,
decided to dispatch personnel to the mission. Following
the decision, six GSDF officers have been posted at
UNMIN since March 30. (See Fig. III-3-1-14)

The six GSDF officers being dispatched to UNMIN do not carry weapons in line with provisions of the
United Nations. The officers, dispatched on an individual basis, have been working as military-monitoring
personnel, which is different from the past personnel dispatch by Japan for the support of U.N. peacekeeping
operations where SDF officers were dispatched both as military-monitoring personnel and personnel posted for
the assignment at peacekeeping headquarters.

**3. International Peace Cooperation Activities in the Golan Heights**

**(1) Background to Japan’s Decision to Send Troops to UNDOF**
The United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) has been undertaking peacekeeping operations
in a zone called the Area of Separation (AOS), set up between the opposing troops of Syria and Israel that have
agreed to a cease-fire. UNDOF’s mission is to observe a cease-fire between the two countries and the
implementation of measures stipulated under an agreement between the countries over the separation of their
opposing troops.
Japan’s SDF has been providing logistical support for UNDOF operations. (See Figs. III-3-1-15 • 16)
Japan’s participation in the UNDOF operations is significant because it marks Japan’s personnel
contribution to world efforts to achieve peace in the Middle East. The participation is also significant for Japan
because it would help develop human resources so that he or she can fulfill duties for international peace
cooperation activities.
The Government of Japan decided in December 1995 to dispatch SDF units and others to the UNDOF. In
February 1996, the first transport unit of 43 personnel was sent to the Golan Heights, and replaced a Canadian
transport unit. Since then, an SDF unit has been sent there every six months on a rotating basis. As of the end
of May this year, the 23rd dispatch of the transport unit was operating in the Golan Heights.

**(2) Activities of SDF**
The dispatched SDF transport unit is in charge of transporting daily goods and materials needed for UNDOF
operations from the harbors, airports and commodities markets of Israel, Syria and Lebanon to the UNDOF
campsites. The unit also provides logistical support, including repairs of roads which have become slippery due
to rain and snowfall, and removal of snow from streets in plateau areas with an altitude of more than 2,800
meters. The transport unit is stationed in the same campsite as Indian forces, which replaced Canadian forces in
March last year. Members of the SDF and Indian forces share their meals and others.
The ASDF flies a C-130H transport plane and a U-4 multipurpose assistance plane to the Golan Heights
every six months to transport goods and materials for the transport unit.
Two SDF officers being sent to the UNDOF headquarters overseas take charge of planning and
coordination of transport and other UNDOF rear-support operations, and are also responsible for publicity and
budget-related works. SDF officers are assigned to the UNDOF headquarters for about one year, and are
replaced by other SDF personnel after completing their assignment. SDF personnel working at the UNDOF
headquarters as of the end of May this year are the 12th to be sent there.
Japan had originally intended to complete its participation in UNDOF operations within two years.
However, participation has continued until now after taking into consideration various factors, such as strong
requests from the United Nations, commendation being given to past Japanese operations by the United
Nations and relevant countries, and the importance of Japan’s personnel contribution to peace in the Middle
East. Japan’s contribution to UNDOF has been deepened with the SDF dispatch to the mission totaling 23 units
with a total of about 1,000 personnel.
The experience the SDF has accumulated through the mission has been helpful in paving the groundwork
for participation in other U.N. peacekeeping operations and activities to support the reconstruction of Iraq.

only Arabic. I am trying very hard to communicate with them using gestures everyday, but these efforts
sometimes fail, making us unable to receive fuels and other supplies at designated time. I am also
sometimes annoyed by some local suppliers who try to cheat us on the quantity of fuel by saying “shwai
shwai” (slowly) with the finger tips of each hand put together above the palm—a typical gesture of local
people. Despite these difficulties, however, I am fulfilling my duties thanks to the support from my
colleagues in the unit.
Through this mission, I have realized that we can communicate our feelings to each other even when
we do not understand language and gestures. We are working here to maintain peace in Syria and Israel,
which will ultimately lead to peace in the world and Japan. I am sure that our desire for peace is
understood by local people.
Although working here is not easy, I am leading a very exciting life every day by actively playing my
part on the global stage. I will continue to do my best for the peace of Japan and the international society
in the future as well.

**4. Dispatch of Self-Defense Officials to the U.N. Department of Peacekeeping Operations**
In 2000, the United Nations established the Panel[20] on U.N. Peace Operations to review all issues associated
with peace operations including U.N. peacekeeping operations. The United Nations expanded the number of
officials in the Department of Peacekeeping Operations (PKO Department) in line with recommendations by
the panel, as a means of reinforcing the peacekeeping function of the U.N. headquarters.
In November 2001, the Law on Working Conditions of Defense Agency Officials Dispatched to
International Organizations (then) (1995 Law No. 122; hereinafter referred to as the “Dispatched Defense
Agency Officials Working Conditions Law”) was revised to enable the Defense Agency (then) to send its
officials to the PKO Department. The revision was based on the judgment that the agency’s dispatch of
officials to the U.N. department would contribute to supporting the United Nations in its efforts toward
achieving world peace. Under the revised law, one GSDF officer was dispatched in December 2002 to the
Military Planning Section of the Military Division in the PKO Department of the United Nations, which is
located in the United States. The dispatched GSDF official has been participating in various works including
policy planning and formulation of measures for the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti
(MINUSTAH), set up in June 2004.

**5. International Disaster Relief Operations**
The Defense Ministry and the SDF are determined to step up international disaster-relief operations from the
viewpoint of increasing humanitarian contributions and improving the international security environment. The
Defense Ministry has kept the GSDF, the MSDF and the ASDF ready to take any necessary action based on
prepared disaster-relief operation plans, whenever a situation in which their operations are deemed necessary
arises. The SDF has dispatched its units overseas for international disaster-relief operations while closely
examining specific relief requests filed by governments of affected countries and disaster situations in these
countries. Each of the SDF’s three units—the GSDF, the MSDF and the ASDF—has been conducting
international disaster-relief operations in a manner that would increase the function and ability of each unit.
(See Fig. III-3-1-17) (See Reference 50)

**1. Outline of the Law Concerning the Dispatch of International Disaster-Relief Teams**
Since the Law Concerning the Dispatch of International Disaster-Relief Teams (1987 Law No. 93; hereinafter
referred to as “the International Disaster-Relief Law”) was enacted in 1987, Japan has engaged in international

disaster-relief activities in response to requests from the governments of affected countries and international
organizations.
In 1992, the International Disaster-Relief Law was amended to enable the SDF to participate in
international disaster-relief operations and to transport its personnel and equipment. Since then, the SDF has
maintained its readiness for international disaster-relief operations with self-sufficient capabilities, including
relief operations and medical treatment, and with the use of its own equipment, organizations and benefits of
regular training, even when local support is not available for transport, accommodation, food and water
supplies, communications, sanitation, and so forth.

**2. International Disaster-Relief Operations by the SDF and the SDF’s Posture**
International disaster-relief operations conducted by the SDF may take different forms according to factors
such as the scale of the disaster, the degree of damage, and the requests of the governments of affected
countries or international organizations. The SDF’s past record on domestic disaster-relief operations indicates
possible fields of cooperation to be extended by the SDF overseas for disaster relief.
These fields are:
1) medical service, such as first-aid medical treatment and epidemic prevention;
2) transport of goods, patients, and disaster-relief personnel by helicopter;
3) ensuring water supplies using water-purifying devices;
Also, the SDF may use transport planes and transport ships to carry disaster-relief personnel, and
equipment to the affected area.
Regional units of the GSDF are assigned duties on a six-month rotational basis to ensure that they can
provide medical, transport and water-supply services in a self-sufficient manner anytime the need for disasterrelief operations arises.


-----

The MSDF and the ASDF are always prepared to have their fleet and air-support teams, respectively,
transport supplies to their units or units participating in international disaster-relief operations anytime the need
for disaster relief arises.

**3. International Disaster-Relief Activities by Japan after Earthquake in Central Java Island**
On May 27 last year, a large-scale earthquake hit central Java Island in Indonesia, destroying almost all of the
buildings in southern part of the Yogyakarta Special Region, located near the focus of the quake, and leaving
many people killed and injured.
On May 29, the Japanese Foreign Minister, acting on a request by the Government of Indonesia for Japan’s
cooperation, discussed its response to the quake with the Director-General of Defense Agency (then) based on
the International Disaster-Relief Law. The discussion led the Government of Japan to dispatch SDF personnel
to areas affected by the earthquake to have them undertake international disaster-relief operations. The SDF
personnel being dispatched to the affected areas provided medical services to quake victims in view of the
scarcity of medical doctors in the areas, especially in mountainous areas, treating a total of about 3,800 local
people and vaccinating about 1,700 people as well as taking epidemic-prevention measures in a 4,300-squaremeter area.

Section 2. Promotion of Security Dialogue and Defense Exchanges

The new National Defense Program Guidelines (NDPG) says making independent and proactive efforts to help
improve an international security environment should be regarded as a major role to be played by defense
capability. Based on the idea, the Ministry of Defense and the SDF have been promoting security dialogue and
defense exchanges, including bilateral and multilateral training, in addition to participation in international
peace cooperation activities.
This section will describe efforts being made by the Ministry of Defense and the SDF to promote security
dialogue and defense exchanges.

**1. Significance of Security Dialogue and Defense Exchanges**
After the end of the Cold War, it has become important for countries to curb meaningless arms races and
prevent accidental military clashes and their escalation by increasing the transparency of their military
capabilities and defense policies, and promoting dialogue and exchanges between defense officials from
different countries, and bilateral defense exercises for mutual confidence-building. This idea is now widely
shared in the international society.
In areas surrounding Japan, large-scale military forces, including nuclear arms, continue to exist, and a
large number of countries have devoted themselves to modernizing their military capabilities. In addition,
unclear and uncertain factors have remained over issues related to the Korean Peninsula and the Strait of
Taiwan.
Imperative issues to be tackled together by the international community are how to respond to new threats
and diverse contingencies, including the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the spread of ballistic
missiles. Against this background, it is widely recognized that the international community should join hands
in addressing these issues.
Under these security circumstances, the Government of Japan, in order to solidify peace and stability of the
international community and the region, recognizes that it is necessary for countries in the world to build
relations of mutual confidence and promote defense cooperation both on bilateral and multilateral bases. The
Ministry of Defense and the SDF thus place an importance on bilateral exchanges as well as, multilateral
security dialogue such as the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) and joint multilateral defense exercises. The
Ministry of Defense and the SDF will redouble their efforts to improve the security environment by deepening
and widening these defense relations taking into account the movements of countries concerned.
In recent years, Japan’s defense exchanges, in line with changes in the international situations and others,
have come to place an emphasis on 1) confidence-building, and the significance of establishing and
strengthening cooperative relations with the global community 2) more global exchanges that go beyond
Japan’s neighboring countries and 3) the importance of promoting not only goodwill exchanges but also
practical exchanges, and stepping up not only dialogue-based exchanges but also action-based exchanges.
At a time when Japan’s defense exchanges have been expanding both qualitatively and quantitatively, the
Defense Ministry formulated a basic policy[21] for defense exchanges in April this year as a way for all officials
at the ministry to get united in implementing such exchanges strategically.
The basic policy features emphasizing exchanges[22] aimed at contributing directly to enhanced international
defense cooperation in addition to promoting conventional defense exchanges. The basic policy also calls for
Japan to build relations of trust and cooperation with other countries by effectively utilizing a variety of
defense-exchange means[23] not limited to bilateral dialogue and consultations.
The Ministry of Defense, based on the basic policy, will formulate region and country plans for defense
exchanges, expand defense-exchange plans and their implementation, and devise a mid-term defense-exchange


-----

program so that ideas and directions envisaged under the basic policy can become concrete and get realized.
(See Fig. III-3-2-1)

**2. Bilateral Defense Relations**
Bilateral defense exchanges, involving officials of two countries in charge of defense affairs, are intended to
promote building of reliable and cooperative relations between them. The characteristics of bilateral defense
relations lies in the fact that they can be tailored to meet special needs in bilateral relations and that bilateral
relations of trust and cooperation established through such exchanges can become a basis on which to
effectively promote multilateral security dialogue and others.

**1. Japan-Republic of Korea Defense Exchanges**
The Republic of Korea (ROK) is an important country for Japan’s security given its geopolitical location. It is
also a friendly country for Japan as both countries respect fundamental values such as freedom and democracy.
The ROK has formed an alliance with the United States and let it station its forces in the country from the
viewpoint of maintaining security, as Japan has done. Therefore, it is extremely important for Japan and the


-----

ROK to promote mutual understanding and relations of trust, and establish a basis for cooperation and to
coordinate and cooperate further effectively in policy-making for the peace and stability of the entire East
Asian region.
In their summit meeting in 1998, then Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi and then ROK President Kim
Dae Jung pledged to work toward building a new partnership between the two countries, and announced a Joint
Statement, entitled “A New Japan-ROK Partnership Toward the 21st Century.” The two leaders welcomed
bilateral security dialogue and defense exchanges, and agreed to further promote them.

**(1) Exchanges of High-Level Defense Officials Including Top Officials**
Almost every year since 1994 (except for 2001, 2004 and 2006), the defense ministers of Japan and the ROK
have met alternately in each other’s country.
In February this year, ROK Minister of National Defense Kim Jang-Soo visited Japan and exchanged
views with his Japanese counterpart Fumio Kyuma over the situation of Northeastern Asia and defense policies
of their countries. Kyuma and Kim agreed to set up a new emergency communication system between the
director of the Operations Department of Japan’s Joint Staff Office and the ROK Joint Chiefs of Staff and also
agreed to start defense exchanges between defense facility-related sections of the two countries.
In March this year, Chief of Staff Takashi Saito of Japan’s Joint Staff Office visited ROK and held frank
discussions with Kim Kwan Jin, Chairman of the ROK Joint Chiefs of Staff.

**(2) Regular Consultations between Defense Officials**
In addition to holding military-to-military consultations (bilateral consultations at the Director-General
level/the Councilor level) every year since 1994, Japan and the ROK have held bilateral security dialogue with
participants that include diplomatic and defense authorities of the two countries since 1998.
In December last year, Japan and the ROK held the 14th military-to-military consultations, and defense
officials from the two countries exchanged views over the East Asian situation, defense policies of the two
countries, efforts by the two countries on international peace cooperation activities and Japan-ROK defense
exchanges. In May this year, Japan and the ROK had the sixth bilateral security dialogue and exchanged views
on the security situation surrounding the two countries and their security policies.
Dialogue has also been held between Japan’s Joint Staff Office and the ROK Joint Chiefs of Staff and
between Japan’s GSDF, MSDF and the ASDF, and the ROK Army, Navy and the Air Force respectively. In
addition, Japan and the ROK have been promoting mutual exchanges of students and bilateral interchanges on
defense research.

**(3) Exchanges between Units**
Japan’s GSDF and the ROK’s Army have promoted defense exchanges since 2001, including mutual visits by
unit commanders between the GSDF’s Western Army and the ROK’s Second Army.
Exchanges between Japan’s MSDF and the ROK Navy, including mutual visits by naval vessels, have been
carried out since 1994. In September last year, a vessel of the ROK Navy visited Japan on a training mission.
The Japanese MSDF and the ROK Navy conducted their joint search and rescue exercise in June this year, the
fifth of its kind between the two countries.
Japan’s ASDF and the ROK Air Force have continued exchanges through mutual visits by aircraft since
2000. The ASDF Central Band participated in an international military band festival held in ROK in October
last year. The ASDF’s transport aircraft flew to ROK, marking their third visit to ROK, to transport some
members of the ASDF Central Band and their musical instruments as well as making a goodwill visit to ROK.


-----

**2. Japan-Russia Defense Exchanges**
Russia, also being a neighboring country of Japan, has a great influence on the security of Europe, Central Asia
and the Asia-Pacific region, making it extremely important for Japan to deepen defense exchanges with this
country and promote relations of trust and cooperation.
With Japan-Russia relations continuing to develop in wider areas following the 1997 summit between their
leaders in Krasnoyarsk, Japan’s Ministry of Defense has been steadily promoting defense relations with Russia.
In 1999, Japan and Russia signed a memorandum to confirm the direction of their defense exchanges. In
January 2003, then Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi made an official visit to Russia and signed the
Japan-Russia Action Plan[24] with Russian President Vladimir Putin. In this Action Plan, the leaders of Japan and
Russia confirmed that the two countries would steadily promote their defense relations by continuing programs
such as high-level dialogue, consultations between defense officials of both countries, bilateral exercises and
goodwill exercises. Moreover, when Russian President Putin visited Japan in November 2005 and held talks
with then Japanese Prime Minister Koizumi, the two leaders confirmed that relations between Japan and Russia
have advanced steadily in wider fields in line with the Japan-Russia Action Plan.

**(1) Exchanges of High-Level Defense Officials Including Top Officials**
In 1996, then Minister of State for Defense Hideo Usui visited Russia, becoming the first Japanese defense
chief to visit the country since the Soviet era.
When then Japanese Minister of State for Defense Fukushiro Nukaga visited Russia in January of last year,
Japan and Russia renewed the 1999 memorandum on defense exchanges between the two countries. Then
Russian Defense Minister Sergey Ivanov told his counterpart Nukaga that the Japan-Russia Action Plan has
helped pave the foundation for the two countries to deepen cooperation between their high-level defense
officials. Minister Ivanov also said defense exchanges have deepened most between MSDF and Russia’s Navy
but added he wanted to promote exchanges between GSDF and the ASDF, and Russia’s Army and the Air
Force. Minister Nukaga and Minister Ivanov also
agreed that GSDF and Russia’s ground troops will
mutually visit each other’s country to attend defense
exercises as observers. They also agreed that
representatives and aircraft of the ASDF and Russia’s
Air Force will be sent to each other’s country.
In May last year, then GSDF Chief of Staff Mori
visited Russia and held frank talks with Aleksei
Maslov, Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Ground
Forces. In October last year, Yuri Baluyevsky, Chief
of the Russian Armed Forces General Staff, visited
Japan and exchanged views with Saito, Chief of Staff Saito, Chief of Staff of the Joint Staff Office, meets Baluyevsky, Chief of the
of the Joint Staff Office. Russian Armed Forces General Staff

**(2) Regular Consultations between Defense Officials**
The Ministry of Defense has continued to hold consultations with Russia, such as Japan-Russia Bilateral
Working Group meetings, to discuss how to promote their defense relations in addition to holding regular
consultations between Director-General level/Councilor-level defense officials of the two countries. It has also
continued to hold an annual conference to review the implementation of the Japan-Russia Agreement on the
Prevention of Incidents on and over the High Seas.


-----

Besides, the GSDF and ASDF have actively held dialogue with their respective Russian counterparts, the
Russian Ground and Air Forces, including Staff Talks between Japan’s Joint Staff Office and the General Staff
Office of the Russian Armed Forces. In addition, the National Institute for Defense Studies has continued to
conduct joint studies with a research institute[25] affiliated with the Russian Defense Ministry.

**(3) Exchanges between Units**
The GSDF and the Russian Ground Forces have promoted their mutual exchanges since 2003, including a
mutual visit to each other’s country between the Russian Commander of Far Eastern Military District and the
Commanding General of the GSDF’s Northern Army. In October last year, the Commanding General of the
GSDF’s Northern Army visited the Far Eastern Military District of Russia.
The MSDF and the Russian Navy have conducted mutual visits by vessels every year since the MSDF’s
first port visit on Vladivostok in 1996. Both parties have conducted bilateral exercises for search and rescue
operations since 1998. In October last year, the MSDF and the Russian Navy conducted their eighth joint
exercise for search and rescue operations when a warship of the Russian Pacific Fleet visited Japan.

**3. Japan-China Defense Exchanges**
China has great influence on the Asia-Pacific region and its outstanding economic development and the
modernization of its military capabilities in recent years have drawn much attention from other countries in the
world. Japan’s deepening mutual understanding with China on the defense front and promoting relations of
trust between them will be meaningful not only for increasing the security of the two countries but also for
ensuring peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region.
In his visit to China in 1998, then Japanese Minister of State for Defense Fumio Kyuma and his Chinese
counterpart reached an agreement on the ways to promote defense relations between Japan and China,
including continued dialogue between their chiefs of defense.
In their summit meeting in 1998, then Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi and then Chinese President
Jiang Zemin released the Japan-China Joint Declaration on Building a Partnership of Friendship and
Cooperation for Peace and Development. The two leaders confirmed that defense relations between Japan and
China had played an important role in increasing mutual understanding, and agreed to promote defense and
security exchanges in a gradual manner.
Furthermore, when Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe made an official visit to Japan in October last
year, Japan and China released a Joint Press Statement in which the two countries agreed to deepen mutual
trust on the security front through bilateral security dialogue and defense exchanges. In meetings of Japanese
and Chinese leaders held in January and April this year, the two countries agreed to upgrade a system of
communication between defense authorities of both countries. In the April summit, the Chinese side expressed
intention to have National Defense Minister Cao Gangchuan visit Japan in autumn this year.
The Defense Ministry, through meeting with Chinese defense authorities, strove to deepen their
understanding of Japan’s defense policy while asking Beijing to increase the transparency of its defense
capability and defense policy.

**(1) Exchanges of High-Level Defense Officials Including Top Officials**
In September 2003, then Minister of State for Defense Shigeru Ishiba visited China and met with Chinese
Minister of National Defense Cao Gangchuan. At their meeting, Minister Ishiba and Minister Cao agreed that
Japan and China would promote defense exchanges, including those between high-level defense officials.
In November last year, Zhang Qinsheng, then Assistant Chief of General Staff of the Chinese People’s
Liberation Army, visited Japan and held talks with Japanese Administrative Vice Minister for Defense


-----

Takemasa Moriya over the regional situation, defense
policies of Japan and China, and bilateral defense
exchanges. Moriya and Zhang agreed on the
importance for the two countries to further promote
exchanges between defense officials of their countries.

**(2) Regular Consultations between Defense**
**Officials**

In July of last year, Japan and China held security
dialogue between their diplomatic and defense
officials. The two countries also have promoted
research and educational exchanges, which mainly Zhang Qinsheng, Assistant Chief of General Staff of the General Staff

Headquarters of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (then), meets Japanese

involve acceptance of Chinese defense officials for the Administrative Vice Minister for Defense Moriya
enrolment in a regular course of Japan’s National Institute for Defense Studies. The two countries also have
continued mutual visits between defense officials taking regular courses at Japan’s National Institute for
Defense Studies, the Joint Staff College and China’s National Defense University.

**(3) Exchange between Units**
When Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao visited Japan in April of this year, he and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo
Abe agreed that the two countries will make efforts to realize mutual port visits by warships at an early date.

**4. Defense Exchanges with Australia**
Australia, sharing with Japan fundamental values such as respect for freedom, human rights, and democracy, is
an important partner for Japan in the Asia-Pacific region. On the security issue, both countries, being allies of
the United States, share the same strategic interest, and there are many issues of mutual concern in the area of
defense. In this context, it is important for Japan to promote defense relations with Australia, establish a basis
for cooperative relationship, and step up cooperation and coordination more effectively, in order to secure
peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region.
In recent years, defense exchanges between Japan and Australia have been deepened and expanded with
bilateral collaboration[26] on the security field advancing steadily, including cooperation in Iraqi reconstruction
activities and humanitarian support in the event of disasters.
Based on these circumstances, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his Australian counterpart John
Howard released the Japan-Australia Joint Declaration on Security Cooperation[27] on March 13 of this year in
order for the two countries to further strengthen bilateral security cooperation under a comprehensive
framework.
The Japan-Australia Joint Declaration on Security Cooperation is intended to devise a framework for the
two countries to further strengthen and expand their bilateral cooperation on the security front.
The scope of security cooperation between Japan and Australia will include at least nine items shown
below:
1) law enforcement on combating transnational crime, including trafficking in illegal narcotics and precursors,
people smuggling and trafficking, counterfeiting currency and arms smuggling;
2) border security;
3) counter-terrorism;
4) disarmament and counter-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery;
5) peace operations;


-----

6) exchange of strategic assessments and related information;
7) maritime and aviation security;
8) humanitarian relief operations, including disaster relief;
9) contingency planning, including for pandemics.
As part of the above-mentioned cooperation, Japan and Australia will, as appropriate, strengthen practical
cooperation, including through:
1) exchange of personnel;
2) joint exercises and training to further increase effectiveness of cooperation, including in the area of
humanitarian relief operations;
3) coordinated activities including those in the areas of law enforcement, peace operations, and regional
capacity building.
The two countries agreed on four items shown below for implementation in the future.

❍ Japan and Australia will develop an action plan with specific measures to advance security cooperation in
the above areas.

❍ Japan and Australia will build on their dialogue between Defense Ministers, on an annual basis.
❍ Japan and Australia will further strengthen the strategic dialogue between their Foreign Ministers on an
annual basis.

❍ Japan and Australia will enhance joint Defense and Foreign Ministry dialogue, including through the
establishment of a regular Ministerial dialogue.
Based on this joint declaration, Japanese Minister
of Defense Fumio Kyuma and his Australian
counterpart Brendan Nelson held talks in Tokyo in
June this year. During Nelson’s stay in Tokyo, Japan
and Australia also held Joint Defense and Foreign
Ministerial Consultations (“two-plus-two”) for the first
time. During the Kyuma-Nelson meeting, Japan and
Australia highly evaluated the advancement of defense
exchanges between the two countries and their
cooperation in the field of international peace
cooperation activities that has been enhanced between

Japan-Australia Foreign and Defense Ministerial Consultations (“2-Plus-2”) them since Japan’s participation in peacekeeping

operations in Cambodia. The defense chiefs of the two countries also agreed to expand bilateral defense
exchanges by promoting exchanges between their defense units through mutual visits of aircraft and ships and
boosting personnel exchanges. The defense chiefs also agreed to cooperate in contributing to trilateral
collaboration between Japan, the United States and Australia and multilateral collaboration by promoting
bilateral cooperation between Japan and Australia. Kyuma and Nelson also decided to begin work to update a
memorandum on defense exchanges which the defense chiefs of the two countries agreed during their meeting
in 2003, as the Joint Declaration on Security Cooperation action plan in the field of defense. During their “twoplus-two” security talks, the Defense and Foreign Ministers of the two countries highly evaluated and
welcomed these agreements between Kyuma and Nelson, and issued a Joint Statement[28] that evaluated and
welcomed the accords.
Based on the Kyuma-Nelson meeting and the “two-plus-two” security talks, Japan and Australia have been
currently holding consultations in order to expand their defense cooperation.


-----

**(1) Exchanges of High-Level Defense Officials Including Top Officials**
Japan and Australia have continuously promoted exchanges between high-level defense officials, including the
defense chiefs of their countries. Then Australian Defense Minister Robert Hill visited Japan in September
2003 and met with then Japanese Minister of State for Defense Shigeru Ishiba. During their meeting, Hill and
Ishiba signed a memorandum on defense exchanges between Japan and Australia.
In March this year, Defense Minister Fumio Kyuma met with Australian Prime Minister John Howard
during the latter’s visit to Japan. Kyuma and Howard then confirmed the need for the two counties to advance
bilateral defense exchanges in the future. When Japanese Defense Minister Kyuma attended the sixth Asia
Security Conference sponsored by the International Institute for Strategic Study (IISS) in June this year, he
held talks with U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates and Australian Defense Minister Brendan Nelson,
marking the first trilateral meeting of defense chiefs
between Japan, the United States and Australia. The
defense chiefs of Japan, the United States and
Australia agreed to promote security and defense
cooperation among the three countries.
In September last year, Geoff Shepherd, Chief of
the Royal Australian Air Force, visited Japan and held
talks with then ASDF Chief of Staff Tadashi Yoshida
while in March this year, Peter Leahy, Chief of the
Australian Army, visited Japan and met with then
GSDF Chief of Staff Tsutomu Mori. In February this
year, MSDF Chief of Staff Eiji Yoshikawa visited
Australia and held discussion with Russ Shalders, MSDF Chief of Staff Yoshikawa meets Sir Band, U.K. First Sea Lord
Chief of the Royal Australian Navy.

**(2) Regular Consultations between Defense Officials**
Japan and Australia have held military-to-military talks at the Director-General level/Councilor level as well as
security dialogue which include diplomatic officials every year since 1996. The Joint Staff Office, the GSDF,
the MSDF and the ASDF have also held consultations with their respective counterparts in the Australian
military on a regular basis. Both countries have accepted each other’s defense officials in their defense-related
educational institutions and promoted research exchanges.
Especially in recent years, the two countries frequently held talks on various topics, reflecting the
advancement of bilateral cooperative relations. Last year, the two countries held consultations of defense
officials for two times. They held similar consultations in May this year. In April this year, Japan, the United
States and Australia held Director-General-level talks for the first time and discussed defense cooperation
among the three countries and other issues.

**(3) Exchanges between Units**
Japan and Australia have promoted defense exchanges, including mutual goodwill visits by vessels and aircraft
between the MSDF and the Royal Australian Navy. Most recently, the MSDF’s P-3C patrol airplanes made a
goodwill visit to Australia for the first time and conducted an exercise in May and June last year.
In addition, Japan and Australia have promoted their defense exchanges in the field of international peace
cooperation. The GSDF units dispatched to East Timor and Iraq, for example, had exchanges with units of the
Australian Army sent there.

**5. Defense Exchanges with U.K.**

Sir Torpy, Chief of the Air Staff of U.K. Royal Air Force, meets ASDF Chief of Staff
Tamogami


Being a major power having influence not only on the
European area but also on the world, the U.K. has
maintained close relations with Japan. On the security
front, Japan has shared the same strategic interest with
the U.K. because both countries are important allies of
the United States. Given this relations, it is important
for both Japan and the U.K. to promote defense
exchanges, build a basis of cooperation and promote
cooperation and coordination.
In January 2004, then Japanese Minister of State
for Defense Shigeru Ishiba and then U.K. Secretary of
State for Defense Geoff Hoon signed a memorandum
on bilateral defense exchanges, which confirmed the
two countries’ resolve to promote defense exchanges
at all levels and in various fields.


**(1) Exchanges of High-Level Defense Officials Including Top Officials**
In January last year, then Japanese Minister of State for Defense Fukushiro Nukaga visited the U.K. and met
with then U.K. Secretary of State for Defense John Reid. During their meeting, Minister Nukaga and Secretary
Reid confirmed that high-level and working-level defense exchanges have advanced between Japan and the
U.K. They also discussed the progress of Iraqi Security Forces’ training and the process of transferring security
authorities to Iraq.
When Nukaga attended the fifth IISS Asia Security Conference in June last year, he met with Adam
Ingram, U.K. Minister of State for the Armed Forces. During their meeting, Nukaga expressed gratitude to
Ingram for cooperation being extended by U.K. armed forces to Japan’s SDF troops operating in Iraq. Nukaga
and Ingram also exchanged views over issues including the transfer of security authorities to Iraq.

**(2) Regular Consultations between Defense Officials**
Japan and the U.K. frequently hold exchanges of their defense officials. Among such exchanges are DirectorGeneral level and councilor-level defense talks and security talks that also include diplomatic officials,
including exchanges of views over defense policies of the two countries and Iraqi issues. Japan’s Joint Staff
Office, the GSDF, the MSDF and the ASDF have also held consultations with their respective U.K.
counterparts on a regular basis. Both countries have accepted each other’s defense officials in their defenserelated educational institutions and promoted research exchanges.

**(3) Exchanges between Units**
The GSDF[29] deployed its troops in Muthanna Province in Iraq in January 2004 following the deployment there
of the U.K. forces.
The GSDF troops promoted exchanges with those of the U.K. forces in Samawah in the province.

**6. Japan-India Defense Exchanges**
Traditionally, India has maintained friendly relations with Japan, with both respecting such fundamental values
as democracy and market-oriented economy.


-----

India, with its vast land and its population exceeding 1 billion, has had great influence on the security of the
South Asian region. South Asia is an important region for the safety of sea-lane linking Japan and the Middle
East, and is also important for operations being conducted by SDF in the Indian Ocean.
Given these relations, it is meaningful for Japan and India to hold consultations to exchange views over
defense policies of the two countries and the regional situation, and deepen their mutual understanding as well
as to promote relations of mutual trust and cooperation.
In December last year, Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh visited Japan and signed a joint statement
between Japan and India after meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. In the joint statement, the
two countries agreed to upgrade Japan-India relations to “Strategic and Global Partnership[30]” and specified
measures to be taken in political and security fields toward building such partnership.

**(1) Exchanges of High-Level Defense Officials Including Top Officials**
In May last year, then Indian Defense Minister Pranab Mukherjee visited Japan and held talks with then
Japanese Minister of State for Defense Fukushiro
Nukaga over defense policies of the two countries and
the international situation. After the meeting, the
defense chiefs of the two countries signed a joint
statement concerning bilateral cooperation in the field
of defense. Last year, then MSDF Chief of Staff
Takashi Saito, then GSDF Chief of Staff Tsutomu
Mori and then ASDF Chief of Staff Tadashi Yoshida
separately visited India, holding frank talks with their
respective Indian counterparts.
In January this year, Indian Air Force Chief of
Staff S.P. Tyagi visited Japan and exchanged views

Chief of Indian Army Staff Singh meets GSDF Chief of Staff Oriki

with then ASDF Chief of Staff Yoshida. In April this
year, Indian Army Chief of Staff J.J. Singh visited
Japan and exchanged views with GSDF Chief of Staff
Ryoichi Oriki.
In April this year, Indian Defense Secretary
Shekhar Dutt visited Japan and held a Japan-India
Defense Policy Dialogue with Japanese Vice Minister
of Defense Takemasa Moriya by upgrading the
previous Vice Defense Minister-level meeting. Moriya
and Dutt exchanged views on how to deepen defense
exchanges between the two countries in the future and
regional situations. Indian Air Force Chief Tyagi meets ASDF Chief of Staff Yoshida (then)


**(2) Regular Consultations between Defense Officials**
In February last year, Japan and India held Director-General level/Councilor-level talks of defense officials and
exchanged views with each other about defense exchanges between the two countries and the regional
situation. Furthermore, Japan and India have promoted research exchanges, including acceptance of each
other’s defense officials as students and mutually dispatching their researchers on defense issues.


-----

**(3) Exchange between Units**

The MSDF and the Indian Navy have frequently
visited each other’s country in the past with MSDF
vessels on overseas training cruises, for example,
conducting a goodwill exercise with units of the Indian
Navy for the promotion of unit-to-unit exchanges
between the two countries. In April of this year, three
vessels of the Indian Navy paid a port call in Japan,
marking the 15th visit to Japan by an Indian Navy
warship. During the Indian vessels’ visit, Japan, the
United States and India conducted a trilateral joint
maritime exercise.
The music band of the Indian Army participated in
an SDF Marching Festival held in November last year.

**7. Defense Exchanges with Southeast Asian Countries**
Southeast Asian countries are situated in areas deemed as strategically important for maritime traffic, and they
also have close economic relations with Japan. Therefore, promoting dialogue between Japan and these
countries on security issues and deepening relations of mutual trust and cooperation are of great importance for
both sides.
In August of last year, then Japanese Minister of State for Defense Fukushiro Nukaga held talks with
Indonesian Defense Minister Juwono Sudarsono and agreed that Japan and Indonesia will promote dialogue
and cooperation in the fields of maritime security and disaster-relief operations.
In January this year, Japanese Defense Minister Fumio Kyuma visited Thailand and held talks with Thai
Defense Minister Boonrawd Somtas. During the meeting, the ministers of Japan and Thailand deepened their
mutual understanding about defense policies of their countries and the regional situation.
The recent high-level exchanges between Japan and Southeast Asian countries are shown in Fig. III-3-2-2.
This shows how defense relations between Japan and these countries have steadily progressed.

In addition to exchanges by high-level officials, Japanese defense officials have held consultations with
working-level defense officials from Southeast Asian countries on a regular basis to promote discussions on
security and defense issues involving both sides and build relations of mutual understanding and confidence.
Japan and Southeast Asian countries have also steadily promoted staff talks between defense staff
organizations, exchanges of researchers and students as well as units including port visits. Through these
defense relations, Japan and Southeast Asian countries have been able to lay the foundation for building a
multilateral defense network, which would play an important role for realizing peace and stability in the region.

**8. Defense Exchanges with Other Countries**
In addition to neighboring countries described above, Japan has promoted defense exchanges with many other
countries.
The Defense Ministry has held high-level exchanges, working-level consultations and student exchanges
with many other countries around the world. Among them are Pakistan, a country which has played an
important role in global efforts to fight against terrorism, Canada, a country with which Japan had undertaken
the U.N. peacekeeping operations in the Golan Heights, Asia-Pacific countries like Mongolia, and countries
related to the SDF’s aid mission in Iraq like Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), European countries,
and international organizations such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
On unit-to-unit levels, mutual visits by vessels have been frequent along with mutual exchanges between
SDF units and units of foreign militaries belonging to countries where Japan’s international peace cooperation
operations are underway.
The recent high-level defense exchanges between Japan and other countries are shown in Fig. III-3-2-3.
This indicates Japan has endeavored to build close cooperative relations with many foreign countries in defense
areas.
In September last year, then Japanese Minister of State for Defense Fukushiro Nukaga visited Mongolia
and held talks with Mongolian Defense Minister Mishigiyn Sonompil. Also in September, Nukaga held talks
with Canadian Defense Minister Gordon O’Connor. In October last year, Minister of State for Defense Fumio
Kyuma held talks with New Zealand Defense Minister Phil Goff, exchanging views with them over the
regional situation and international peace cooperation activities. In May this year, Defense Minister Kyuma

**[COLUMN]**

**VOICE**

**Studying at the NATO Defense College**

**Lieutenant Colonel Taro Omori, ASDF**
**NATO Defense College student (currently Air Staff Office)**

I studied in the Senior Course 109 at the NATO Defense College in Rome from August 28, 2006 to
February 2, 2007. The NATO Defense College accepts 70 to about 80 colonel/lieutenant colonel-class
officers or civil officers of equivalent rank from more than 30 friendly countries including the NATO
member countries and the Partnership for Peace (PfP) countries for each Senior Course. The course was
held twice a year to provide strategic level education so that the participants can be assigned to NATOrelated posts in the future.
The studying environment was superb with prominent professors, ambassadors, soldiers and other
experts invited every day from various countries to give a high-quality lecture and to have discussion with


-----

us. In addition, the course offered us an opportunity to
visit more than 10 countries in Europe, North America
and other regions as field study to check what I had
learnt in the class at actual sites. Furthermore, focus
was also placed on learning negotiation and decisionmaking skills in the multinational environment where it
is not easy to reach a consensus among people from
different political, economical and cultural
backgrounds. In this way, the curriculum of this course
was well thought out to build a foundation on which
NATO can work smoothly.

Lieutenant Colonel Omori discussing at the NATO Defense College

NATO is often referred to as the most successful (far left)
military alliance in history. NATO has been actively promoting a reform through careful deliberations
since the end of the Cold War-the 9/11 terrorist attacks in particular. The future direction that NATO will
take is similar to that of Japan, and the study at the college made me realize that Japan and NATO need to
further enhance their mutual cooperation to appropriately deal with new global threats.
I would like to contribute to the development of the Japan-NATO relationships in the future as well by
making the most of these precious experiences I had at the college.

**3. Multilateral Security Dialogue**

**1. Significance of Multilateral Security Dialogue**
Multilateral security dialogue is extremely significant because participating countries can increase their mutual
understanding and relations of mutual trust by exchanging views on security issues of mutual concern. Such
security dialogue can also effectively contribute to bringing about regional peace and stability, with concerned
countries tackling issues that affect multiple countries while making coordination and cooperation.

**2. ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF)**
At the ASEAN foreign ministers meeting and ASEAN Post-Ministerial Conference in 1993, the foreign
ministers from these 17 countries and those from the European Community (EC), now the European Union
(EU), agreed to create the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) as a political and security forum in the Asia-Pacific
region. Since its first ministerial meeting in 1994, the number of members of the ARF has gradually increased
as the forum has held its regular meeting annually. At present, the number of members stands at 25 countries
and one organization[32].
The ARF is not a type of security organization as seen in Europe but the ARF has significance because it
provides opportunities for member countries to send both diplomatic and defense officials to various intergovernmental meetings.
The Ministry of Defense believes that it is necessary for defense officials among ARF member countries to
enhance mutual confidence during the process of the ARF so that the ARF would become a forum to generate a
sense of being part of one community among its members, and thereby stabilize the region’s security
environment. From this perspective, the Ministry of Defense has been continuing its efforts to deepen mutual
understanding within the ARF by continuing to participate in the ARF process, by encouraging ARF members
to increase the transparency of their defense policies and by promoting frank discussion among members’
defense officials.


-----

In recent years, ARF member countries have been actively exchanging their views on common regional
security issues including international disaster-relief activities, maritime security and peacekeeping activities.
The Ministry of Defense has been actively taking part in such discussion being made among ARF countries.
The ARF has held the Senior Officials Meeting (SOM), the Inter-Sessional Support Group (ISG) Meeting
on Confidence-Building Measures and Preventive Diplomacy (CBM[33]/PD) and the ARF Security Policy
Conference in addition to the Foreign Ministerial Meeting every year. Aside from the so-called Plenary
Meeting, which is composed of foreign and defense ministry officials from the ARF member countries, defense
officials have convened their own “Defense Officials Dialogue” in advance of the Plenary Meeting. Since the
2002 Foreign Ministerial Meeting, Japan Defense Ministry has steadily increased its involvement in the ARF,
actively participating in these meetings, and frankly exchanging views with defense officials from other ARF
member countries.

**3. Multilateral Security Dialogue Sponsored or Participated in by the Japan Defense Ministry and**
**the SDF**

The Defense Ministry believes that it is important for Japan to take the initiative in multilateral security
dialogue in order to promote relations of mutual confidence and cooperation among defense officials of Japan
and other countries through information exchanges and discussions. The Defense Ministry also believes that by
doing so, Japan can contribute to making the Asia-Pacific region stable. Thus, the Defense Ministry has
sponsored various seminars to promote multilateral security dialogue while it has also actively participated in
such forums sponsored by foreign countries and other organizations. (See Figs. III-3-2-5 • 6)
In particular, the Forum for Defense Authorities in the Asia-Pacific Region (Tokyo Defense Forum) has
been sponsored by the Ministry of Defense every year since 1996. The Forum is designed to contribute to the
stability of the Asia-Pacific region by deepening mutual understanding among participating countries on each
other’s defense policy and increasing the transparency of their defense policies. In the forum, defense officials
of participating countries have exchanged views on defense policies, and efforts being made by each country to
foster mutual trust in the field of defense.
The 11th Tokyo Defense Forum in October last year was participated in by 23 countries, European Union
(EU), U.N. OCHA and the ASEAN Secretariat. The participants exchanged views under the agenda of “Efforts
to Develop Strategies and Procedures for International Cooperation and Civil-Military Coordination in Disaster
Relief Operations”.
The IISS Asia Security Conference is an international conference being held annually in Singapore under
the sponsorship of an organization in the private sector and is the only conference being participated in by a
large number of defense ministers in the Asia-Pacific region.
As the head of Japanese delegation, Minister of
Defense Fumio Kyuma participated in this conference
in June this year, delivering a speech[34] on “Nuclear
Challenges.” In the speech, Kyuma clarified Japan’s
basic policy on nuclear issues and emphasized that
North Korea issues such as nuclear development were
an issue that should be tackled by the international
community as a whole. He then explained the Japanese
Ministry of Defense’s efforts to prevent proliferation
of weapons of mass destruction and appealed for
international cooperation to tackle this issue. Parliamentary Secretary of Defense Omae delivering speech at 11th Tokyo

**4. Multilateral Exercises**

**1. Significance of Multilateral Exercises in the Asia-Pacific Region**
The Defense Ministry and the SDF consider participating in or hosting multilateral exercises will contribute not
only to improving their maneuvering skills but also to helping establish the foundation for building cooperative
relationship among participating countries through cooperation and exchange of views.
Since 2000, multilateral exercises involving various elements such as humanitarian assistance, disaster
relief and non-combatant evacuation operations, have been conducted in the Asia-Pacific region, in addition to
conventional combat exercises.
Specific exercises thus far conducted on a multilateral basis include refugee rescue training held as part of
the Rim of the Pacific Exercise in 2000, the “Cobra Gold” Exercise conducted by the United States, Thailand
and other countries focusing on humanitarian assistance and peace-enforcement activities, and the exercise for
submarine rescue drills in the West Pacific, which was hosted by Singapore in 2000, Japan in 2002 and the
Republic of Korea (ROK) in 2004.
The Defense Ministry and the SDF will continue to participate in these multilateral exercises proactively
and on their own initiative.

**2. Efforts on multilateral Exercises in the Asia-Pacific Region**


**(1) Hosting Multilateral Exercises**
The MSDF hosted “Pacific Reach 2002” in April
2002, a multilateral exercise for submarine rescue
drills in the West Pacific[35]. This was the first time
Japan hosted a multilateral exercise. In October 2002,
the MSDF hosted the Multilateral Search and Rescue
Exercises[36].
The SDF has sent its officers to the annual Cobra
Gold exercises since 2005. In May this year, SDF
officers participated in a command post exercise for
U.N. peacekeeping activities and joined a medical
division of humanitarian and civic assistance activities.
Multilateral exercises in which the SDF recently
participated are shown in Fig. III-3-2-7.

**(2) Inviting Observers to Multilateral Exercises**
The SDF invited officers from eight countries in the Asia-Pacific region to Japan in September 2001 to observe
the fourth Japan-Russia Search and Rescue Exercise. Since then, the SDF has been stepping up efforts to invite
observers from foreign countries to multilateral exercises being sponsored by the SDF.
The GSDF has invited working-level officers from countries mainly in the Asia-Pacific region to Japan to
participate in the Multinational Cooperation Program in the Asia-Pacific (MCAP), which it has hosted annually
since 2002 as part of its multilateral cooperation. (See Fig. III-3-2-8)

Section 3. Efforts for Arms Control, Disarmament and Non-Proliferation
(The preamble)

In recent years, the international community firmly recognizes the new threat of proliferation of weapons of
mass destruction (WMD), missiles as their means of delivery, and related equipment and materials to terrorists
and countries of concern. Addressing non-proliferation issues, such as restricting or controlling export of these
weapons and their means of delivery, is a pressing issue for peace and stability of the international society
today.
Meanwhile, international public opinion calling for restricting certain conventional weapons is also on the
rise from a humanitarian point of view and it is an important challenge for each country to tackle the issue of
certain conventional weapons by striking a balance between the humanitarian requirement and the defense
necessity.
As an effort to cope with these challenges, a system aimed at promoting arms control, disarmament and
non-proliferation is established in cooperation with each country in the world. (See Fig. III-3-3-1)

proliferation of other weapons of mass destruction and missiles as their means of delivery, and a global effort
to restrict certain conventional weapons.
This section will explain about efforts being made by the Defense Ministry and the SDF regarding
endeavors by the United Nations and other international organizations on arms control, disarmament and nonproliferation of weapons.

**1. Efforts on Treaties related to Arms Control, Disarmament and Non-Proliferation of**
**Weapons of Mass Destruction**

**1. Nuclear Weapons**

**(1) Relevant Treaties**
Treaties related to control of nuclear arms, disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation, and export-control
systems are shown in Fig. III-3-3-2.

**Fig. III-3-3-2 Treaties Related to Arms Control, Disarmament and Non-Proliferation, Regarding Weapons of Mass**
**Destruction and Other Weapons (nuclear weapons)**

|Classification|Treaties|Outline (Purpose and Others)|
|---|---|---|
|Arms Control, Disarmament, Non- Proliferation Related Treaties|Treaty on the Non- Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)1|• Nuclear non-proliferation The NPT recognizes the five countries—the United States, Russia, the U.K., France and China—as nuclear weapon states. It prohibits acquisition of nuclear arms by non-nuclear weapon states. • Nuclear disarmament The NPT obliges nuclear weapon states to pursue negotiations on nuclear disarmament in good faith. • Peaceful use of nuclear energy The NPT recognizes the “inalienable” right of signatory states to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. (Article 4-1) The NPT obliges non-nuclear weapon states to accept safeguards by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)2 to verify that they are not diverting nuclear energy for peaceful use to military technologies. (Article 3) • The NPT entered into force in 1970. • There are 190 signatory countries to the NPT.|
||Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT)3|• The CTBT prohibits any nuclear weapon test explosion or any other nuclear explosion by signatory states at any place in the world, including outer space, the atmosphere, underwater and underground. • The CTBT has been signed by 177 states and ratified by 137 states. (Of 44 designated countries whose ratification is necessary for the treaty’s enforcement, 41 countries have ratified it) • All of the 44 states need to ratify the treaty so that it can enter into force. But some of states which have yet to ratify the treaty are uncertain if they will ratify it. As a result, the treaty has yet to enter into force.|
|Export Control System for Non- Proliferation|Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG)4|• The NSG is a group of nuclear supplier countries which seeks to prevent proliferation of nuclear weapons by controlling exports of materials, equipment and technologies that could be used for development of nuclear arms. • The NSG was formed in 1978 following a nuclear test by India in 1974. • The group consists of 45 countries.|

**Destruction and Other Weapons (biological and chemical weapons)**

|Classification|Treaties|Outline (Purpose and Others)|
|---|---|---|
|Arms Control, Disarmament, Non- Proliferation Related Treaties|Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC)1|The CWC pursues to abolish chemical weapons by prohibiting signatory states from developing, producing, acquiring, stockpiling, retaining, transferring or using such weapons and obliging them to destroy the weapons if they own them. A strict verification system has been established to make the implementation of the convention effective. The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) was established in The Hague, the Netherlands in 1997 in order to implement verification measures stipulated under the CWC following its enforcement. The CWC entered into force in 1997. CWC signatory states: 182 countries.|

3. See <http://www.mofa.go.jp/mofaj/gaiko/bwc/ag/index.html>

**(2) Japan’s Efforts**
**a. Since 1980, the Defense Ministry and the SDF have dispatched GSDF experts on protection from chemical**
weapons to the negotiations to draft the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC). Since 1997, when the
convention came into effect, GSDF experts on protection from chemical weapons have been dispatched to the
Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), which was established in the Hague, the
Netherlands, to implement verification measures stipulated in the
convention. (See Reference 53)
The Chemical School of the GSDF, located in Saitama City,
Saitama Prefecture, has synthesized a small quantity of chemical
materials to research protective measures, which are subject to
regulations of the convention. In line with the regulations, the
school has opened its facilities to inspection by the OPCW six
times since the OPCW’s establishment.
The Government of Japan has been working on the project to
dispose of chemical weapons that were abandoned in China in line
with the CWC. Past investigations have shown that an estimated
300,000 to 400,000 chemical weapons that were abandoned by the

GSDF officers being dispatched to OPCW [From left are

former Imperial Japanese Army in China remain buried in the Colonel Urano (Head of Operation and Planning Branch of
Haerbaling District, Dunhua City, Jilin Province. Inspectorate Division), Major General Akiyama (Director of

Inspectorate Division) and Major Shinkai(Inspector)]


-----

The Defense Ministry and the SDF have cooperated in the project by sending four officials, including
GSDF officers, to the Cabinet Office, which is in charge of the project. The Defense Ministry has also
dispatched GSDF officers specializing in chemistry and ammunition disposal to China to help the excavation
and collection of the abandoned weapons.
Since 1999, SDF officers have been so far dispatched to China for six times for the disposal of discarded
chemical weapons in the country. From August to September of last year, eight SDF officers were sent to Han
Xianyao, Dunhua City, Jilin Province where they identified the excavated shells and took measures to prevent
them from being activated and exploding.

**b. Regarding the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of**
Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxic Weapons and on Their Destruction (Biological Weapons Convention or
BWC), Japan has dispatched GSDF officers with expertise in pharmacology and medicine to related
conferences such as multilateral negotiations meant for introducing BWC verification measures, aimed at
supporting global efforts to reinforce the convention.

**c. Regarding the Australia Group (AG), Japan has sent officials to the AG’s annual meeting since 1994 in order**
to support global efforts to make regulations and rules set by the group effective.

**3. Delivery Means (Missiles)**

**(1) Relevant agreements**
International political agreements regarding control of weapons-delivery means, disarmament and nonproliferation of such means, and export control systems are shown in Fig. III-3-3-4.

**2. Efforts on Arms Control-Related Treaties on Certain Conventional Weapons**

**1. Relevant Treaties**
Shown in Fig. III-3-3-5 are treaties and export-control systems related to arms control, disarmament and nonproliferation of certain conventional weapons whose use are deemed inhumane.

**Fig. III-3-3-5 Treaties Related to Arms Control for Certain Conventional Weapons**

|Classification|Treaties|Outline|
|---|---|---|
|Arms Control, Disarmament, Non- Proliferation Related Treaties|Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons1|• The CCW is designed to prohibit or restrict the use of certain conventional weapons which may be deemed to be excessively injurious or to have indiscriminate effects, such as land mines and booby traps. • The CCW entered into force in 1983. • Signatory states: 102 countries|
||Convention on Anti- Personnel Mines (Ottawa Convention)2|• The convention totally prohibits the use mines, stockpiling, production and transfer of anti-personnel while obligating signatory states to destruct stockpiled mines within four years and remove laid mines within 10 years.

**2. Japan’s Efforts**

**(1) The Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional**
**Weapons Which May Be Deemed to Be Excessively Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate**
**Effects (Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, or CCW)**

In recent years, negotiations and reviews have been underway among the States Parties to work out ways to
reduce the humanitarian risks caused by the explosive remnants of war (ERW), such as unexploded ordnance.
At their meeting in 2003, CCW States Parties adopted Protocol V, which concerns post-conflict remedial
measures of a generic nature in order to reduce the risks of ERW. The protocol entered into force in November
last year.


-----

At the third review conference in November last year, the State Parties recognized the need for the global
community to take urgent action to problems caused by the ERW, particularly by unexploded cluster munitions
(munitions that eject multiple sub munitions), and decided[37] to focus their discussion on such munitions.
Japan has decided to address issues related to cluster munitions while striking a balance between giving
humanitarian consideration and keeping defense need[38]. Based on this idea, the Defense Ministry has
dispatched its officials to the Meeting of the States Parties and the Groups of Governmental Experts of CCW,
both of which are held to discuss and negotiate the addition of a protocol.

**(2) Convention on Anti-Personnel Mines**
The Defense Ministry and the SDF began disposal of the anti-personnel mines in January 2000. Japan
completed the destruction of all anti-personnel mines in February 2003, with the exception of a minimum
number of anti-personnel mines necessary for the development of and training in mine detection or mine
clearance techniques, as permitted by the Ottawa Convention.
Meanwhile, the Defense Ministry, in order to ensure Japan’s national security, has been acquiring “an antipersonnel obstacle system,” an alternative to anti-personnel mines that would not be banned by the convention
and would not cause harm to civilians, which will be used for the time being, combining directional
fragmentation charges[39].
Although 153 countries have signed the convention as of February this year, only 12 out of 25 ARF
member countries have joined the convention. The Defense Ministry has thus been encouraging ARF member
countries that have yet to sign the convention to do so.
Furthermore, the Defense Ministry has actively supported[40] the international efforts in the problem of antipersonnel mines by annually reporting to the United Nations the data regarding exceptional possession and by
sending its officials to relevant international meetings.

**(3) System of the U.N. Register of Conventional Arms**
As well as registering with the United Nations annual data on imports of its defense equipment, the Defense
Ministry has provided[41] information on its possession, domestic procurement and the transfer of small arms on
a voluntary basis.
Moreover, officials of the Defense Ministry have been dispatched from time to time to expert meetings and
others aimed at improving and strengthening the U.N. Register of Conventional Arms.

**3. International Efforts for Non-Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction and Others**

**1. Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI)**

**(1) Background behind Adoption of the PSI**
In December 2002, the Bush administration, alleging that states suspected of weapons proliferation, such as
North Korea and Iran, have been seeking to possess weapons of mass destruction (WMD), announced the
National Strategy Against WMD, which sought a three-point comprehensive approach to such weapons:
countermeasures against proliferation, non-proliferation and response to the consequences of the use of WMD.
As part of such approach, President George W. Bush announced in May 2003 the Proliferation Security
Initiative (PSI)[42]. The initiative had garnered support from more than 80 countries, including Japan, as of
February this year.


-----

**(2) Past Achievements of PSI and Japan’s Efforts**
PSI Participating countries have agreed to a Statement of Interdiction Principles[43], which stipulates the
purposes of the PSI and principles of interdiction, and have conducted exercises for ground, maritime and air
interdiction operations so each participating country can enhance its interdiction capability to implement the
PSI. A total of 26 interdiction exercises have been conducted by April this year.
In addition to conducting these interdiction exercises, participating countries have held plenary meetings
(high-level policy meetings) and meetings of Operational Expert Working Groups in order to examine policyrelated and legal issues. As a result of these PSI activities, participating countries were able to handle actual
interdiction cases successfully, for example the BBC China Incident[44].
Given the objective of the PSI is consistent with its security need, Japan has played an important role in
PSI as one of its core members for some time since the establishment of PSI in 2003.
Japan has also actively participated in PSI’s efforts as a member of its Operational Expert Working Group,
consisting of 20 countries[45] at present.

**(3) Efforts by the Defense Ministry and the SDF**
The Defense Ministry and the SDF think it necessary to actively commit to PSI by making maximum use of the
SDF’s defense capability while keeping cooperation with relevant organizations and countries. Japan has taken
part in information-gathering activities, including dispatching Defense Ministry staff to PSI-related meetings
since the third PSI plenary meeting in Paris, and sending officials to PSI interdiction exercises as observers.
Through these activities, the Defense Ministry and the SDF believe they can play an important role in the
PSI by providing relevant organizations and countries with information gathered in patrol and surveillance
operations by the SDF’s vessels and aircraft during PSI interdiction operations. The Defense Ministry and the
SDF also believe that they can play other roles in maritime interdiction operations, including stopping
suspicious ships and conducting on-the-spot inspections, in cooperation with the Japan Coast Guard, in the
event of an issuance of an order for maritime security operations.
Based on the belief, Japan has actively participated in PSI interdiction exercises. In October 2004, the
Defense Ministry and the SDF, along with the Foreign Ministry and the Japan Coast Guard, sponsored an
exercise for PSI maritime interdiction operations[46]. Participants in the exercise demonstrated their training on
boarding a suspicious ship and conducting an on-the-spot inspection there.
As part of “outreach” activities aimed at strengthening the comprehensive non-proliferation regime,
including the PSI, the Defense Ministry and the SDF have positively provided the national defense authorities
of other Asian countries with information and knowledge that they have obtained through their past interdiction
exercises in a bid to promote understanding by these Asian countries concerning the PSI. (See Fig. III-3-3-6)

**(4) Future Efforts**
Under the New National Defense Program Guidelines, Japan, in a bid to further solidify its peace and security,
has pledged to participate proactively and on its own initiative in activities being conducted by the global
community to improve the international security environment. In addition, the Mid-Term Defense Program
calls for Japan to participate in joint exercises on international peace cooperation activities, including the PSI.
In light of cases, including the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction in areas surrounding Japan,
Japan should do its utmost to prevent proliferation of such weapons by regarding the PSI as a broadly defined
security issue including defense, diplomacy, law execution and export control and by tackling the issue
proactively and on its own initiative even during peacetime.
Therefore, Japan will positively commit itself to PSI activities. In order to expedite its commitment to the
activities, Japan will try to establish an ideal organizational structure within the Government in close
cooperation with relevant organizations.

From a viewpoint of improving the SDF’s response capability, Japan will consider participating in various
interdiction exercises and sponsoring such exercises in the future.

**2. U.N. Security Council Resolution 1540 Concerning Non-Proliferation of Weapons of Mass**
**Destruction**

In April 2004, the U.N. Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution against the proliferation of
weapons of mass destruction under Chapter 7 of the U.N. Charter, affirming that proliferation of nuclear,
chemical and biological weapons as well as their means of delivery, constitutes a threat to international peace
and security and therefore the United Nations is prepared to take adequate and effective action against such
threats. U.N. Security Council Resolution 1540 Concerning Non-Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction
urges all U.N. Member States to 1) refrain from providing any form of support to non-State actor from
attempting to develop WMD and their means of delivery, 2 adopt and enforce appropriate and effective laws
which prohibit any non-State actor from manufacturing WMD and their means of delivery, in particular for
terrorist purposes, and 3) establish effective border-controls and export-controls to prevent the proliferation of
WMD and their means of delivery.
Recognizing that the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction could disturb peace and stability of the
international community, including Japan, and that preventing such weapons from proliferating to terrorists and
other non-State actors is an urgent task, Japan supports the U.N. resolution and holds expectations that all U.N.
Member States will observe the resolution.

number of countries with whom notes were exchanged to 11. These notes stipulate that Japan’s
cooperation and support activities are based on the Anti-Terrorism Special Measures Law. The
Government of Japan has also repeatedly explained to Japan’s cooperation and support-recipient
countries that goods provided to these countries as part of such activities are to be used appropriately so
as to serve the purposes envisaged under the Anti-Terrorism Special Measures Law, and may not be
transferred to third parties without the prior consent of Japan. The recipient countries have accepted

35) The MSDF dispatched two vessels to the first submarine rescue exercise in the Western Pacific called
“Pacific Reach 2000,” hosted by the Singaporean Navy in 2000. In the 2002 exercise, the second of its
kind, 10 vessels from five countries, including three vessels sent by the MSDF, participated. Techniques
to rescue submarines were demonstrated in waters west of Kyushu.
36) Multilateral search and rescue exercises were conducted mainly in waters south of the Kanto region to
help participating vessels get accustomed to procedures and main points which are necessary when
searching for or rescuing wrecked vessels. MSDF ships posing as wrecked commercial vessels were used
for the exercise. Participating countries: Japan, India, Australia, the Republic of Korea, Singapore,
Thailand, New Zealand, France and Russia (nine countries).
37) Study is underway within the framework of the CCW to solve problems related to cluster munitions.
There are also moves outside the CCW framework to seek prohibition of the use of cluster munitions that
cause intolerable harm to civilians, including an international conference held in Oslo in February this
year and a similar conference in Lima in May.
38) Given Japan being an island country which has a long coastal line around the country, it is extremely
important for Japan to take swift action in the wake of landing operations by an enemy country and
various other emergency situations in order to smash its military units which are being deployed widely to
invade Japan. Japan has owned cluster munitions, which have effective firepower to expeditiously bring
wider areas under control, judging the possession of such munitions by a country which has adopted an
exclusively defense-oriented policy is necessary for the defense of the country. Japan has no plans to use
cluster munitions overseas. When facing the situation in which the use of cluster munitions in Japan has
become necessary, the Government will do its utmost for appropriate evacuation of citizens.

39) Anti-infantry combat explosives for obstructing the approach of enemy’s infantry. In order that citizens
are not injured indiscriminately, these explosives are actuated while the target is being watched by SDF
personnel using them. They are not designed to explode by the presence, approach or contact by humans.
40) Between 1999 and December 2006, the Defense Ministry recommended to Japan International
Cooperation Agency (JICA) retired GSDF officers for supporting antipersonnel landmine removal
activities in Cambodia. So far, two retired officers were dispatched as a maintenance and transportation
advisor to the Cambodian Mine Action Center (CMAC) under the framework of JICA’s long-term
dispatch of an expert.
41) In 2005 reporting, only five countries out of the ARF members—Australia, Canada, Japan, the United
States and New Zealand—provided information. Among them, only Japan provided information on the
transfer of small arms.
42) The PSI is a proposal intended to encourage participating countries to join forces in taking possible
measures in line with existing international and domestic laws in order to prevent proliferation of
materials related to weapons of mass destruction, and at the same time for each country to make possible
efforts to strengthen relevant international and domestic laws.
43) Under the Statement of Interdiction Principles, PSI participating countries are committed to join hands in
stopping weapons of mass destruction and related materials from flowing to and from states and non-state
actors that raise proliferation concerns. The Statement also calls on all countries concerned about the
proliferation to support the PSI and join forces with PSI participants in taking possible measures to stop
the flow of such weapons, with the willingness to implement them. Under the Statement, all countries that
have a stake in non-proliferation are committed to take specific actions to prevent the proliferation of
weapons of mass destruction as much as possible within the range of related international law and
domestic law.
44) In September 2003, the German Foreign Ministry obtained information that BBC China, a vessel whose
registered nationality was Antigua and Barbuda, an island country in the Caribbean Sea, was heading for
Libya to transport nuclear-related materials. The German Government dispatched intelligence experts to
Italy, and conducted an inspection of the ship with the cooperation of the Italian Government and the U.S.
Navy. The inspection revealed that the ship’s container number was fabricated. The German Government
confiscated the nuclear-related equipment (aluminum-made tubes that can be converted into centrifugals)
after the ship was brought to Taranto, Italy. This incident helped unearth Libya’s nuclear development
program and the so-called “Khan Network,” underlining the effectiveness of the PSI.
45) The United States, Japan, Britain, Italy, France, the Netherlands, Germany, Spain, Portugal, Australia,
Poland, Singapore, Norway, Canada, Russia, Turkey, Greece, Denmark, New Zealand and Argentina
46) Exercises for maritime interdiction operations, sponsored by Japan, were conducted in waters off Sagami
Bay and in Yokosuka Port in order to mainly improve interdiction abilities of relevant organizations of
participating countries, strengthen the mutual cooperation between Japan and participating countries, and
to promote understanding by non-PSI members of the PSI. Warships dispatched from such countries as
Australia, France and the United States participated in these exercises. From the SDF, vessels, aircraft and
others participated. The Japan Coast Guard joined the exercises with its patrol boats and aircraft.
Observers were sent to the exercises from 18 countries.

# Chapter 4

#### Citizens of Japan, the Ministry of Defense and the SDF

**Section 1. Sustaining Defense Capabilities**
**Section 2. Interaction between the Ministry of Defense & the SDF, and the Local Community &**
**Japanese Citizens**
**Section 3. Gaining the Trust of Japanese Citizens**


-----

No matter how the equipment and systems of the SDF are modernized, they must still be operated by people.
The full performance of equipment can only be achieved by individual personnel[1]. Moreover, regardless of any
strengthening of personnel and Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements, certain preconditions must be met. Namely,
without the understanding and support of the Japanese people, it will not be possible to protect Japan and fulfill
the goals of other activities, nor will it be possible to expect support from allies.
With the above background, this Chapter explains the following four aspects:

❍ The process from recruitment and employment, through education and training, to retirement and
outplacement of personnel.

❍ Details on information and communication systems, which is foundation of all equipment; improvements to
equipment and materials; prevention of information leaks; and related matters. (These are examined in
Section 1.)

❍ Activities by the Ministry of Defense and the SDF together with local communities, to gain the support of
the Japanese people (Section 2)

❍ Building trust among Japanese citizens in the Ministry of Defense and the SDF (Section 3)

Section 1. Sustaining Defense Capabilities

Defense capabilities depend on human resources. The operational efficiency of organizations depends on the
capabilities of their personnel, not only equipment and systems (for details on the organization of the Ministry
of Defense and the SDF, see Part II, Chapter 3, Section 3). Under the new security environment in recent years,
missions have become more diverse and international in character, and equipment within the Ministry of
Defense and the SDF has been improved. Human resources must therefore be improved too, which means
securing and training high-quality personnel.
The Ministry of Defense has worked to promptly and economically acquire equipment and materials to
meet such environmental changes, while focusing on the transparency and fairness of procurement. Moreover,
since leakage of information from the Ministry of Defense and the SDF could seriously threaten the defense of
Japan and cause other problems, information protection is crucial.
This section explains the development of human resources in the Ministry of Defense and the SDF, the
efficient procurement of equipment and materials, and the prevention of information leaks.

**1. Recruitment and Employment of Personnel in the Ministry of Defense and the SDF**

**1. Recruitment**

The Ministry of Defense and the SDF need highly
qualified personnel in order to fulfill their missions.
SDF Regular Personnel and other personnel of the
Ministry of Defense and the SDF are recruited and
employed under various systems[2]. (See Fig. III-4-1-1)
SDF Provincial Cooperation Offices (formerly
SDF Provincial Liaison Offices; reorganized in July
2006), which are located in 50 locations throughout
the nation (four in Hokkaido, and one in each of
Japan’s prefectures), conduct recruitment with the help
of prefectural and municipal governments, schools,
private recruitment counselors, and others. Local

Provincial Liaison Offices have changed to Provincial Cooperation Offices


-----

public organizations are also required to carry out administrative work for recruitment[3], and the Ministry of
Defense defrays the costs incurred by local public organizations.
However, with the declining birth rate in Japan, recruitment by the SDF will become increasingly difficult,
and so it is necessary to seek the assistance of local public organizations, related organizations, and other
community organizations. (See Fig. III-4-1-2) (See Reference 54)

adopts an early retirement system and a short-term service system to keep the forces strong. Under the early
retirement system, personnel retire at a younger age than general civilian government employees. Meanwhile,
under the short-term service system, employment may be completed in two or three years. Many of the Private
(GSDF), Seaman Apprentice (MSDF), and Airman Third Class (ASDF) personnel are employed under this
system. Upon employment, personnel who enlist in each SDF service complete the basic education and training
in a training unit or at a school of each SDF service, and are then assigned to units and positions nationwide.
The preferences and aptitude of each personnel are taken into consideration when assigning them to
occupational areas and positions, which are determined before they finish the basic education. (See Figs. III-41-3 • 4) (See Reference 55)

**Voice of a Newcomer (GSDF Enlisted (Upper) Candidate): My Best Colleagues**

**Leading Private Tsuyoshi Hiwatashi**
**Enlisted (Upper) Candidate**
**The 5th Anti-Aircraft Artillery Company**

The thing that I most appreciate about joining the
Self-Defense Forces is that I could meet many
good colleagues I can truly trust.
Newcomers receive about six-month training
immediately after joining the SDF.
During these six months, newcomers who have
met each other for the first time in the SDF spend
24 hours a day together, sleeping and dining in the
same place, and undergoing the same very hard
training.
Through this training immediately after joining
the SDF, newcomers learn the basics about being a Leading Private Hiwatashi (center) receiving training with his “best
SDF member that they all at lease need to know. colleagues”
But for us, who had had no knowledge about the SDF, the six months were full of uncertainties, and the
training was extremely hard.
A march training in which we walked for 24 km with heavy equipment on our back under the blazing
sun, fighting drills repeated again and again in pouring rain, physical strength trainings we had to receive
every day... Although there were many hard times, I was always together with my colleagues. We shared
the same goal, the same living environment, and the same hardships. This is why we could support,
encourage and trust each other. And when we support each other, we can overcome any hard training and
difficult time.
I am very glad to have chosen the SDF where I can share everything with my best colleagues.

It has been more than one year since I joined the Maritime Self-Defense Force and entered the Officer
Candidate School in Etajima. Since I joined the SDF after graduating from a general university,
everything in the MSDF is new to me, and every day is always fresh and invigorating. I was sometimes
complaining about the hard life at school in the beginning, particularly about cutter rowing (that made me
realize how heavy the oar is and how important the unity of the team is), one-day swimming
(implemented after training was provided in several phases), strict rules about clothing, postures and
behaviors, and everyday life in which everything is required to start and complete five minutes before the

set schedule. But thanks to other trainees who are my
rivals as well as friends with whom I can share
hardships and joys together, as well as to the support
from instructors who are strict yet considerate, I
could overcome many difficulties.
I graduated from the Officer Candidate School in
March this year, and am currently on a long exercise
cruise around the world as a trainee officer of the

**VOICE**

**Voice of a Newcomer (ASDF Student Pilot)**

**Staff Sergeant Kimihiro Kasamura, ASDF**
**ASDF Student Pilot**
**Student Unit, Student Pilot Training Group, the 12th Air Training Wing**

I have been always dreaming of flying since my
childhood. But it was when I was a junior high
school student and sat in the cockpit of an F-15
fighter for the first time at an open base festival that
I decided to fly with the fighter in the future and
became serious about making the dream come true.
I have been on the right way to fulfill my wish ever
since.
After graduating from a junior high school, I
became an ASDF youth cadet[1]. Then I took and
passed (only one out of 36 applicants could pass!)
an examination to become a student pilot. I am Staff Sergeant Kasamura, student pilot, during physical training
currently studying the basics about being a pilot on
the Student Pilot Course (two years) in the ASDF Hofu Air Base in Yamaguchi Prefecture as an air officer
candidate.
However, what I am studying now is not specific piloting techniques for flying. To fly, high
intelligence as an ASDF member and officer, as well as superior physical strength, are essential.
Furthermore, pilots are also required to be mentally strong so that they will remain cool in any situation
without being panicked. To be honest, the education and training at the school are very hard, and there are
even times I almost give up. But I am resolved to keep up with the instructions of instructors until I realize
my dream with my colleagues.
My dream is, as mentioned earlier, to become an F-15 fighter pilot. However although what I wanted
before joining the SDF was just to become a pilot and fly, I have now become aware of the importance of
protecting Japan, and am hoping to be engaged in an assignment to protect my mother country with an F-15
fighter. My main assignment when I successfully become a pilot will be to scramble to respond to aerial
invasion, and I think that it is challenging yet very honorable to be involved in defense activities to protect
Japan at the forefront.
When I proceed to the Flight Course, I will receive even harder education and training. But however
high the wall may be, and whenever I face difficulties, I will do everything I can to overcome them and
become a full-fledged pilot. Then I will work hard to protect the skies of Japan to maintain its peace.

**(2) SDF Ready Reserve Personnel, SDF Reserve Personnel, and Candidates for SDF Reserve**
**Personnel[8]**

**1) Purpose for Establishing the Reserve Personnel System**
Normally, the number of SDF Regular Personnel is kept to the minimum needed to respond to situations: SDF
Regular Personnel need to be available immediately in an emergency as the need arises. To meet such needs
promptly and systematically, there are three systems: the SDF Ready Reserve Personnel System, the SDF
Reserve Personnel System, and the System for Candidates for SDF Reserve Personnel[9].

**Fig. III-4-1-5 Overview of Systems Related to SDF Reserve Personnel**

|Col1|SDF Ready Reserve Personnel|SDF Reserve Personnel|Candidate for SDF Reserve Personnel|

-----

In particular, the System for Candidates for SDF Reserve Personnel, which is mainly for personnel without
experience, was established to develop and expand the defense basis, secure the stability of SDF Reserve
Personnel, and effectively use civilian expertise in fields such as medical practice and language skills. (See Fig.
III-4-1-5) (See Reference 56)

**VOICE**

**Voice of Reserve SDF Personnel: Having Participated**
**in a Japan-U.S. Combined Command Post Exercise**

**Reserve Sergeant First Class Aoi Tomita, GSDF**

Since I was dreaming of becoming an interpreter while
I was at college, I became, upon suggestion from a
Provincial Cooperation Office, a reserve technical
member (language) of the Self-Defense Forces in 2003.
Although I became gradually accustomed to wearing a
uniform and boots, acting in a unit, and using technical
terms of the SDF through training for reserve
personnel, I was concerned, as I had never experienced
working as an interpreter, if I could perform my duty
sufficiently even at the time when a contingency
occurs. While I had such a concern, I was provided

Reserve technical personnel (Reserve Sergeant First Class Tomita

with an opportunity to take part in a Japan-U.S. (center)) serving as interpreters during the Japan-U.S. combined
combined command post exercise for GSDF units in command post exercise in Hawaii
the State of Hawaii in the United States in July last year.
My first duty in Hawaii was to interpret for courtesy visits to U.S. army officers and a flower offering
ceremony at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific. Although I was not familiar with military
technical terms, I managed to fulfill my duty for these events thanks to the cooperation of others and prior
meetings. However, when we were guided around the cemetery after the flower offering ceremony and
given explanations such as episodes about soldiers buried in the cemetery who had fallen during the
World War II and Korean War, I could not interpret well although almost no military technical terms were
used in the explanation, and fully realized that my interpretation skills are not sufficient. After returning to
my accommodation, a veteran interpreter showed me his notebook used for note taking at the time of
interpretation, and taught me some knowhow including how to take notes. I became aware of the necessity
of developing my own techniques to provide smooth interpretation.
On the following day, the interpreters were allocated to each section of the exercise headquarters. I
was assigned to the section for making plans regarding civil affairs, legal affairs, patrolling, medicine and
other areas. The content of and the terms used for the conversations were highly technical, and the
conversation covered such a wide span of areas that I had to struggle with a different area each time I
interpret. I really had a hard time at the beginning. My interpretation was corrected, and there was even a
time when I was replaced by another interpreter. But by receiving explanations about technical terms, and
checking and clarifying every single unclear point, I could increase my vocabulary. I was also given a
longer time than usual to translate in the middle of a conversation. In this way, I could gradually expand
the scope of interpretation I can handle. From these experiences I realized that I need to know much more
technical terms.
By utilizing these precious experiences, I would like to play a part in maintaining peace of Japan and
the international society in the future.


-----

**2) Cooperation from Corporations Employing Personnel**
SDF Reserve Personnel and other personnel carry out their normal jobs, but are also expected to undergo
training to maintain the required skills. To attend such training, they take leave or vacation, or adjust their work
schedules accordingly. To function smoothly, such systems require the understanding and cooperation of the
employers of the personnel. SDF Ready Reserve Personnel, in particular, attend training for 30 days a year, so
employers need to allow Ready Reserve Personnel to take this leave and prepare for their absence.
To assist, the Ministry of Defense provides a special subsidy to companies and other organizations to cover
for their Ready Reserve Personnel when attending training sessions and the like. This reduces the burden on
such employers.

**(3) Administrative Officials, Technical and Engineering Officials, Instructors, and Other**
**Civilian Personnel**

There are approximately 24,000 civilian officials—Administrative Officials, Technical and Engineering
Officials, or Instructors, and others—in addition to SDF Regular Personnel at the Ministry of Defense and the
SDF. These civilians are mainly employed through the Class I Examination for National Civil Officials, or the
Class I, II, or III Examination for Ministry of Defense Civilian Officials. After participating in the same
training course, Class I and II personnel undertake a wide range of work.
Administrative Officials plan defense policies and manage the basic arrangement over control and
operation of the SDF at the Internal Bureau; handle intelligence activities of the Defense Intelligence
Headquarters (DIH); and carry out administrative functions (general affairs, measures to ensure harmony
between defense facilities and surrounding communities, and others) and provide logistic support
(maintenance, supply, and others) for SDF units throughout Japan.
Technical and Engineering Officials work at the Technical Research & Development Institute (TRDI) and
other organizations, where they conduct R&D to maintain and improve the nation’s technological defense
capabilities. Instructors’ duties include basic investigation and research on the management and operation of
the SDF at the National Institute for Defense Studies, and training of highly qualified personnel at
organizations such as the National Defense Academy and the National Defense Medical College.
At the end of March 2007, there were 586 Technical and Engineering Officials and Instructors with
doctoral degrees.
Moreover, in the various organizations where these civilian officials work, SDF Regular Personnel of the
ground, maritime and air forces work together with the civilians, mainly in fields where the special knowledge
of SDF Regular Personnel is required.

**2. Daily Education and Training[10]**

In order to accomplish its missions starting from the
defense of the country, the SDF needs to do more than
simply upgrade its equipment. Each member, from
commanding officers down, must possess excellent
knowledge and skills and be highly qualified, and each
unit must maintain a high level of proficiency.
Personnel must always be prepared to demonstrate
their capabilities in any situation, so that the SDF can
immediately and appropriately deal with various
situations and deter any country threatening to invade
Japan. GSDF paratrooper jumps out of plane

Education and training are crucial for the SDF to develop its human resources and strengthen its
capabilities, as described above. While working within constraints and making great effort to prevent accidents
and address other safety concerns, the SDF is committed to educating its personnel and training its units to
make them strong, and to maintaining and improving its readiness to respond to any situation.

**1. Education of SDF Regular Personnel**

**(1) Present Status of Education**
Highly proficient SDF Regular Personnel need to be trained properly if units are to perform their duties
successfully. At its schools and training units, the SDF provides a systematic phased education, starting from
basic education immediately after joining the SDF, to life-long learning to nurture the qualities necessary for
positions and duties, in order to cultivate quality, knowledge and skills.
When it is judged that personnel need to improve their professional knowledge and skills, or if it is difficult
for them to acquire such knowledge and skills within the SDF, they may study abroad, at external educational
institutions[11], domestic companies, research institutes, and similar organizations. Education is entrusted to such
organizations, and so a wide range of outside educational organizations is used to help personnel continuously
improve their qualifications, knowledge, and skills. (See Reference 57)

**(2) Joint Educational Programs**
The Joint Operations Posture was started in March 2006. Knowledge and skills regarding joint operations are
essential in order to develop the system, which is done primarily through joint educational programs.
Therefore, the SDF has enhanced education on joint operations at Staff Colleges[12] of each force, and at other
educational facilities. Additionally, a joint educational program system, anchored by the Joint Staff College[13],
has been set up. High-ranking SDF officers who will become Senior Unit Commanders and Senior Staff
receive joint educational programs at this College.

**(3) Educational Programs Meeting the Needs of the Times**
The SDF has increasing opportunities to take part in international activities, and is developing more active
relationships with other countries, and so has added language programs for English, Russian, Chinese, Korean,
Arabic, and other languages to its curricula. The SDF also accepts students from abroad to increase the
understanding of other countries. Furthermore, to help conduct international peace cooperation activities, the
SDF established the International Peace Cooperation Activities Training Unit assigned under the Central
Readiness Force of the GSDF in March 2007. (See Chapter 3, Section 1 • Reference 58 • 59)


-----

**2. SDF Training**

**(1) Training by Each Self-Defense Force**
There are two main types of training within units in the GSDF, MSDF, and ASDF: training for individual SDF
personnel to improve their proficiency in respective fields, and training for units to conduct systematic
operations.
Training for individuals is conducted one-on-one in stages based on occupational classification and
individual ability. Training for units is conducted by size of unit, from small to large, and large-scale
comprehensive training is also carried out to ensure that overall abilities can be exercised. (See Fig. III-4-1-6)

In addition to such training for national defense, training is given on the diverse roles required of the SDF
in recent years. Such roles include: responding to situations in areas surrounding Japan, dealing with incidents
related to suspicious boats and armed agents, protecting SDF facilities threatened by a major terrorist attack,
and joint training with other ministries, agencies, and local public institutions. (See Fig. III-4-1-7) (See Chapter
1, Section 2)

**(2) Joint Training**
In order to deploy defense capabilities most effectively in the event of an armed attack on Japan, the GSDF,
MSDF, and ASDF must conduct joint training during peacetime. Therefore, the SDF has been conducting joint
training involving two or more forces. Such joint training has been strengthened with the transition to a Joint
Operations Posture in March 2006.

**[COLUMN]**

**VOICE**

**Voice of an Instructor for the Ship Inspection Course (MSDF)**

**Lieutenant Commander Tetsuya Okumura, MSDF**
**Ship Inspection Leader, Guard Division, MSDF 1st Technical School**

I am an instructor at the Marine Self-Defense Force
1st Technical School and working as the Ship
Inspection Leader for the Ship Inspection Course.
The Ship Inspection Course is a relatively new
course established in FY 2001 after the suspicious
boat incident in waters off the Noto Peninsula in
1999.
Ship inspections performed by the MSDF are
classified roughly into three types depending on
which law the inspection is based on: “inspection
operations” as performed by boarding ships under
the Ship Inspection Operations Law, “boarding Trainees on the Ship Inspection Course (front) and instructors (behind)
inspections” as performed under the Japan Coast practicing on a training mock ship
Guard Law applied mutatis mutandis during guarding operations at sea, and “detention inspections” as
performed under the Law Concerning the Restriction of Maritime Transportation of Foreign Military
Supplies, etc., in Armed Attack Situation (Maritime Transportation Restriction Law) during defense
operations. The Ship Inspection Course provides training necessary for these inspections, such as the
procedures by which personnel sent from a destroyer boards a suspected vessel, inspects cargo, ship’s
papers, and each compartment, and carries out other necessary duties. However, because actions
authorized under each of the laws are different and complex, I am struggling every day as to how I can
ensure that trainees accurately understand the difference.
In addition, while the training of MSDF personnel is generally centered around the operation of
equipment and administrative procedures, the Ship Inspection Course focuses more on how to deal with
people—rather than machinery and paper—to perform inspections. Because there is a possibility that
people on a suspected vessel may commit a dangerous act, we place a particular focus on the usage of
pistols, clubs and other weapons so that trainees will learn how and when to use them under the applicable
law through practicing what they have learnt in classrooms. To ensure that trainees master all the skills
they have learnt, instructors spend time together with trainees even during the time other than during
training, such as while trainees study at night and on holidays, so that instructors can teach trainees at any
time upon request.
Through enabling instructors and trainees to spend time together in this way, the Ship Inspection
Course is designed to improve the skills of trainees within the limited period of only about four weeks,
and produce an atmosphere in which trainees voluntarily seek instructions from instructors—rather than
passively learning what is taught—throughout the entire period.


-----

Considering the recent international circumstances, there is always a possibility for the MSDF to
encounter a situation in which they will have to inspect a vessel. We instructors are therefore currently
making utmost efforts to train trainees into strong elite personnel who can perform various duties such as
ship inspections at any time.

**(3) Restrictions on Education and Training, and Responses**
Various facilities and equipment[14] are available for SDF training under near-wartime conditions, yet many
restrictions are imposed on their usage.
Particularly, restrictions[15] in maneuver areas, sea and airspace, and firing ranges where training is carried
out are becoming tighter along with the modernization of equipment and other changes. Such areas are not all
sufficient in size, are unevenly dispersed across the
nation, and have time limitations. Furthermore,
training under electronic warfare [16] conditions—
conducted as practical training—is limited by the need
to avoid radio wave interference.
To overcome these restrictions, each SDF makes
maximum use of its limited domestic maneuvering
area, by moving to large-scale maneuver areas and
other areas. Each SDF also strives to carry out training
under conditions similar to actual wartime by
conducting live-firing training and Japan-U.S.
combined joint exercises in the United States and

Annual fire training of medium range SAM by GSDF waters off the United States where there are training

conditions not possible in Japan. (See Fig. III-4-1-9)

**(4) Safety Management**
Because the SDF’s main mission is to defend Japan, SDF training and activities are inevitably accompanied by
risk, but accidents that cause injury or loss of property to the public or the loss of life of SDF personnel must be
avoided at all costs.
Continuous safety reviews and improvements are vital, and must be jointly handled by the Ministry of
Defense and the SDF. The Ministry of Defense and the SDF take great care to ensure the safety of aircraft
traffic and firing training at ordinary times, and prepare aeronautical safety radio facilities and equipment for
prevention and rescue in the event of marine accidents.

**3. Working Conditions of Personnel, Measures on Personnel Matters, and Other Related**
**Issues**

The duties of the SDF make no distinction between night and day, and SDF personnel must always be at the
ready to perform their duties. The work assigned to SDF Regular Personnel can be extremely demanding,
involving various operations onboard aircraft, long-term service on ships or submarines, or parachuting. To
instill SDF personnel with both pride and peace of mind in their work, the Ministry of Defense and the SDF
provide salaries and allowances, medical care, health & welfare, and benefits that reflect the special nature of
their duties. (See Fig. III-4-1-10)

**1. The Panel to Examine Comprehensive Reform in the Personnel Field of the Defense Force**
The Ministry of Defense has acknowledged the
significance of maintaining high-quality human
resources, and implemented various measures for the
new era[17]. Given the rapidly declining birth rate in
recent years and changes in lifecycles of SDF
personnel, a wide range of reforms, which focus on the
personnel field of the Defense Force, has become a
pressing issue, in order to secure sufficient human
resources and create a comfortable working
environment where personnel can concentrate on their
duties without anxiety. In September 2006, the Panel
to Examine Comprehensive Reforms in the Personnel

Meeting by the Panel to Examine Comprehensive Reform in the Personnel Field

Field of the Defense Force was established. The Panel of the Defense Force
is headed by the Minister of State for Defense (at the time), and includes top officials of the Defense Agency
(at the time) and outside experts. This Panel holds administrative meetings, headed by the Administrative Vice
Minister, and consists of six examining groups: 1) Examination Steering 2) General Issues; 3) Lifecycle; 4)
Appointment System and other Related Issues; 5) Ranking and Payment System; and 6) Financial Measures for
Retired Personnel.
Four discussion meetings have been held as of May 2007. In December 2006, various surveys by the Panel
were carried out, along with a survey with questionnaires targeted at 2,000 active-duty Regular Personnel and
1,000 retired SDF personnel. Based on these, issues concerning the personnel field of the defense force have
been identified, and ways of solving the issues were discussed in March 2007. These issues include expansion
of employment of non-fixed term SDF personnel, utilization of retired SDF personnel, review on personnel
management of SDF officers (i.e., increase in the number of young personnel who are promoted to officers and
decrease in the number of middle-aged or older personnel who are promoted to higher ranks), study of the pay
scale of officers and enlisted personnel, early retirement system, and measures to support life after retirement.

|---|---|---|
|Items|Measures by the Ministry of Defense and the SDF|Related governmental actions, and movements|
|Discussions on Reform of the Public Servant System|A new personnel evaluation system was introduced on a trial basis in January 2006. Laws have been organized: to set up a system which obliges personnel who leave their position soon after returning from overseas to reimburse overseas training expenses; to improve the system for personnel exchanges between the public and private sectors; and to introduce a system for leave of absence for self- development. These laws have been prepared in accordance with those applied to other Ministries and Agencies. In response to the submission of the Diet bill to partially revise the National Civil Service Law and related regulations, study is underway on laws that will be applied to SDF personnel, considering the specific features of the special service.|Reform of the Public Servant System (Approved in the Cabinet meeting on April 24, 2007)|
|Efforts for Gender- Equality|The Defense Agency Headquarters for the Promotion of a Gender-Equal Society was established in 2001, with the Senior Vice-Minister for Defense heading the organization. It has implemented various measures. In 2006, the headquarters drew up the Basic Plan on Gender Equality in the Defense Agency and made other decisions to promote: the expansion of recruitment and employment of female personnel; support for female personnel to balance work with family life; the improvement of facilities and accommodation on ships and other work areas to fit situations where more and more female personnel are placed.|Gender-Equal Society Law (1999)1|
|Promotion of Measures to Support the Development of the Next Generation|The Defense Agency Committee for the Promotion of Measures to Support the Development of the Next Generations was established.

(In particular, encouraging male personnel to take child-care leave and special leave, and establishing day care centers on the premises of the Ministry of Defense and the SDF)|Law for Measures to Support the Development of the Next Generation (2003)2|
|Approaches to Mental Health|The Defense Agency Headquarters for the Prevention of Suicide was established in 2003. It has discussed measures to prevent suicides, and distributed referential materials on suicide prevention to garrisons and bases. Efforts to enhance the awareness of SDF personnel have been made through improvement in a counseling system, and the production and dissemination of educational videos. Measures on Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and stress disorder, resulting from critical incidents, have been examined as one of the issues on mental health.||
|Active Utilization of Warrant Officer and Enlisted (Upper) Personnel|The GDSF, MSDF, and ASDF have assigned Warrant Officers and senior enlisted personnel new roles, which include giving instruction on service discipline to enlisted personnel. For example, the MSDF introduced the Command Master Chief System in April 2003, while the GSDF and ASDF introduced the Master Sergeant Major System and Command Master System respectively on a trial bases last year and are examining those new systems.||

Remark: As for the reference to the measures taken before the transition to the Ministry of Defense, the former name, “the Defense Agency”, is used.

As of May 2007, discussions are progressing based on past surveys and studies, aiming toward a conclusion by
this summer. Some of the feasible conclusions from this Panel are planned to be carried out.

**2. Efforts to Prevent Suicide among SDF Personnel**
Since 1998, the annual number of suicides in Japan has exceeded 30,000. This is a serious social problem, and
the number of SDF personnel committing suicide has also been increasing in recent years, setting a record-high
of 94 personnel in FY 2004, followed by a figure of 93 personnel for both FY 2005 and FY 2006.
The suicide of an SDF personnel is truly a great tragedy for both the personnel themselves and their
bereaved families, and it is also a great loss for the SDF to lose capable personnel. The Ministry of Defense
established, in July 2003, the Defense Agency Headquarters for the Prevention of Suicides (at the time),
headed by the Parliamentary Secretary for Defense (at the time), and took the following measures to prevent
suicide. Much effort will continue to be made to prevent suicide.


-----

(1) Expanding the counseling system (inside counselors, outside counselors, and 24-hour telephone hotline for
counseling)
(2) Promoting education, to ensure that commanders sense signs of mental problems among the subordinates,
and that general personnel are aware of their mental health
(3) Instituting a campaign period for mental health in spring and summer, which is when personnel are
transferred, to enhance awareness of mental health, which includes: having commanders closely monitor
the mental condition of subordinates who undergo a change in environment due to personnel transfer;
distributing various reference materials; and providing lectures.

**3. Commemorating Personnel Killed in the Line of Duty**
Since the establishment of the National Police Reserve in 1950, which has evolved through the National Safety
Force and the Coastal Safety Force into the SDF today, SDF personnel have been striving to accomplish the
noble mission of protecting the peace and independence of Japan. They have accomplished this by dealing with
various changes surrounding Japan, and devoting themselves unstintingly to training day and night to fulfill the
expectations and trust of the Japanese citizens, regardless of danger and with a strong sense of responsibility.
During this time, however, more than 1700 personnel have been killed in the line of duty.
In the Ministry of Defense and the SDF, funeral ceremonies are carried out by each SDF unit, to which the
personnel killed in the line of duty belonged, in order to express condolences to them. Moreover, in order to
eternally recognize the achievements of the SDF personnel killed in the line of duty, and to express deep honor
and condolences, memorial ceremonies are carried out in various forms, and support is provided to the families
of the deceased.
The Ministry of Defense and the SDF carry out an annual memorial ceremony for SDF personnel killed in
the line of duty, in the Memorial Zone[18], on the premises of the Headquarters of the Ministry of Defense, on the
SDF Commemoration Day, or other nearby days. This ceremony is joined by the bereaved families of the
personnel, the Prime Minister, high-ranking officials of the Ministry of Defense and the SDF, including the
Minister of Defense and past Minister of State for Defense. At the ceremony, the Prime Minister, the Minister
of Defense, and others give memorial addresses; the Guard of Honor carries out a funeral gun salute; and all
participants bow in honor of the deceased. Plates, on which names of the deceased are inscribed, are placed
inside the memorial stone located in the Memorial Zone.
When key figures, such as a minister of defense
from overseas, pay a courtesy call to the Ministry of
Defense, they offer a floral tribute and express respect
and condolences to the martyrs to duty. There have
been 50 visitors[19] from about 25 countries to the
present. Ministry of Defense officials, such as the
Minister of Defense, also express respect and
condolences on leaving and taking up the post.
In addition, memorial ceremonies of the same kind
are carried out in each garrison and base of the SDF.

**COMMENTARY**

**Opening of a Ministry of Defense Day Care Center (Mishuku Garrison)**

As part of its efforts to help SDF personnel with
child-rearing[1], the Ministry of Defense opened a day
care center for children on the premises of the
Mishuku Garrison (City of Setagaya, Tokyo) in
April this year as a model facility to meet the needs
specific to the SDF.
The day care center is on the first floor of a fourstory barrack, which has been refurbished. It consists
of a nursery room, post-illness nursery room,
kitchen, and medical treatment room, and offers
services for preschool children aged up to five. “Kids’ Garden Mishuku,” the day care center opened in the Mishuku Garrison

in April this year

The day care center is designed to meet the
needs specific to the SDF, where working hours tend to be irregular[2]. It features long-hour services from
early morning to night, as well as night-time and holiday services. Many SDF personnel with children are
pleased, saying, “It’s very helpful because its around-the-clock service fits every working situation such as
night shifts and disaster relief missions.”
The Ministry of Defense will further enhance the quality of the service to make the center even more
convenient for SDF personnel, while considering the establishment of facilities of the same kind, based on
demands from personnel, in other garrisons and bases.

1) The Ministry of Defense formulated the Action Plan of the Defense Agency as Specific Proprietor in March 2005 in accordance with the Action Plan
Development Guidelines (announced in August 2003) provided under the Law for Measures to Support the Development of the Next Generation (enforced
in July 2003). In the Action Plan, the importance of providing facilities to support the balance of working and family life of the SDF personnel is cited, and
the establishment of day care centers on the SDF premises is defined as one of the most urgent matters.
2) Due to around-the-clock duties, shift-based work, emergency calls, long-time exercises, trainings, disaster relief missions, and other irregular assignments

**Q&A**

**How is mental health care provided to personnel of the Ministry of Defense/**
**the Self-Defense Forces?**


The Ministry of Defense/the Self-Defense Forces
consider mental health care of their personnel
extremely important to enable them to maintain their
commitment to missions and perform their lofty
assignment of defending Japan, and is currently
implementing various plans.
As a result of hearings from SDF units conducted
between March and May 2000, it was pointed out that
a consultation service that can be used easily by SDF
personnel and other services should be provided, and
the Study Group Regarding Metal Health Care for SDF


MSDF personnel receiving mental health education. They are wearing
private clothes so that they do not mind ranks.


-----

Personnel made up mainly of external intellectuals was established in July the same year. After many
discussions, the Study Group compiled the Proposals for the Mental Health of SDF Personnel in October
the same year, and proposed such measures as the development of a system to control all mental health
activities, education on mental health care, and the strengthening of the counseling system. The Ministry
of Defense/the SDF have been taking various actions based on these proposals.
In addition, the Defense Agency Headquarters to Prevent Suicides (at the time) was established with
the Parliamentary Secretary for Defense (at the time) as the head in July 2003, and education on mental
health care, strengthening of the counseling system, and other measures have been promoted. As for the
counseling system, for example, many measures including the following have been taken:

❍ Allocation of inside counselors[1] in each garrison and other locations
❍ Invitation of outside counselors
❍ Opening of an around-the clock outside telephone counseling service

1) Inside counselors
GSDF: ❍ One for each company and other forces, two for each garrison (GSDF personnel who has completed various counseling trainings)

❍ One mental health officer (Major) for each Army Headquarters
MSDF: ❍ One for each unit and vessel (MSDF personnel who has completed various counseling trainings)

❍ Counseling at the Personnel Consultation Room provided in each headquarters.
ASDF: ❍ Counseling by Chief Warrant Officer (ASDF personnel who has completed various counseling trainings)

❍ The Mental Health Care Officer Seminars are held at the Mental Health Department of the SDF Gifu Hospital to nurture counselors. Two
personnel from those who have completed the seminars are assigned to each base as counselors.

**4. Retirement and Outplacement of Personnel, and Related Issues**

**1. Retirement and Outplacement of Personnel**
There is an early retirement system and a short-term service system for SDF Regular Personnel, to keep the
forces strong. Unlike general civilian government employees, many SDF Regular Personnel retire by their mid50s (personnel serving under the early retirement system) and their 20s (most uniformed personnel serving
under the short-term service system).
To resolve concerns that SDF Regular Personnel may have about their future, it is essential to ensure they
can live a steady retirement, and thus can work diligently with peace of mind while in service. Such treatment
also boosts morale and makes it easier to attract high-quality human resources.
For these reasons, the Ministry of Defense places great importance on outplacement measures for retiring
SDF Regular Personnel in personnel matters, and assists outplacement such as by providing occupational
training to teach useful skills, and by effectively using employment information.
Specific measures include: provision of education and training to acquire useful knowledge and skills for
outplacement; promotion of employment of retiring SDF Regular Personnel in the public sector; networking of
employment information at each SDF; and improvement of job-seekers’ skills by enhancing the job training
curricula.
Various local organizations help retiring SDF personnel find new jobs. On the other hand, since the
Ministry of Defense is not authorized to conduct employment placement services itself, the SDF Assistance
Foundation, with the permission of the Minister of Health, Labour and Welfare, and the Minister of Land,
Infrastructure and Transport, offers free employment placement services. As the job market is expected to
remain tight, assistance from local governments and other organizations is also becoming increasingly
necessary.
Retired Regular Personnel of the SDF work in various sectors, including the manufacturing and service
industries, and are now increasingly being employed as risk management staff, including disaster prevention,


-----

by local public organizations. Retired SDF personnel are highly evaluated by their employers because they
generally have an excellent sense of responsibility, diligence, physical strength, spirit, discipline, and other
qualities. In particular, those retired on reaching mandatory retirement age have great leadership skills
cultivated through many years of service. (See Fig. III-4-1-11)

**Fig. III-4-1-11 Main Measures for Reemployment Support**

|Category|Description|
|---|---|
|Occupational aptitude testing|Testing aimed to provide guidance on the basis of individual aptitudes|
|Technical training|Provide transferable technical skills for use after retirement (e.g. heavy-duty/special- purpose vehicle operation, information processing skills, crane operation, vehicle maintenance, boiler operation, handling dangerous materials)|
|Driver training|Grant heavy-duty vehicle license|
|Disaster prevention and risk control training|Provide Technical knowledge on disaster prevention administration and the Civil Protection Plan|
|Correspondence courses|Provide capabilities to obtain official certification (e.g. social insurance officer, health manager, real estate business manager) to SDF Regular Personnel that will take mandatory retirement|
|Business management training|Enlighten SDF Regular Personnel that will take mandatory retirement so that they foster social adaptability. Also provide know-how to lead a stable life after retirement or reemployment|
|Career guidance|Prepare near-retiree SDF Regular Personnel to find new employment and provide them with know-how to choose new occupation|



**2. Regulations on Outplacement of Personnel after Retirement**
There are restrictions on the outplacement of SDF Regular Personnel to prevent impropriety. For example,
within the first two years after a person leaves the SDF, if the prospective employer is a private company that
had a contract with the organization where the person worked within five years before leaving the SDF, then
the approval of the Minister of Defense or other regulated personnel is required[20]. In 2006, the Minister of
Defense approved 78 individual cases (78 persons) of reemployment of SDF Regular Personnel at private
companies.

**3. Reappointment System**
The reappointment system allows the re-employment of personnel who have the desire and capabilities to
continue working as SDF personnel when they reach the retirement age. The system makes the best possible
use of experienced and valuable human resources, and secures the linkage between employment and pension.
Under this system, the Ministry of Defense and the SDF have reappointed 221 personnel as of the end of May
2007. (See Fig. III-4-1-12)


-----

**Fig. III-4-1-12 Overview of Reappointment System**

|Item|Administrative Officials, and others|SDF Regular Personnel|
|---|---|---|
|Basic approach|Present mandatory retirement age to remain in place; personnel in their early 60’s who have the ability and motivation to work in the public service to be reappointed|While maintaining present mandatory retirement age, personnel with the motivation and ability to work as a SDF Regular Personnel beyond the mandatory retirement age remains to be appointed to a position determined by the Minister of Defense.|
|Job conditions|Full-time Shorter-time service|Full-time|
|Period of reappointment|One year, with renewal allowed|One year, with renewal allowed Extension is allowed for a certain period of time (between six months to a year) in the case of mobilization.|
|Maximum age for reappointment|65 (Maximum age was 61 between fiscal 2001 to fiscal 2003. After this, the age is being increased incrementally by one year, every three years)||
|Salary and allowance|Fixed monthly salary is provided based on job level and rank. Allowances, such as a commuting allowance, are provided.||

**COMMENTARY**

**The Prime Minister Attends the Memorial Service for SDF Personnel**
**who Lost Their Lives on the Duty**

A helicopter belonging to the 101st Squadron of the
Ground Self-Defense Force 1st Combined Brigade,
which was heading from Naha to Tokunoshima
Island on a disaster relief mission upon request from
the governor of Kagoshima Prefecture to transport
an urgent patient, crashed on March 30 this year.
This accident claimed precious lives of four SDF
members.
Prime Minister Abe attended the memorial
service for these members held in the Air SelfDefense Force Naha Base on April 15. He prayed Prime Minister Abe expressing his condolence for the SDF personnel who

lost their lives while on duty at the memorial service held in the ASDF Naha

for their souls, paying respect to their dedication in Base (Okinawa Prefecture)
his heartfelt words, “As the supreme commander of the SDF, I am utterly aggrieved at having lost these
four men, who demonstrated the pride and the responsibility of SDF members through their firmly-held
sense of mission to save patients at night despite harsh weather conditions. It is the responsibility of each
of us to respect their noble sacrifice and inherit their will to protect our people and land.”
Disaster relief missions are performed in an urgent situation where there is a need to maintain public
order and to protect life and property, and when no one but the SDF can handle the situation. The missions
often have to be performed in dangerous and harsh conditions or places. The SDF will continue to fulfill
its missions to protect what they must protect under even the most dangerous conditions.


-----

**5. Enhancing Information and Communications Capabilities**
Information and communication in the Ministry of Defense and the SDF are the basis for command and
control, extending from the central command, to the headquarters of GSDF, MSDF, and ASDF, and to the
lower units. It is like the central nervous system of the Ministry of Defense and the SDF. Therefore, the
Ministry of Defense and the SDF recognize the importance of enhancing information and communication
capabilities in related fields that are directly related to the capabilities of the SDF to execute missions.

**1. Response to the Information Technology (IT) Revolution**
In response to the IT revolution in recent years, the Ministry of Defense and the SDF are pursuing information
superiority[21], and are systematically establishing the infrastructure to integrate their defense capabilities in order
to enable efficient operations. The following three core measures have been taken: a) Developing sophisticated
networks, including the Defense Information Infrastructure (DII) or Common Operating Environment (COE),
b) Enhancing information and communications functions, such as the Central Command System (CCS) and the
command system of the GSDF, MSDF, and ASDF[22], and c) Assuring information security, such as protection
of the Ministry of Defense and the SDF systems against cyber attacks[23].

**2. Future Policy for Information and Communications (Action Plan)**
Going forward, the Ministry of Defense and the SDF must meet the new roles expected of the SDF, such as
promoting joint operations and ensuring that international peace cooperation activities are carried out smoothly.
Therefore, various mobile information and communications systems using the existing information and
communications infrastructure must be developed. To this end, policy targets for strengthening command and
communications capabilities and related capabilities have already been set[24]. The Ministry of Defense and the

SDF are now developing sophisticated information and communication systems in line with superior
technological advances both inside and outside Japan.
As a result, DII has become the standardized network for all SDF services, with the majority of information
systems of the Ministry of Defense being linked (approximately 130 information systems). By the end of fiscal
2006, the COE has been developed and a common environment has been established for all command systems.
Procedures for complying with the information system are now underway, and a common environment with
information systems used in support operations, such as supply and accounting, is being constructed.
In fiscal 2007, in addition to enhancing DII and COE, new measures will be taken. These will include
establishing a new organization—the SDF Command and Communication Squadron (tentative name)—and
strengthening analysis and countermeasures against cyber attacks through simulations. (See Fig. III-4-1-13)
(See Part II, Chapter 2, Section 4)

**6. Efforts for Efficient Acquisition of Defense Equipment**
Efficient acquisition of equipment and material is one of the most important elements for our defense. It is also
imperative to maintain production and technological bases for defense equipment within Japan even in
peacetime.
To achieve these goals, the Ministry of Defense has been promoting multidimensional reforms aimed at
bringing about more efficient and effective acquisition of defense equipment and materials, while enhancing
R&D activities including those at the Technical Research & Development Institute (TRDI). Details of these
efforts are as follows.

**1. Promotion of Acquisition Transformation—the Reform Process and Outline of Various Efforts—**
The Ministry of Defense has been promoting acquisition transformation. The major goals are; more efficient
and streamlined procurement, supply, and life-cycle management of defense equipment and materials;
enhancement of open and transparent procurement processes; as well as preservation and upgrading of the
necessary defense production and technological bases.
Major defense equipment is used over a period of 10 to 20 years after procurement. Furthermore, advanced
capabilities and reduced acquisition quantities have pushed up acquisition costs of current equipment. Under
these conditions, acquisition transformation towards more efficient and streamlined management of equipment
—from concept-refining, development, procurement, operation (incl. maintenance and repairs), to disposal—is
of increasing importance.
The ministry’s Equipment Procurement Office was established in July 2006 to provide efficient acquisition
of equipment. Enhanced life-cycle management of equipment through advanced life cycle cost information
management is being introduced to the MOD.
The Ministry of Defense is pursuing a variety of efforts for efficient procurement of equipment and
material. These include bulk purchase of equipment in a single fiscal year rather than over multiple fiscal years;
bulk purchase of equipment and material instead of separate purchases by the three SDF services;
commoditization of some specifications at the development stage; introduction of commercial off-the-shelf
products; private consignment; and review of the ways of maintenance of equipment.[25] Moreover, a review is
under way to improve cost accounting of equipment and materials, while improvement of the efficiency of the
procurement of stock components are in progress.
While the Japanese government is making efforts to assure appropriate public purchase in all fields, the
Ministry of Defense has also been reviewing private contract procedures to enhance the transparency and
fairness of the procurement process. Private contract procedures are being reformed by expanding the scope of
the comprehensive evaluation bidding system, increasing the number of contracts for bulk purchase of


-----

equipment over multiple fiscal years, and introducing efficient bidding procedures. A vice-chief in charge of
auditing has been appointed at the Equipment Procurement Office, while a councilor in charge of auditing and
an Audit Division have been set up in the Internal Bureau in the Ministry of Defense.
Moreover, from the view of preventing information leakages from contractors, a new special contract
clause has been added that imposes penalties for failing to protect classified information on protection of
classified information; and the scope of the special contract on information security has been expanded to cover
all contracts.

**2. Enhancement and Strengthening of the Defense Industry & Technological Bases**
The defense industry is an important sector for national security. Therefore, in order to “acquire high-quality
equipment in a shorter time at a lower cost,” it is essential to (even in peacetime) secure, defense production
and technological bases that are capable of designing, manufacturing, and maintaining equipment and
materials. Only a few companies have the capacity to develop and produce equipment because the production
quantities are small, while large initial investment and highly advanced technologies are required. This is
especially so in the case of major equipment, such as aircraft, warships, tanks, guided missiles, and related
items. As a result, the withdrawal of a company involved in manufacturing of equipment or material from the
market can immediately lead to an obstacle to the stable acquisition or maintenance of equipment and
materials. Moreover, it is critical to maintain this manufacturing base, in case that equipment is to be procured
from a foreign country, in order to maintain bargaining power with counterpart in the country and acquire the
equipment at the best condition.
On acquisition of equipment and materials, appropriate methods (e.g. domestic development, domestic
production based on license or import) have been decided after deliberate consideration on the costs and
availabilities of maintenance, supply, and education/training, and the potential necessity of making
improvements in the future, in addition to the performance and procurement cost. Taking the present severe
financial situation and the increasing price of equipment and materials into consideration, it is difficult to
expect large increase in acquisition quantity in the coming years. Therefore, it becomes all the more important
to make renewed effects so that defense production and technological bases with high productivity, high
technological capability and sound financial conditions, are maintained and fostered.
On the other hand, in the private sector, Japan possesses the high-tech capabilities to realize cutting-edge
performance and the production capabilities to manufacture highly reliable products as well. By appropriately
combining such technologies with existing defense technologies, and utilizing dual-use technologies, it is
possible to establish technologies for high-quality equipment. In addition, expanding the ‘spin off’ of defense
technologies to the private sector may contribute to the maintenance and promotion of defense production and
technological bases.
Amid such an environment, to “establish truly necessary defense production and technological bases,” the
Ministry of Defense is focusing attention on the defense production and technological bases that should be
maintained and promoted. (See Reference 60)

**7. Enhancement of Technical Research & Development**

**1. Research & Development of the Technical Research & Development Institute (TRDI)**
In the Ministry of Defense, it is required to select and concentrate research programs (e.g. by sharing works
with the private sector, focusing on fields of our country’s superiority) due to strict financial situations. TRDI
implemented a medium-to-long-term technology outlook which determined the vision on priority technology
areas and clarified future directions for each technology area[26]. In the outlook, focus was placed on advanced


-----

France

The first prototype of the next air carrier (C-X) (above) and the next fixed-wing
patrol aircraft (P-X) (below)

technologies that may produce equipment superior in the future battle space, not depending on the
prepossession evoked by the conventional equipment and materials system. Examples of priority areas are
improvement in detection and precision interception capabilities against new threats such as cruise missiles;
improvement in autonomy and networking of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and robots; improvement in
the protection capability of soldier equipment and NBC detection capabilities; and improvement in stealth
treatment and mobility of aircraft, ships, etc. In addition, for the response to various situations and joint
operations, it becomes necessary to introduce up-to-date technologies into R&D, and conduct deeper analysis
on operational needs. For these purposes, a number of new R&D methods are being adopted[27].
In order to optimize the performance, schedule, and cost throughout the life-cycle of equipment or
materials, it is effective to thoroughly conduct trade-off analysis on a number of proposals regarding
performance and cost at the point of concept creation or R&D. Additionally, it is effective to follow-up for
improvements and other necessary measures, after deployment of equipment and materials. Continuous study
is under way as part of efforts to enhance the R&D system. (See Figs. III-4-1-14 • 15)

**2. Strengthening Relations with the Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) Technology Field**
In regard to R&D at the Ministry of Defense, the National Defense Program Guideline and the Mid-Term
Defense Program state that efforts should be made “by proactively introducing advanced technology of
industrial, governmental and academic sectors.”
TRDI aims to investigate and introduce superior technologies in the private sector. As part of this effort,
from fiscal 2007, basic (element) technology research themes have been selected, and investigation & research
projects that invite public participation by not only private corporations, but also universities and independent
administrative institutions, have been newly introduced. Implementation of such projects are intended to push
forward introduction of superior technology from a wide range of organizations, including research
organizations such as universities and independent administrative institutions, without direct past contact with
the Ministry of Defense, and corporations not related to the defense industry.
Together with the use of COTS technology, it is also important to spread the outcome of R&D at the
Ministry of Defense into the private sectors. The Ministry of Defense is cooperating to promote the conversion
of aircraft that have been developed as SDF aircraft for civil use, since this may lead to a reduction in the
procurement costs of such aircraft. The Ministry of Defense is cooperating with other related ministries and
agencies through the Council of Ministries and Agencies Related to Promotion of Development of Civil
Aircrafts[28].

**8. Preventing Information Leaks**

**1. Protection of Classified Information**
Unauthorized leakage of some of the information handled by the Ministry of Defense could seriously damage
national security. Classified information must be kept secure for the sake of national defense and safety.
The Ministry of Defense defines three classifications and stipulates procedures for designation and
handling such as communication, storage, and disposal for each classification, in order to prevent unrelated
personnel from inappropriately accessing information. The three types of classified information are “Special
Defense Secret” which is information concerning materials, equipment, and other items provided by the United
States based on the Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement between Japan and the United States of America;
“Defense Secret” that is designated by the Minister of Defense as information concerning SDF operations,
defense capability development, and related issues that must be kept highly confidential for national defense;
and the so-called “Ministry of Defense Secret” that is classified information, other than those listed above,
related to the services of the Ministry of Defense.
Following an information leak via the Internet (in February 2006), the Ministry of Defense has taken
drastic measures to prevent a recurrence, as explained below in detail. Moreover, in view of cases of
information leaks at contractors, it is essential to ensure that private companies working for the Ministry of
Defense and the SDF handle information, particularly classified information, with the greatest care. The

Ministry of Defense will therefore add a clause to contractual documents stipulating fines as civil punishment
in the event of any leakage of secret information.

**2. Countermeasures for Information Leaks through the Internet**

**(1) A Case of Information Leakage and Its Background**
A series of information leaks via the Internet occurred at the Ministry of Defense and the SDF. In February
2006, a case of leakage of classified information on the MSDF destroyer Asayuki from a privately-owned PC
through file-sharing software came to light.


-----

The Ministry of Defense’s information security systems and the attitudes of personnel toward rapid IT
innovation lay behind this case. Specifically, as personal computers and portable memory devices have become
more powerful and mobile, it has become easy to save, copy, and carry enormous quantities of information.
Personal computers are now commonly used to give presentations, and can even handle music and video.
Although PCs were quickly introduced in a planned manner by central organizations such as the Internal
Bureau from around 1997, local organizations have been slower due to the number of staff (approximately
270,000), units and organizations scattered across the nation, and the fact that most units operate in the field or
on board vessels. As a result, many privately-owned PCs and portable memory devices were brought in and
used in the workplace. Consequently, both work-related and personal data (e.g. music) coexisted on private
PCs and portable memory devices, and personnel inadvertently took work-related data home with them on their
PCs and memory devices. This has caused information to be leaked onto the Internet by file-sharing software.

**(2) Preventing Recurrence**
**1) Emergency Measures**
In reaction to the information leak in February 2006, the Ministry of Defense issued the following emergency
instructions.
(a) File-sharing software installed in privately-owned PCs used for work must be immediately deleted.
(b) Among the work-related data saved on privately-owned PCs and memory devices, classified information
and unnecessary data must be immediately deleted.
(c) Handling of classified information by privately-owned PCs and other memory devices, which had been
allowed with official permission in the past, is totally prohibited.

**2) Drastic Measures to Prevent Recurrence**
In addition to these emergency measures, the Commission on Drastic Measures to Prevent Recurrence of
Computer Related Classified Information Leakages, headed by the Parliamentary Secretary for Defense (at the
time), was established in February 2006. The Commission discussed specific ways to prevent recurrence and
published its findings on April 12, 2006.
From April 2006, the Committee to Implement Measures for the Prevention of the Recurrence of Computer
Related Classified Information Leakages, headed by the Parliamentary Secretary of Defense and attended by
the heads of all institutions within the Ministry of Defense, has held meetings to implement specific measures.
The specific measures now being taken are listed below.
(a) Specific measures for information security
a. Technology and hardware measures (e.g. introduction of new technology)
❍ Immediate procurement by the government of approximately 56,000 PCs, and total removal of privatelyowned PCs from the workplace by November 2006.

❍ Implementation of measures to prevent leaks of work-related data from portable memory devices, such as by
introducing software that automatically encrypts data when saving it to such devices.
b. Review of the system
❍ Total ban on privately-owned PCs in the workplace, and introduction of government-supplied PCs.
❍ Total ban on privately-owned portable memory devices from April 2006. Concentrated control of
government-supplied portable memory devices.

❍ Preparation of a Ministry-wide response manual to cope with information leaks on the Internet.
❍ Investigation on the state of compliance with the information security system, including spot-checks.


-----

c. Leveling up education
❍ Provision of periodic education programs on the information security system and system for protecting
classified information. The education programs are tailored according to needs, such as the ranks of
personnel and types of information they handle.

❍ Establishment of contact desks in each organization to answer questions and provide advice on information
security (Help Desk) quickly and directly to personnel, and generate greater awareness of information
security.
(b) Drastic measures for protecting classified information
a. Strengthening the deterrent effect
❍ To change the classification of classified documents from “Ministry of Defense Secret (Top
Secret/Secret/Confidential)” for which punishment is relatively light, to “Defense Secret” for which
punishment is heavier, based on a close examination of the content of such documents. This was completed
in April 2007 to strengthen the deterrent effect.

❍ To prevent excessive designation of classified information through a strict process of designation, and to
reduce the number of unnecessary classified documents by declassifying those which no longer need to be
treated as secret.

❍ To obligate all personnel handling classified information to submit a written oath to make them aware of
their serious duty to protect classified information.
b. Strengthening the inspection system
To carry out spot examinations (e.g. body searches on entering and leaving off-limit zones; inspections of data
kept on computers which are not allowed to handle classified information, and spot inspections of contractors
which handle classified information), in order to prevent problems, such as taking out classified information or
inappropriately saving such information on portable memory devices or other tools.
(c) Drastic measures from the standpoint of disciplinary action
The deterrent effect, awareness and responsibility toward information security have been upgraded by
clarifying the punishment standard. The standard has been clarified by giving examples of violations that can
occur relevant to information leaks in this Internet society and notifying personnel that violators will be strictly
punished, including the person responsible for controlling information.

**3) Further Measures**
While these measures were still being carried out, an information leakage occurred at a Naha ASDF base in
November 2006. The Ministry of Defense therefore prepared and issued the following additional
countermeasures at a meeting of the Committee to Implement Measures for the Prevention of Recurrence of
Computer Related Classified Information Leakage on January 19, 2007.
(a) Thorough implementation of drastic measures
a. Preparation and distribution to individual personnel of a pamphlet citing case examples of the risks of
information leakage. The level of personnel’s understanding is checked.
b. February every year has been designated as “Information Security Month of the Ministry of Defense,” and
awareness activities and other events are carried out.
(b) Measures against non-compliance by personnel
a. Strengthening of inspections to prevent privately-owned portable memory devices and other tools being
brought into the workplace.
b. Making sure that privately-owned PCs at home do not contain work-related data, with permission from the
owner. Measures are again taken to confirm that work-related data is not saved in privately-owned PCs, etc.
Personnel are encouraged to delete file-sharing software by providing education on the threat of information
leakage caused by such software.


-----

(c) Strengthening the control system for preventing information leakage
a. Personnel who support the administrator shall be assigned carefully: they shall have a good knowledge of
computers and related matters.
b. Education and inspection shall be strengthened when personnel are under special working conditions outside
of the reach of the administrator.

**3. Occurrence of Case Regarding the MSDF Destroyer Shirane and Responses**
In March 2007, it was found that a crew member of the MSDF Destroyer Shirane had saved information that
was thought to be classified on a privately-owned external hard disk drive at home.
As this case could constitute a violation of the law on the handling of classified information, the police
affairs unit of the MSDF is working with the Kanagawa prefectural police to clarify the details. An
Investigation Commission headed by the Vice Chief of Staff at the MSDF was established on April 4, 2007 to
carry out detailed investigations, including the timing at which the information was taken out.
Details, including the cause, will become apparent as the investigation proceeds, yet the case reveals a lack
of awareness of the importance of information handled by the SDF, and the risk of information leaks caused by
computerization. Efforts to raise awareness seem not to have reached rank-and-file staff. The possibility that
work-related data taken out before drastic measures were implemented may still exist on privately-owned PCs
at home and in other places is a real threat.
The Ministry of Defense takes such cases extremely seriously. For the Minister of Defense to head the
prevention of information leaks, the Committee to Implement Measures for the Prevention of the Recurrence of
Computer Related Classified Information Leakage was abolished on April 24, 2007 and the Council for
Prevention of Information Leakage was newly established. This Council is chaired by the Minister of Defense,
and consists of the heads of all organizations within the Ministry of Defense, such as the Administrative Vice
Minister, Director-General of the Secretariat, all the Director-Generals of Bureaus, GSDF Chief of Staff,
MSDF Chief of Staff, and ASDF Chief of Staff.
At the first meeting of the Council, some measures were decided to address the lack of awareness. These
measures include dispatching a special action team, consisting of high-ranking personnel and others belonging
to the Internal Bureau and other organizations, to local regions, to instill the importance of recurrence
prevention measures among local personnel; and conducting individual training for those involved in
preventing information leaks. These efforts will raise staff awareness of information security and related issues.
Through the Council, the Ministry of Defense will continue to do its utmost to prevent information leaks.

Section 2. Interaction between the Ministry of Defense & the SDF, and the Local
Community & Japanese Citizens

As noted at the beginning of this Chapter, the Ministry of Defense and the SDF cannot carry out their diverse
responsibilities without the understanding and cooperation of all Japanese citizens, local public organizations,
and other organizations.
Section 1 explained that cooperation by local public organizations and other organizations is essential in
assisting the recruitment and outplacement of SDF Regular Personnel. In other fields too, the SDF’s activities
are supported in various ways by local communities and Japanese citizens. Likewise, the SDF effectively uses
its organizational structure, equipment, and abilities to contribute to people’s livelihoods. Such activities not
only foster mutual reliance between the SDF and the local community and the wider public, but also strengthen
the foundation of defense while instilling in SDF personnel a sense of pride and confidence.
In addition, defense facilities[29] are an indispensable foundation of the nation’s defense capabilities and the
Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements. For these facilities to function optimally, harmonious relations with local
communities and the understanding of local residents are crucial, so that the facilities can be kept ready at all
times. The Ministry of Defense and the SDF do their best to minimize the effects of the presence and operation
of defense facilities on the daily lives of local residents through various measures.
This section explains how the Ministry of Defense and the SDF relate with local communities and people
on a daily basis, and activities and measures undertaken to gain public understanding and cooperation.

**1. Cooperation from Local Public Organizations and Other Related Organizations with the**
**SDF**

**1. Cooperation in Recruitment of SDF Regular Personnel and Support for Outplacement**
As explained in the previous section, amid the severe recruitment environment and tight job market,
cooperation from local public organizations and related organizations is necessary to secure highly qualified
personnel and to assist the outplacement of SDF Regular Personnel who retire at a relatively young age.
(See Chapter 4, Section 1)

**2. Support of SDF Activities**
SDF garrisons and bases are located in all prefectures of Japan and are closely linked with the local host
communities. Therefore, various forms of cooperation and the support of local communities are indispensable
for the SDF to conduct diverse activities, including the
management of garrisons and bases, education and
training, disaster relief dispatch and actions necessary
for the nation’s defense.
The activities of the SDF are strongly supported by
the people of Japan, including local residents and
various organizations near SDF garrisons and bases.
In addition to such support from local
communities, many people send letters of
encouragement to SDF personnel engaged in
international peace cooperation activities and other
missions, thus raising the morale of SDF personnel
and strengthening their awareness of serving the MSDF personnel supports the yacht race in the National Sports Festival
people of Japan.

**[COLUMN]**

**VOICE**

**Voice of an Administrative Official Working as an Interpreter and Coordinator**

**Ikuo Yoshida**
**Defense Policy Division, Bureau of Defense Policy,**
**Internal Bureau of the Ministry of Defense**

I am working mainly as an interpreter and
coordinator at the Defense Policy Division, Internal
Bureau of the Ministry of Defense for activities with
the United States. I entered the Ministry of Defense
in April 2002, and after working at the Air Staff
Office, was assigned to the current post in August
2006.
My duties include coordination with the U.S.
embassy in Tokyo, as well as prior arrangement and
interpretation for meetings with the U.S. Forces in
Japan (USFJ) and visits by foreign officers to the Administrative Official Yoshida (left behind) working as an interpreter at a
staff of the Ministry of Defense. meeting with Guam U.S. Army officers
I always realize the need to study harder whenever I work as an interpreter. Interpretation requires not
only language skills but also a variety of knowledge and information. In addition to everyday English
conversation skills, interpreters need to have deep knowledge particularly with regard to defense, and I
come across English that I have never been taught at school every time I work as an interpreter. When I
had just entered the ministry, I did not know technical terms very well, and even “SAM,” “CAP” and “dog
fight” only sounded to me like “Sam” (a man’s name), “baseball cap,” and “dog fight” (literally). My
current duty involves attending various meetings, and I am struggling with countless defense
abbreviations and the unique ways of speaking of Japanese and American people, while hoping to
gradually improve my interpretation skills.
The coordination work involves discussing plans for receiving visitors and closely collaborating with
the U.S. side. I am sometimes confronted with differences in the way of thinking and culture, but when
visits end successfully and visitors return home satisfied, I really feel rewarded. I often need to use
English while at work, and am very pleased that I am working in an ideal environment for further refining
my language skills.
I had been a university student until only six years ago, and had had no knowledge about the Ministry
of Defense or the Self-Defense Forces, nor any interest in defense issues. I had taken peace of Japan as
granted, believing that peace is something naturally given, and that Japan is a naturally peaceful country
and does not have to do anything to maintain the peace. However, as I became an interpreter after entering
the Ministry of Defense and began to attend meetings where Japan and foreign countries exchange
opinions regarding defense, I have realized that, behind the peace we take for granted, there are dedicated
people who are making tremendous unseen efforts to protect the peace of Japan.
I think that there are now many Japanese who have experiences of living abroad and are good at
language. I hope that those who are interested in entering the Ministry of Defense will fully utilize their
experiences and language skills built up abroad for the ministry and the SDF where international
exchanges are becoming increasingly important.

**2. Activities in Civic Life and Contributions to Society**
The SDF’s role is much more than the defense of the country as defined in the National Defense Program
Guidelines. The SDF also carries out activities in various fields based on requests from local public
organizations, relevant organizations, and other bodies to support people’s livelihood. Such activities foster
mutual reliance between the SDF and the public, and help reinforce the defense infrastructure. These activities
also give SDF personnel a sense of pride and confidence in their constant contribution to the livelihood of the
people. (See Figs. III-4-2-1 • 2)

|Col1|Fig. III-4-2-1 Activities in Civic Life|
|---|---|
|Items|Details of Activities and Their Past Records|
|Disposal of Unexploded Bombs1|The GSDF disposes of such bombs at the request of municipal governments and others. Disposal operations in last fiscal year: a total of 2,403 disposal operations (average 46 operations per week), weighing about 74.5 tons; in particular, the amount of unexploded bombs that were disposed of in Okinawa Prefecture totaled about 30.9 tons, accounting for 41.3% of such bombs removed across the nation)|
|Removal of Mines2|The MSDF undertakes minesweeping operations in waters designated as dangerous areas because underwater mines had been laid there during World War II. Minesweeping has been almost completed in the dangerous areas. At present, the MSDF has been removing or disposing of explosives at the request of municipal governments. Disposal operations in last fiscal year: a total of 94,462 units were disposed of, including 7 underwater mines (average about 1,816 units per week), weighing about 20.0 tons. (If unexploded bombs are chemical bombs, their disposal is basically beyond disposal ability of the SDF. But the SDF is prepared to extend as much cooperation as possible for disposal of such bombs by identifying them and checking if fuses are attached.)|
|Medical Activities3|Medical services are provided to general citizens at National Defense Medical College in Tokorozawa, Saitama Prefecture, and part of hospitals affiliated with the SDF (five out of 16 such hospitals, including SDF Central Hospital in Setagaya Ward, Tokyo). National Defense Medical College runs a emergency medical center, which is in charge of providing emergency medical service to seriously injured patients and patients in a critical condition. The center is designated as a medical facility providing tertiary emergency service. In the wake of a disaster, medical units belonging to major SDF units, acting on a request from municipal governments, provide emergency medical service and work for the prevention of epidemics. GSDF Medical School (Setagaya Ward, Tokyo), MSDF Underwater Medical Center (Yokosuka City, Kanagawa Prefecture) and ASDF Aviation Medicine Laboratory (Tachikawa City, Tokyo and Sayama City, Saitama Prefecture) undertake study on outdoor sanitation, underwater medicine and aviation medicine, respectively. National Defense Medical College Research Institute (Tokorozawa City, Saitama Prefecture) undertakes study on emergency medicine.|
|Cooperation for Supporting Athletic Meetings4|In response to support requests from concerned organizations, the SDF helps operations of athletic competitions such as Olympic games and Asian games being held in Japan and national sports meetings in the fields of ceremonies, communications, transportation, music performance, medical service and emergency medical service. The SDF provides transportation and communication support to marathon events and ekiden road relays.|
|Exchanges with Local Communities|Sports facilities like grounds, gyms and swimming pools at many of SDF garrisons and bases are open to general citizens in response to requests from local communities. SDF personnel promote exchanges with people of local communities by participating in various events sponsored by general citizens and municipal governments or by acting as sports referee and instructors on an individual basis.|

|Offering of Education and Training on Consignment from Other Parties1|The SDF, acting on requests from third parties, provides education and training to people other than SDF personnel. Basic ranger training, underwater search and rescue training, education on how to respond to chemical disasters, and aircraft-maneuvering training are provided to police officers and personnel of the Japan Coast Guard. National Institute for Defense Studies and the graduate school of National Defense Academy offer education to employees at private-sector companies and personnel of other government ministries on a consignment basis.|
|Transportation Work2|Acting on requests from concerned government ministries and agencies, the SDF, using GSDF, MSDF and ASDF helicopters and government planes, transports state guests and the Prime Minister. Acting on requests from Ministries such as the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the SDF provides transportation support for events such as recovery of remains of dead Japanese soldiers, the Joint Japan-U.S. Commemorative Ceremony of the Battle of IWOTO, and pilgrimages to IWOTO in memory of the war dead. SDF units operate government planes which are used when the Emperor and other imperial members make overseas visits or the Prime Minister makes overseas trips to attend international conferences. (Partial revision in July 2005 of ordinances of the Self-Defense Forces Law has enabled the use of an SDF plane for transport of state ministers if doing so is deemed necessary for the execution of important duties.)|
|Ceremonial Work at National Events3|The SDF provides support for state-sponsored ceremonial events involving the Emperor, other imperial members and state guests, with its personnel serving as honor guard4, forming a line for guests5 and firing a gun salute for them6. Guard of honor and firing of gun salute are offered at welcoming ceremonies for state guests.|
|Cooperation in Antarctic Exploration7|The SDF has provided operational support for icebreakers being dispatched to the South Pole for Antarctic expedition since the seventh Antarctic expedition team was sent there in 1965, contributing greatly to Japan’s Antarctic exploration project that recently marked the 50th anniversary. Most recently, the SDF provided support to the 48th Antarctic expedition team, which was dispatched to the Antarctic Ocean from November last year to April this year, by helping icebreaker Shirase transport members of the expedition team and 1,100 tons of goods and supplies, and by assisting maritime observation, fixed-point observation and research observation being planned by the expedition team. (Icebreaker Shirase is set to retire from active service following the completion of voyages planned for this fiscal year because the ship is outmoded in its various parts with the passage of 24 years since its maiden voyage. Construction of Shirase’s successor ship began in fiscal 2005. It will be put on active service in fiscal 2009.|
|Other Cooperation|Acting on requests from the Japan Meteorological Agency, the SDF supports it in various meteorological observations, such as volcanic observation using aircraft and marine-ice observation in Hokkaido coastal regions. Acting on requests from a liaison council formulating anti-radiation measures, the SDF collects high-altitude floating dusts and makes radiation analysis of them. The SDF, also acting on requests from the Geographical Survey Institute, supports it in aerial measurement aimed at making maps. Entrusted by the state and municipal governments, the SDF undertakes civil engineering work. (Such support is provided only if doing so is deemed as serving training purposes)8 Other support activities by the SDF include sea ice observation, support of flights of private chartered aircraft, and transportation of music bands to IWOTO.|

Many defense facilities, including airfields and maneuver areas, require vast areas of land. Some defense
facilities compete with cities and industries in small plains due to the natural geography of Japan. Therefore,
problems of restricted presence and operations of defense facilities have occurred due to the urbanization of
areas around many defense facilities as a result of economic development. Another problem concerns

residential environments being affected by noise, and other factors arising from frequent takeoffs and landings
of aircraft, firing and bombing, artillery firing, tank operations, and other reasons.

**2. Resolving Defense Facility Issues, and Various Measures**
Defense facilities are indispensable infrastructure for the security of Japan to underpin Japan’s defense
capabilities and Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements, and it is necessary to assure such facilities are always
available. To achieve this, and to solve the problems previously listed, the Ministry of Defense has been
carrying out the measures presented in Fig. III-4-2-5 to ensure harmony between defense facilities and
surrounding communities, and to gain the support of local residents. (See Reference 63)

**Fig. III-4-2-5 Measures to Ensure Harmony between Defense Facilities and Surrounding Communities**

|Purpose|Measures|Description of Measures|
|---|---|---|
|Prevention of Noise Problems|Subsidies to Finance Sound Insulation Work|Educational facilities such as elementary schools, junior high schools and kindergartens, medical facilities like hospitals and clinics, and welfare facilities such as nursery centers, day- service centers for the elderly and special nursing homes for the elderly Housing|
||Compensation for Relocations|Compensation for relocating buildings Land procurement Improvement of public facilities such as roads, water-supply systems and sewage facilities in land where housing is to be relocated|
||Improvement of Green Zones|Tree planting, upgrading of grass fields|
|Prevention of Problems Other Than Noise|Subsidies to Finance Trouble- Prevention Work|River improvement projects, improvement of irrigation and drainage canals, dams, reservoirs, pumping stations, roads, sewage facilities and facilities for jointly receiving TV broadcasting services|
|Reduction of Troubles Related to Life and Business|Subsidies to Build Facilities Meant to Stabilize People’s Livelihood|Learning facilities Garbage and human-waste treatment plants, fire-fighting facilities, parks, roads, green zones, community halls, libraries, welfare centers for the elderly and nursing homes for the elderly Agricultural facilities Fishery facilities|
|Reduction of Effects on Surrounding Areas|Provision of Grant Aimed at Improving Areas Surrounded by Designated Defense Facilities|Improvement of public facilities like traffic facilities, recreation centers and welfare facilities|



One such measure is improving the living environment around airfields. The Ministry of Defense has long
put priority on such measures, including providing subsidies for sound insulation works for houses. However,
some residents have filed law suits concerning noise damage and other issues[31].
In 2001, therefore, the Ministry of Defense established the Council for the Improvement of the Living
Environment around Airfields, consisting of outside experts, to discuss future measures. In 2002, the Council
presented a report[32] asserting that a) in response to the Fair Compensation Movement, measures to help win
deeper understanding of the residents living near airfields, including those not filing noise-related lawsuits,


-----

should be taken; and b) in response to various requests
from local public organizations and residents, it is
essential to diversify measures to suit local
characteristics, and to develop measures focusing on
those local public organizations and residents that are
seriously affected by aircraft noise, within budget
constraints, instead of simply continuing conventional
measures.
The Ministry of Defense will appropriately review
measures, such as projects to improve living
environments, commencing with the subsidizing of
sound insulation work for houses, based on the

Construction to widen the Nagae river in Miyazaki prefecture (Ebino city) was

recommendations made in the report of the Council. carried out as part of efforts to ensure harmony with communities surrounding

defense facilities

After gaining understanding in the actual status of
noises in the surrounding area of defense facilities, and appropriately reexamining the target area for sound
insulation work for houses, by taking the actual conditions into consideration, the Ministry is also striving to
enhance new measures.
Moreover, to further streamline efficient measures for the environment around airfields, based on the socalled “Large-Boned Policy 2006” (decision at Cabinet Meeting on July 7, 2006), subsidy options and rates are
being readjusted. (See Figs. III-4-2-5 • 6 • 7 • 8)

**Fig. III-4-2-6 New Measures to Promote Harmony between Defense Facilities and Surrounding Communities**

|New Measures|Description of Projects|
|---|---|
|Initiative to Integrate Various Projects Undertaken in Areas Surrounded by Defense Facilities|Various livelihood-improvement projects being planned separately by municipalities in designated areas where serious problems are caused due to installation and operations of defense facilities will be integrated with certain discretion given to concerned municipalities for project implementation.|
|Subsidies to Installation of Solar-Power Systems|Monitoring will be conducted to study whether it is advisable to provide subsidies to households which have installed a solar power system as part of sound-insulation work so as to reduce their financial burden of paying electricity charges for air-conditioning equipment which has been also installed for sound insulation.|
|Promotion of Housing- Exterior Work for Sound Insulation|In order to improve livelihood of affected households, sound-insulation work covering the entire part of their houses will be promoted instead of room-based work as being applied previously.|
|Community-Building Support Projects|Subsidies and other support will be provided for an initiative by municipalities to promote community- building using surrounding assets (near airfields). Such support is meant to significantly contribute to the development of local communities as well as reducing negative effects of defense facilities to minimal levels.|
|Renovation of Existing Public Facilities|When public halls and other public facilities become unable to meet needs of local people because such facilities have become outmoded with the passage of time or the people got aged, these facilities will be renovated using subsidies so that they are made barrier-free with their safety being enhanced.|
|Active Use of Assets Near Airfields|The state will promote the use by the general public of surrounding assets it has established and managed, such as green zones, by installing benches and rest facilities and permitting municipalities to use them. The state will also permit municipalities to use farm areas so that they are open to citizens.|

**3. Environmental Conservation**
In maintaining facilities, including maneuver areas and quarters, and equipment, such as aircrafts, ships, and
vehicles, the SDF is implementing environmental conservation measures to reduce its environmental burden[33].
In 2001, Defense Agency Environment Month and Week were established. The Ministry of Defense has
been striving to raise environmental awareness among SDF personnel, and has been organizing events for the
prevention of global warming at military garrisons and bases throughout Japan. These include environmental
conservation promotion programs, an environment-related senryu (short humorous verse) contest, lectures,
exhibitions, and designating a “no-car day.” The Ministry of Defense, as a member of the government, has
been preparing implementation plans based on various central government plans, and has been taking a positive
approach toward the environment[34]. The Ministry will forge ahead with such initiatives and activities.

**4. Public Relations Activities, Information Disclosure, and Related Activities**

**1. Various Public Relations Activities**
As the SDF has expanded the scope of its activities at home and abroad, including international peace
cooperation activities and disaster relief dispatches, and with the growing concern over the security
environment in East Asia, including ballistic missile launches by North Korea, the public’s interest in national
defense has been increasing[35].
With general recognition that the Ministry of Defense and the SDF need to actively promote public
relations on defense policy and SDF activities, the Ministry of Defense and the SDF continually carry out
various PR activities. Unprecedented types of PR, such as “packaged PR” that combines several types of
campaigns over a certain period, have been carried out recently. With consideration for changing public
awareness and needs as well as increasing overseas interest in the Ministry of Defense and the SDF, constant
efforts are exerted for a better understanding toward the actual state of SDF through these various PR activities.

**(1) Website (http://www.mod.go.jp), Pamphlets, and others**
The Ministry of Defense and the SDF conduct PR activities using multimedia, including providing information
and gathering public opinions on the Internet, producing PR videos, and showing PR commercials of each SDF
service on large outdoor screens.
Especially, the website of the Ministry of Defense provides information on National Defense Program
Guidelines which are bases for Japan’s defense policy, the Mid-Term Defense Program, and the status of SDF
activities both in and outside Japan. The website also daily provides the latest information on the Ministry of
Defense and the SDF for all segments of the Japanese population, including details of press conferences by the
Minister of Defense, meetings between the high level officials of the Ministry of Defense and key figures of
other countries. As results of these approaches, monthly hits rose by 22%, from approximately 360,000 in
fiscal 2005 to approximately 440,000 in fiscal 2006. Moreover, in December 2006 a “Kids Page” for children
was started on the website of the Ministry of Defense, and in April 2007 a website specifically for mobile
phones (http://www.mod.go.jp/m/) with superior simplicity and immediacy for all segments of the Japanese
population as well as youngsters was started. Through these and other efforts, the Ministry of Defense is also
promoting innovative PR campaigns particularly designed for the young and younger generations.
The Ministry of Defense has been making efforts to provide accurate information on the SDF and national
defense to the public more extensively, including issues and distribution of various pamphlets explaining the
policies of the Ministry of Defense, activities of the SDF, etc., cooperation for media coverage, and assistance
in editing the new PR magazine, “MAMOR.[36]” Additionally, as the SDF has increased activities overseas,
interest in the Ministry of Defense and the SDF from overseas has been mounting. Efforts including the

furnishing of information to overseas are expended by publishing the quarterly English pamphlets Japan
Defense Focus, facilitating the participation of foreign media in regular press conferences, improving the
English website of the Ministry of Defense, and preparing an English version of the defense white paper,
English pamphlets and PR videos on policies, and so on.

**(2) Events, PR Facilities, etc.[37]**

The Ministry of Defense and the SDF conduct activities in informing the people of Japan about the current
state of the SDF broadly as follows: annually demonstrating the GSDF comprehensive fire power exercise,
held at the foot of Mt. Fuji; conducting sailing tours of MSDF destroyers at each location; and demonstrating
flying and conducting flight tours of aircraft at ASDF open base festivals. At stations and bases across Japan,
events including equipment exhibitions, unit tours and concerts by SDF bands are held on the anniversary of a
unit’s foundation, and so forth. In addition, a SDF Marching Festival, a troop review, a fleet review, an air
review, etc., are held as events of the SDF Commemoration Day.
The 2006 SDF Marching Festival was held at Nippon Budokan with the participation of a military band of
the Indian Army and other guest bands, attracting an audience of approximately 46,000 in total. Annual
reviews by the SDF, the troop review, fleet review and air review are hosted in rotation by the GSDF, MSDF
and ASDF, at which the SDF equipment and exercises are exhibited to the public. Last year, the MSDF held
the fleet review with about 52,500 people on board. This year, the GSDF will hold the troop review.
In addition to such events, the Ministry of Defense and the SDF actively give tours around PR facilities.
For example, at the Ministry of Defense, the head offices in Ichigaya are open to all visitors on two guided
tours each weekday, one in the morning and one in the afternoon. Since the tours started in June 2000, more
than 180,000 people have so far visited. Each SDF service also has PR facilities that can be visited free of
charge, and stations and bases nationwide have facilities for PR and historical materials open to the public.
(See Reference)

**(3) Enlistment Experience Programs[38]**

The SDF provides enlistment experience programs for employees at the request of private companies, etc. The
purpose is to gain experience of the SDF through living and training according to the same daily schedule as
SDF personnel by staying at a SDF station or base for two or three days. In fiscal 2006, about 1,500 programs
were provided, and about 25,700 people participated in the programs. Tours of enlistment experiences are also
provided for youngsters, college students and women[39].


-----

**2. Appropriate Operation of the Information Disclosure System[40]** **and Personal Data Protection**
**System[41]**

Along with the enforcement of the Act on Access to Information Held by Administrative Organs in 2001, the
Ministry of Defense developed an information disclosure system, and discloses administrative documents
under its jurisdiction when disclosure is requested, based on the Act. Moreover, in compliance with the
enforcement of the Law for the Protection of Personal Data Held by Administrative Organs in 2005, the
personal information protection system has been developed. The Ministry of Defense and the SDF secure
personal information owned by the organizations, and take measures, such as disclosing personal information
based on the Law, in response to requests for disclosure, correction, or suspension of information utilization.
To carry out these measures, the Ministry of Defense opened personal information disclosure/protection
counters at its Headquarters (Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo) and SDF Provincial Cooperation Offices throughout the
country to receive disclosure requests and other documents, and to disclose such information.
Moreover, the Defense Facilities Administration Agency has information counters at the Headquarters,
Defense Facilities Administration Bureaus, and Defense Facilities Administration Branches, and carries out the
same work. However, following the abolishment of the Defense Facilities Administration Agency, information
counters at the above SDF Provincial Cooperation Offices will be abolished. Instead of the conventional Defense
Facilities Administration Bureaus (Branches), information counters will be established in new Provincial
Defense Bureaus (Branches). The counters will carry out the same work, and the information disclosure system
and personal information protection system will be operated appropriately. (See Reference 62)

**3. Appropriate Operation of the Whistle-Blower Protection System[42]**

In recent years, various scandals in private corporations that have endangered security and people’s lives have
been revealed by the employees of the organization.
The Whistle-Blower Protection Act went into effect in April 2006 to urge corporations to comply with the
law on protecting human lives, health, and safety-related conditions; and to develop a safeguard system to
protect workers who disclose information that is of public interest from receiving unfair treatment, such as
dismissal.
In accordance with the Act, the Ministry of Defense set up a system to handle public interest-related
information disclosures by the MOD employees and outside workers on issues where the Ministry of Defense
has the legal right to punish or issue recommendations. Moreover, the Ministry of Defense and the SDF have
established an internal contact desk for information disclosure in the public interest by the MOD employees,
and an external contact desk for such disclosure by outside workers. Through the contact desks, the Ministry
deals with the disclosure of information that is of public interest and protection of whistle-blowers.

**4. Engagement in Policy Evaluation[43]**

A system to evaluate government policies was introduced in order to improve the efficiency and quality of
administration for the benefit of the people in 2001, while the Government Policy Evaluations Act (GPEA)
came into effect in 2002.
Based on these policies, the Ministry of Defense is evaluating various policies designated to achieve the
objectives of the Ministry of Defense and the SDF: to ensure the peace and independence of Japan, and the
security of the state. These evaluations involve analysis from various perspectives, such as domestic and
overseas circumstances and technological innovation trends, and a comprehensive evaluation system is used.
In fiscal 2006, a total of 43 policy evaluations were performed, including one for “multilateral security
dialogue.”

Section 3. Gaining the Trust of Japanese Citizens

Defense forces are the last resort to ensure the nation’s security and cannot be substituted by other means.
Nevertheless, defense forces that do not have the public’s backing cannot function effectively. SDF personnel
work hard on a daily basis to meet the people’s trust and expectations.
However, certain incidents have undermined public trust. The Ministry of Defense and the SDF deeply
regret such incidents and strive to prevent recurrence as explained below[44].

**1. Actions Taken Against Collusive Bidding, and Similar Cases by the Defense Facilities**
**Administration Agency**

**Report on Drastic Measures to Prevent Collusive Bidding, and Similar Cases by the Defense**
**Facilities Administration Agency**
On January 30, 2006, senior officials of the Defense Facilities Administration Agency and other persons were
arrested on charges of interfering with bidding for the construction of defense facilities. Following this
incident, to create a new system for the former Defense Agency as a policy-making government organization

that can be trusted by the people, the former Defense Agency established the Committee to Investigate the Case
of Collusive Bidding Procedures, and Similar Cases by the Defense Facilities Administration Agency headed
by the Director General of the Defense Facilities Administration Agency, Iwao Kitahara, and the Panel to
Examine Drastic Measures to Prevent Recurrence of Collusive Bidding, and Similar Cases by the Defense
Facilities Administration Agency headed by the then Senior Vice-Minister for Defense, Taro Kimura, under the
auspices of the then Minister of State for Defense Fukushiro Nukaga. Detailed investigations were conducted
prior to taking measures to prevent recurrence.
On June 15, 2006, the Committee prepared and published its report, “Investigation on the Case of Collusive
Bidding Procedures, and Similar Cases by the Defense Facilities Administration Agency.” The following day,
on June 16, 2006, the Panel published its report, “Report on Drastic Measures to Prevent Recurrence of
Collusive Bidding, and Similar Cases by the Defense Facilities Administration Agency[45].”
The Ministry of Defense is aware that, before carrying out such measures, it must change the attitudes of its
personnel. In particular, it is important to repeatedly announce that the budget is taxpayers’ precious money,
and to foster awareness of compliance among its personnel. All staff must maintain the proper attitude, verify
the effects of measures, make changes when a problem occurs, and act appropriately. (See Fig. III-4-3-1)

**2. Measures against Drug Abuse**
The Ministry of Defense and the SDF deeply regret the series of drug abuse cases in 2005[46], and established the
Committee on Measures for Drug Issues in October 2005. This Committee issued a final report[47] in February
2006, describing the problems, prevention measures, and other related issues.
Despite these efforts, there have been further cases of SDF Regular Personnel being arrested on allegations
of violating the Stimulants Control Law and the Law Concerning Special Provisions for the Narcotics and
Psychotropics Control Law, etc., and Other Matters for the Prevention of Activities Encouraging Illicit
Conducts and Other Activities Involving Controlled Substances through International Cooperation. One ASDF
Regular Personnel was arrested in April 2006; two MSDF Regular Personnel were arrested in September 2006;
and one GSDF Regular Personnel was arrested in February 2007. In response to the case in September 2006, at
a meeting of the Committee on Measures for Drug Issues in September, a more effective drug testing system[48]

was discussed, and it was decided that drug testing should be carried out on all personnel covering SDF
Regular Personnel working in ground, maritime, and air forces within a fixed term[49]. The Ministry of Defense
and the SDF will continue to take strict measures to prevent recurrence.

**VOICE**

**Voice of a Female SDF Member Working as a Base Security Guard**

**Staff Sergeant Tomoyo Matsumoto, ASDF**
**Security Guard Unit, Air Base Group, the 3rd Air Transport Unit**

Do you know what duties a base security guard
performs?
The duties include guarding a front gate and
other spots, patrolling the base, and coping with
contingencies inside and outside the base. In an
emergency, we even prevent an enemy’s attack or
invasion to protect the function of the base, which is
vulnerable part of the air force. Guarding of the base
is thus something that the Air Self-Defense Force is
actively reinforcing.
I am very pleased that, although I am a woman, I Staff Sergeant Matsumoto at work as a base security guard
have been assigned to that post and provided with an opportunity to work on the frontline of guarding of
the base. The job is challenging, and I enjoy working every day. In addition to protecting the base, I can
also work at the front gate as the “face” of the base, and am glad that many people recognize me and give
me a cheer when they pass the gate. I also feel happy—and blush—when my children say, “You are cool,
mum!”
I am currently responsible for general affairs in a security guard platoon, and performing such duties
as the improvement of the working environment so that everyone can work comfortably, the support for
administrative work of the platoon, as well as the implementation of base security guard training. I
sometimes join a team which works around the clock in shifts as security guards. When I worked in shifts
for the first time, I was very worried about my children because the work required me to stay in the base
for a full day without returning home. But since my husband and parents understand my work and give me
a helping hand, I can now work without any concern.
My motto is to be as reliable as male personnel and be as attentive to work as possible as a woman. I
was promoted to staff sergeant this January, and my responsibility became heavier accordingly. I am
currently studying very hard to become a squad leader and lead my own team as soon as possible.
However, my biggest concern is to build up physical strength. However hard I am working, it is
obvious that I am not as strong as men in fighting drills and other exercises. While I am doing my best to
overcome my disadvantages, I am also trying to find out what I can do in the area other than physical
performance by consulting with my superiors and seniors. There are only a few female security guards. I
am proud of my work, and will continue to make the utmost efforts to ensure that everyone in the base can
work in a safe environment.

4) For details on employment information, see <http://www.mod.go.jp/j/saiyou/>
5) Until fiscal 2006, there were two systems applied to employment of SDF Regular Personnel who are 18
years old or over as candidates for “enlisted (upper)”: the “Student Candidate for Enlisted (Upper)
System” and the “Enlisted (Upper) Candidate System.” In fiscal 2007, the two systems were reorganized
and unified into a new appointment system. It adopts some elements of the “Enlisted (Upper) System,”
which aims to raise awareness of candidates for the Enlisted (Upper), and the “Candidates for the Enlisted
(Upper) System,” which emphasizes individual capabilities in personnel management. Those qualified for
SDF Regular Personnel are recruited as “General Candidates for Enlisted (Upper)” from fiscal 2007.
6) The SDF Youth Cadet system was reviewed, and the recruitment of MSDF Youth Cadets and ASDF
Youth Cadets was abolished; the recruitment round of fiscal 2006 (employment in fiscal 2007) was the
last. Nevertheless, the framework of the GSDF Youth Cadet system will be continued, with the status of
authorized SDF Regular Personnel being changed to non-authorized “Students,” which is the same status
as the National Defense Academy students.
7) SDF personnel must perform duties such as defense operations as specified in the Self-Defense Forces
Law. They are, therefore, designated as special national government employees under Article 2 of the
National Civil Service Law, and personnel management of SDF personnel is conducted independently of
that of general civilian government employees.

10) Details on education and training can be found on the website of each SDF group:
GSDF at <http://www.mod.go.jp/gsdf/>
MSDF at <http://www.mod.go.jp/msdf/>
ASDF at <http://www.mod.go.jp/asdf/>
11) Such external educational institutions in fiscal 2007 include the University of Tokyo and Waseda
University in Japan; and the National Defense University (U.S.) and Harvard University (U.S.) overseas.
12) Institutes of each SDF where high-ranking SDF officers of each SDF and others receive training on
security, defense strategy, and other subjects.
13) The Joint Staff College is part of the Joint Staff Office and educates high-ranking SDF officers on joint
operations.
14) For example, the GSDF has a Command Post Exercise Center for carrying out command and staff
activities at the division/regiment level, and the Fuji Training Center and urban warfare training facilities
for company-level training.
15) For example, some firing training involving tanks, antitank helicopters, missiles, long-range artillery,
surface-to-air guided missiles (improved Hawk and Patriot System), surface-to-surface missile, torpedoes,
and other weapons, cannot be carried out at some firing ranges in Japan, or is prohibited in Japan as
ranges exceed domestic limits. There are also various restrictions on exercises by large-scale units that

Development of the Next Generation.
18) The Memorial Stone of SDF Martyrs to Duty was established in 1962, and reinforced in 1980, due to
aging through weathering. Afterwards, when the headquarters of the Defense Agency (at the time) was
moved to Ichigaya in 1998, the Memorial Zone was located on the east side of the memorial area with the
Memorial Stone of SDF Martyrs to Duty and other monuments. However, because it did not have enough
space for memorial ceremonies involving the Guard of Honor to take place, renovation of the area started
in 2002, with its space expanded, including space for a resting-space. The renovation was completed in
2003. Today many people visit the Memorial Zone, when they participate in the Ichigaya-dai Tour, which
includes visits to Ichigaya Memorial Hall, the Public and Health Center, and square for the Guard of
Honor ceremony.
19) This is the number from September 2003 to March 2007.
20) “Seclusion from private companies” is stipulated in Article 62 of the Self-Defense Forces Law.
21) Superiority in prompt and accurate recognition, gathering, processing, and dissemination of information.

Common Operating Environment (COE: Basic group of software commonly used by computer systems
maintained by each service of the SDF), and the Central Command System (CCS: central command
system that conducts data aggregation processing and other data processing by online-connecting the
command system of each SDF service), see <http://www.mod.go.jp/j/library/archives/it/youkou/>
23) For example, as part of U.S.-Japan defense cooperation, the “Memorandum of Understanding Concerning
Cooperation Regarding Information Assurance and Computer Network Defense” (MOU), which aims to
strengthen the response to cyber attacks by exchanging information between Japan and the United States,
was concluded in April 2006.
24) The five policy targets are “Enhancement in Gathering/Communicating Information in the Chain of
Command (Vertical Direction)”; “Promotion of Intelligence Sharing Among Units (Horizontal
Direction)”; “Establishment of System to Cope with Cyber Attacks”; “Promotion of Intelligence Sharing
with External Organizations”; and “Enhancement of Various Telecommunication Infrastructures.”
25) The Basic Policies for Economic and Fiscal Management and Structural Reform (approved by the
Cabinet on July 7, 2006) also presents the significance of “3. Transforming procurement of SDF
equipment, material, stock components, and other items so as to make procurement more efficient and
streamlined.”
26) See <http://www.mod.go.jp/trdi/>
27) a) “Operational Demonstration Research” is introduced. In this type of research, the SDF service (the
future operator) will evaluate the prototypes of the equipment. The evaluation will be reflected onto the
later R&D, procurement, and related operations.
b) “Evolutionary Development” is introduced. At the start of the development phase, the performance
requirements to be achieved are left undecided. Even after the start of the development phase, the
precision of required performance can be upgraded, and up-to-date military science technology can be
newly introduced.

28) This council was established in September 2003 by the former Defense Agency, the Ministry of
Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, and
the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport. It was established to promote development of civil
aircraft and engines based on initiative taken by our nation as a whole. This is important in the
sophistication of our country’s industrial infrastructure, as well as the development and dissemination of
industrial technology.
29) This is a generic term for facilities used by the SDF, and facilities and areas used by the U.S. Forces in
Japan based on the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty. It includes maneuver areas, airfields, ports,
communication stations, quarters, warehouses, ammunition depots, and fuel bunkers.
30) The land area covered by defense facilities (approximately 1,397 km[2]) is the total of those for the SDF
facilities (approximately 1,085 km[2]), facilities and areas exclusively used by USFJ (approximately 309
km[2]), and non-SDF facilities jointly used by USFJ under the Status of Forces Agreement (approximately
4 km[2]).
31) 1) Residents around five airfields, including Komatsu Airfield (in Ishikawa Prefecture), have filed
lawsuits demanding a ban on nighttime takeoffs and landings, and claiming compensation for damage
caused by noise. In some of these lawsuits, the court has ordered the national Government to pay
“compensation for past damage” in its final and conclusive judgment; 2) On the other hand, some of the
residents who have been annoyed by noise but have not filed lawsuits felt that they have not been treated
fairly. These residents claimed the same monetary compensation for past damage as ordered by the court
in past noise-related lawsuits, and started a campaign for establishing a damage compensation system (socalled “Fair Compensation Movement”); 3) Local public organizations and residents in the vicinity of
defense facilities requested that various measures be expanded and enhanced.

that they were interested in the SDF and defense issues, and about 85% had a “Good” impression of the
SDF. For details, see Reference 61. Additionally, in a “Special Opinion Poll on Humanitarian and
Reconstruction Assistance Activities in Iraq by SDF” in September 2006, about 72% of respondents who
had seen and heard reports on SDF activities in Iraq, which accounted for 91% of all respondents, replied
that they “value” such activities.

members, one ASDF member) were arrested, or their case files were referred to the Public Prosecutors
Office, on charges of violating the Cannabis Control Law, and other related laws.

**Reference 8. Written Answers to the Questions by Representatives Seiichi Inaba on the**
**Constitution, International Law and the Right of Collective Self-Defense**
**(submitted on May 29, 1981) —Excerpt—**


The relationship between the right of collective self-defense, Article 9 of the Constitution, and
international law is not necessarily explicit. Since the situation at hand requires the elucidation of this
relationship, the following questions were submitted.
1. Unified definition as a Cabinet
2. It is beyond doubt that as a sovereign state, Japan has the right of self-defense under existing
international law; however, is the right of collective self-defense included herein?
3. Does the Constitution ban the right of collective self-defense and if it is banned, in which article is that
stipulated?
4. Is the collective self-defense not being implemented from a policy standpoint and not from the fact
that it is banned?
5. Realistically, does Japan face disadvantages in national defense due to the fact that it does not have the
right of collective self-defense?

Answers to 1 through 5
Under international law, it is understood that a state has the right of collective self-defense, that is, the right to
use force to stop an armed attack on a foreign country with which it has close relations, even when the state
itself is not under direct attack.
It is self-evident that Japan has the right of collective self-defense under international law since it is a
sovereign state, but that the exercise of the right of collective self-defense is not permissible under the
Constitution, since the exercise of the right of self-defense as authorized under Article 9 of the Constitution is
confined to the minimum necessary level for the defense of the country and the exercise of the right of
collective self-defense exceeds that limit.
In addition, Japan views the exercise of the right of self-defense within the limit of minimum necessary
level for the defense of the nation, and therefore, the Constitution’s preclusion of the right to exercise the right
of collective self-defense does not generate disadvantages.

**Reference 9. Written Answers to the Questions by Representative Muneo Suzuki on the**
**Right of Self-Defense (submitted on May 11, 2007) —Excerpt—**

1. What is the definition of the right of self-defense?
2. Under what circumstances is the right of self-defense allowed to be exercised?
3. What is the definition of the right of collective self-defense?
4. Does the current Constitution allow the right of collective self-defense?


Answers to 1 through 4
The Government has understood that Article 9 of the Constitution does not go so far as to prohibit use of the
minimum force necessary to eliminate an armed attack by a foreign country, which would expose the lives and
the bodies of the Japanese to danger. It is generally understood under international law that the right of
collective self-defense is one that justifies the use of force by a state to stop an armed attack on a foreign


-----

country with which it has close relations, even when the state itself is not under direct attack. The Government
has understood that the exercise of the right of collective self-defense is not permitted under the Constitution.
In his policy speech in the 166th session of the Diet, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said, “It is necessary for
the Government to rebuild a legal foundation to ensure national security that fits the present era and to promote
study on individual and specific cases in security situations in order to find what actions would constitute the
exercise of the right of collective self-defense, which is prohibited under the Constitution.” Based on the Diet
remarks by Prime Minister Abe, the Government has decided to set up under the Prime Minister an informal
panel on the rebuilding of a legal foundation for national security, which is in charge of studying the
clarification of relations between the Constitution and various security actions, including the exercise of the
right of collective self-defense, by referring to individual and specific cases in security situations.

**Reference 10. Basic Policy for National Defense**

(Adopted by the National Defense Council and approved by the Cabinet on May 20, 1957)

The aim of national defense is to prevent direct and indirect aggression and to repel any such aggression with
the aim of protecting Japan’s independence and peace, which are founded on democracy.
In order to achieve this, the Basic Policy states as follows:
(1) To support the U.N. activities and promote international cooperation to achieve world peace.
(2) To stabilize the livelihood of the people, promote their patriotism, and establish the foundations required for
national security.
(3) Within the limits required for self-defense, to progressively establish efficient defense capabilities in
accordance with the nation’s strength and situation.
(4) To deal with external act of aggression based on the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements, until the United
Nations can provide sufficient functions to effectively prevent such acts in the future.

(Approved by the Security Council and the Cabinet on December 10, 2004)

**I. Purpose**
**II. Security Environment Surrounding Japan**
**III. Basic Principles of Japan’s Security Policy**
**IV. Future Defense Forces**
**V. Additional Elements for Consideration**

**I. Purpose**
In order to ensure the peace and safety of Japan and peace and stability of the international community, given
the current security environment surrounding our country, the Security Council and Cabinet of the Government
of Japan approved the “National Defense Program Guidelines, FY 2005-.” The Guidelines build on the
December 19, 2003 Security Council and Cabinet decision, “On Introduction of Ballistic Missile Defense
System and Other Measures.”


-----

**II. Security Environment Surrounding Japan**
1. The 9/11 terrorist attacks on the United States demonstrated that, in addition to such traditional problems
as inter-state military confrontations, non-state actors such as international terrorist organizations have
emerged as a dire threat in today’s security environment.
Against a backdrop of increased interdependence and growing globalization, the international
community is facing urgent new threats and diverse situations to peace and security, including the
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles, as well as international terrorist
activities (hereinafter “new threats and diverse situations”). We need to bear in mind that conventional
forms of deterrence may no longer work effectively against international terrorist organizations, which
have neither states nor citizens to protect.
Ten years have passed since the end of the Cold War. Mutual cooperation and interdependence among
major countries have deepened, as exemplified by the growing trust between the United States and the
Russian Federation. Since a stable international environment serves the interests of all nations, greater
efforts at international coordination and cooperation on security issues have taken root in the international
community, including those within the framework of international organizations such as the United
Nations.
In this context, the United States, as the sole superpower, continues to contribute significantly to
international peace and stability by taking active measures to combat terrorism and to prevent proliferation
of weapons of mass destruction.
In the meantime, the use of military force now plays a broader role in the international community
than simply deterring or responding to armed conflict: Military force is also used for a variety of purposes,
including the prevention of conflict and the reconstruction assistance.
2. As a result of the further expansion and deepening of interdependence among the nations in recent years,
greater efforts are also being made to promote and strengthen bilateral and multilateral coordination and
cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region. However, although Russia has drastically reduced its armed forces
in the Far East since the end of the Cold War, massive military might, including nuclear arsenals, continue
to exist in the region, and a number of countries are pouring in efforts to modernize their military forces.
The situation on the Korean Peninsula is unpredictable and cross-Taiwan Strait relations remain uncertain.
North Korea is engaged in the development, deployment and proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction and ballistic missiles, and it maintains a large number of special operations forces. Such
military activities by North Korea constitute a major destabilizing factor to regional and international
security, and are a serious challenge to international non-proliferation efforts.
China, which has a major impact on regional security, continues to modernize its nuclear forces and
missile capabilities as well as its naval and air forces. China is also expanding its area of operation at sea.
We will have to remain attentive to its future actions.
The close and cooperative relationship between Japan and the United States, based on the Japan-U.S.
Security Arrangements, continues to play an important role for the security of Japan as well as for peace
and stability in the Asia-Pacific region.
3. In light of the security environment surrounding our country, as outlined above, even though a full-scale
invasion against Japan is increasingly unlikely, Japan must now deal with new threats and diverse
situations in addition to regional security issues.
4. In considering Japan’s security, we have to take into account vulnerabilities resulting from: limited
strategic depth; long coast lines and numerous small islands; a high population density; the concentration
of population and industry in urban areas; and a large number of important facilities in coastal areas, in


-----

addition to frequent natural disasters due to Japan’s geological and climatic conditions, and the security of
sea lines of communication which are indispensable to the country’s prosperity and growth.

**III. Basic Principles of Japan’s Security Policy**
1. Basic Principles
The first objective of Japan’s security policy is to prevent any threat from reaching Japan and, in the event
that it does, repel it and minimize any damage. The second objective is to improve the international
security environment so as to reduce the chances that any threat will reach Japan in the first place. Japan
will achieve these objectives by both its own efforts as well as cooperative efforts with the United States,
Japan’s alliance partner, and with the international community.
To this end, Japan will: support United Nations activities for international peace and security; make
diplomatic efforts to promote cooperative relationships with other countries; further develop its close
cooperative relationship with the United States, based on the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements; establish
a basis for national security by preserving domestic political stability; and, develop efficient defense
forces.
Based on the Constitution of Japan, and the ideas of maintaining the exclusively defensive defense
policy by not becoming a military power that might pose a threat to other countries, Japan will continue to
uphold the fundamental principles of developing modest defense forces of its own under civilian control
and will continue to adhere to the three non-nuclear principles.
To protect its territory and people against the threat of nuclear weapons, Japan will continue to rely on
the U.S. nuclear deterrent. At the same time, Japan will play an active role in creating a world free of
nuclear weapons by taking realistic step-by-step measures for nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation.
Japan also will play an active role in international disarmament and non-proliferation efforts regarding
other types of weapons of mass destruction and their delivery means, such as missiles.
2. Japan’s Own Efforts
(1) Basic Ideas
Based on the premise that any country’s security depends first and foremost on its own efforts, Japan
will utilize all appropriate means to prevent any threat from reaching the country. In addition, based
on the principle of acting closely with the international community and its alliance partner—the
United States—Japan will engage in diplomatic and other activities to improve the international
security environment so as to prevent the emergence of any new threats.
(2) Japan’s Integrated Response
In the event that these efforts fail to prevent a threat from reaching Japan, the Government of Japan
will take an integrated response by swiftly making appropriate decisions through mechanisms such as
the Security Council, and bringing together all relevant organizations. To this end, the Government
will improve its ability to collect and analyze information which serves as the basis of the
Government’s decision-making. The Self-Defense Forces, police, Japan Coast Guard and other
relevant organizations will improve their close cooperation through increased intelligence sharing,
joint exercises, and other activities, while appropriately sharing their roles, and improve their overall
performances. In addition, the Government will establish national protection systems including those
for responding to different types of disasters, by quickly issuing warning signals and promoting
mutual cooperation between the central and local governments.
(3) Japan’s Defense Forces
Japan’s defense forces are the ultimate guarantee of its national security, representing Japan’s will
and ability to repel any threat that might reach its shores.


-----

Japan has developed its defense forces in accordance with the “National Defense Program
Guidelines, FY 1996-” (The Security Council and Cabinet decision on November 28, 1995) which
incorporated the key elements of the Basic Defense Force Concept. The Basic Defense Force Concept
espouses the idea that, rather than preparing to directly counter a military threat, Japan, as an
independent state, should maintain the minimum necessary basic defense forces lest it becomes a
destabilizing factor in the region by creating a power vacuum. Combined with the Japan-U.S.
Security Arrangements, this concept has been successful in preventing an armed invasion from
occurring.
Given the new security environment, however, future defense forces should be capable of
effectively responding to new threats and diverse situations while maintaining those elements of the
Basic Defense Force Concept that remain valid. Because the peace and stability of Japan is
inextricably linked to that of the international community, Japan should voluntarily and actively
participate in activities that nations of the world cooperatively undertake to enhance the international
security environment (hereinafter “international peace cooperation activities”).
In developing Japan’s defense forces, we have to take into account the fact that while the roles
that our defense forces have to play are multiplying, the number of young people in Japan is declining
as a result of the low birth rate, and fiscal conditions continue to deteriorate.
From this standpoint, Japan will develop multi-functional, flexible, and effective defense forces
that are highly ready, mobile, adaptable and multi-purpose, and are equipped with state-of-the-art
technologies and intelligence capabilities measuring up to the military-technological level of other
major countries. In building such a defense force, without expanding its size, the Government of
Japan will rationalize and streamline personnel, equipment, and operations so as to attain greater
results with the limited resources that are available.
3. Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements
The Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements are indispensable in ensuring Japan’s security. In addition, the
U.S. military presence is critically important to peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region, where
unpredictability and uncertainty continue to persist.
Close cooperative relations between Japan and the United States, based on the Japan-U.S. Security
Arrangements, play an important role in facilitating international efforts to prevent or to respond to new
threats and diverse situations, such as terrorism and ballistic missiles attacks.
Japan will proactively engage in strategic dialogue with the United States on wide-ranging security
issues such as role-sharing between the two countries and U.S. military posture, including the structure of
U.S. forces in Japan, while working to harmonize our perceptions of the new security environment and
appropriate strategic objectives.
In doing so, the Government of Japan will bear in mind the need to reduce the excessive burden that
the existence of U.S. military bases and facilities places on local communities, while maintaining the
deterrent that the U.S. military presence in Japan provides.
In addition, Japan will continue to strengthen the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements by actively
promoting such measures as: intelligence exchange; operational cooperation, including in “situations in
areas surrounding Japan”; cooperation on ballistic missile defense; equipment and technology exchange;
and, efforts to make the stationing of U.S. forces in Japan smoother and more efficient.
4. Cooperation with the International Community
In order to improve the international security environment and help maintain security and prosperity of
Japan, the Government of Japan will actively engage in diplomatic efforts, including the strategic use of
Official Development Assistance (ODA).


-----

Based on the recognition that the destabilization of the international community by events such as
regional conflicts, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and international terrorist attacks would
directly affect its own peace and security, Japan will, on its own initiative, actively participate in
international peace cooperation activities as an integral part of its diplomatic efforts.
In particular, stability in the region spreading from the Middle East to East Asia is critical to Japan.
Japan traditionally has close economic ties with this region, its sea lines of communication run through the
region, and Japan depends almost entirely on energy and natural resources from overseas. In this context,
Japan will strive to stabilize the region by promoting various cooperative efforts in conjunction with other
countries sharing common security challenges.
In order to enable the international community to effectively address the range of new issues in the
twenty-first century, measures must be taken to reform the world’s only global and comprehensive
international organization—the United Nations—to make it more effective and reliable. Japan will
actively pursue this goal.
In the Asia-Pacific region, multilateral frameworks for regional security, such as the ASEAN Regional
Forum (ARF), as well as multilateral efforts to deal with common agendas such as counter-terrorism and
counter-piracy are taking root. By continuing to support these positive developments, Japan will continue
to play an appropriate role, together with the cooperation with the United States, to promote a stable
security environment in the region.

**IV. Future Defense Forces**
1. Role of the Defense Forces
Based on the recognition described above, Japan will develop and maintain, in an efficient manner, the
necessary Self-Defense Forces posture to effectively carry out missions in the following areas:
(1) Effective Response to the New Threats and Diverse Situations
Japan will deal effectively with the new threats and diverse situations by developing highly
responsive and mobile defense force units capable of responding properly to various different
situations and by deploying them appropriately in accordance with Japan’s geographical
characteristics. Should such a situation emerges, the defense forces will respond quickly and
appropriately in smooth and close collaboration with the police and other relevant organizations,
thereby providing a seamless response to the situation in accordance with circumstances and
designated roles.
Japan’s Self-Defense Forces posture to address the key elements of the new threats and diverse
situations will be as follows:
a. Response to Ballistic Missile Attacks
We will respond to ballistic missile attacks by establishing necessary defense force structure,
including the introduction of ballistic missile defense systems, to deal effectively with ballistic
missile attacks. We will adequately respond to the threat of nuclear weapons by doing so, in
addition to relying on U.S. nuclear deterrence.
b. Response to Guerrillas and Special Operations Forces Attacks
We will maintain necessary defense force structure to respond effectively to attacks carried out by
guerrillas and special operations forces. We will also enhance readiness and mobility of the
defense force units, and deal with such attacks in a flexible manner.
c. Response to the Invasion of Japan’s Offshore Islands
We will maintain necessary defense force structure to respond effectively to the invasion of
Japan’s offshore islands, improve and strengthen capabilities to transport and deploy forces, and
deal with the invasion in a flexible manner.


-----

d. Patrol and Surveillance in the Sea and Airspace Surrounding Japan, and Response to the Violation
of Japan’s Airspace and the Intrusion of Armed Special-Purpose Ships and Other Similar Vessels
We will maintain necessary defense force structure, including ships, aircraft and other assets, to
carry out around-the-clock patrol and surveillance in the sea and airspace surrounding Japan. We
will also maintain fighter aircraft units to respond instantly to the violation of our territorial
airspace, as well as combatant ships and other assets in order to respond to armed special-purpose
ships operating in waters surrounding Japan, submerged foreign submarines operating in Japan’s
territorial waters, and other similar vessels.
e. Response to Large-Scale and/or Special-Type (Nuclear, Biological, Chemical, and Radiological)
Disasters
To deal effectively with large-scale and/or special-type (nuclear, biological, chemical, and
radiological) disasters, where protection of life and property is desperately needed, we will
maintain an adequate force structure with defense force units, as well as specialized capabilities
and expertise to conduct disaster relief operations in any part of Japan.
(2) Preparations to Deal with Full-Scale Invasion
Since in our judgment, the likelihood of full-scale invasion of Japan has declined and is expected to
remain modest in the foreseeable future, we will modify our current defense force building concept
that emphasized Cold War-type anti-tank warfare, anti-submarine warfare and anti-air warfare, and
will significantly reduce the personnel and equipment earmarked for a full-scale invasion. However,
because the original role of our defense forces is to cope with full-scale invasion and reconstructing
these forces can not be accomplished in a short period of time, Japan will continue to maintain the
most basic capabilities of its defense forces, while also taking into account developments in
neighboring countries and making use of technological progress.
(3) Proactive Efforts to Improve the International Security Environment
In order to engage actively in international peace cooperation activities, we will take the following
measures: develop education and training systems, highly responsive force posture for relevant units,
and transport and other required capabilities; establish necessary infrastructure to quickly dispatch
defense force units overseas and to carry out missions continuously; and, make necessary
arrangements to include the promotion of international peace cooperation activities in the SelfDefense Forces mission priorities.
We will strongly promote activities for international peace and stability, including security
dialogue and defense exchanges, bilateral and multilateral training and exercises, and arms control
and disarmament efforts carried out by international organizations such as the United Nations.
2. Critical Elements of Our Defense Capabilities
Following are the critical elements for developing defense forces capable of carrying out the missions
described above.
(1) Enhancing Joint Operation Capabilities
In order to have three services of the Self-Defense Forces work integrally and to enable them to
execute their missions swiftly and effectively, we will employ them jointly whenever possible. We
will create a central organization to facilitate joint operations, and establish infrastructure for training
and education as well as intelligence and communications. In doing so, we will reexamine existing
organizations so as to enhance their efficiency.
(2) Strengthening Intelligence Capabilities
In order to employ our defense forces successfully to respond effectively to the new threats and
diverse situations, it is imperative for the Government to be able to identify events at the earliest


-----

possible time and to collect, analyze, and share intelligence promptly and accurately. For this purpose,
we will strengthen our diversified intelligence collection capability and enhance our comprehensive
analysis and assessment capability, keeping in mind the changes in the security environment and
technological trends. We will also strengthen the Self-Defense Forces’ intelligence structure,
including the Defense Intelligence Headquarters, that supports our capabilities. In this way, we will
build a sophisticated intelligence capability.
(3) Incorporating the Progress in Science and Technology into Our Defense Forces
We will incorporate the outcome of science and technological progress, in such areas as information
and communications technologies, into our defense forces. In particular, we will develop the
command and control systems and agile intelligence sharing systems that are indispensable for joint
operations, in tune with information and communication technologies available at home and overseas.
In addition, we will create advanced systems for command and communications and a network for
information and communications, with sufficient protection against possible cyber attacks, to enhance
operational and organizational efficiency.
(4) Utilizing Human Resources More Efficiently
We will take various measures to maintain high morale and firm discipline within the Self-Defense
Forces. We will recruit, cultivate, train and educate high quality personnel to meet the challenge of
the diversification and internationalization of Self-Defense Forces missions, and the need to properly
operate rapidly advancing high-tech equipment. In addition, we will promote activities related to
research and education on security issue, and develop human resources.
The defense force level required to fulfill missions described above is indicated in the attached
table.

**V. Additional Elements for Consideration**
1. In developing, maintaining, and operating the defense forces as described in section IV, the following
elements will be taken into consideration.
(1) Mindful of increasingly severe fiscal conditions, we will restrict defense expenditures by further
rationalizing and streamlining defense forces. We will also work to make our defense forces
successful in carrying out their missions by harmonizing their operations with other measures taken
by the Government.
(2) We will make procurement and research and development (R&D) more effective and efficient by
taking the following measures: curbing life-cycle cost, including purchase price, of defense
equipment; actively using cutting-edge technologies developed by private enterprises, universities,
and governmental organizations in carrying out R&D as well as by allocating R&D resource in a
more focused manner; and, appropriately and timely reviewing various R&D projects. At the same
time, we will work to establish defense production and technological base, especially in core
technological areas indispensable for our national security.
(3) In order to efficiently develop and maintain defense-related facilities, the Government of Japan will,
in close cooperation with relevant local authorities, take various measures to make those facilities
coexist more harmoniously with local communities.
2. These National Defense Program Guidelines provide the vision for our defense forces for the next decade.
However, five years from now or in case there is a significant change in the international situation, we will
review and, if necessary, revise the Guidelines in light of the security environment, technological progress,
and other relevant factors at the time.

**I. Policies for the Program**
From FY 2005 to FY 2009, the Government of Japan (GOJ) will build up Japan’s defense forces based on the
following plan, in accordance with “National Defense Program Guidelines, FY 2005-” (adopted by the Security
Council and the Cabinet on December 10, 2004. Hereinafter the new NDPG).
1. In order to effectively respond to new threats and diverse situations as well as to voluntarily and
proactively participate in activities that nations of the world cooperatively undertake to enhance the
international security environment (hereinafter “international peace cooperation activities”), the GOJ will
efficiently establish multi-functional, flexible and effective defense forces that are highly ready, mobile,
adaptable and multi-purpose, and are equipped with state-of-the-art technologies and intelligence
capabilities, while maintaining the most basic capabilities to cope with large-scale invasion.
2. Under the new security environment, the GOJ will review current organs of defense administration, and
transfer the major units and main equipment of the Self Defense Forces (SDF) to the new defense forces
prescribed in the new NDPG while reducing equipment and personnel earmarked for large-scale invasion.

defense forces such as: procuring defense equipment more effectively and efficiently; and improving
cooperative ties with related administrative institutions and local communities.
5. The Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements are indispensable in ensuring Japan’s security. In addition, the
U.S. military presence is critically important to peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region. Moreover,
close cooperative relationship between Japan and the U.S. based on the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements
plays an important role in facilitating international efforts in security fields. The GOJ will promote
measures to further strengthen the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements and the close relations with the U.S.
based on the Arrangements.
6. Mindful of seriously deteriorating fiscal conditions, and with due consideration paid to other national
measures, the GOJ will restrict defense expenditures by further rationalizing and streamlining defense
forces.

for Defense.
3. Concerning the Ground Self-Defense Force (GSDF), the GOJ will: transform five Divisions, one Brigade
and two combined Brigades, among which a Division and two Combined Brigades are converted into
three Brigades, in order to improve readiness and mobility, while reducing number of tanks and artillery;
and establish the Central Readiness Force that administrates and operates units for nation-wide mobile
operations and special tasks. The authorized number of GSDF personnel will be around 161,000 persons
(152,000 persons for regular personnel and 8,000 persons for reservists) at the end of the FY 2009. The
actual number of GSDF regular personnel will be approximately 146,000 at the end of FY 2009.
4. Concerning the Maritime Self-Defense Force, the GOJ will consolidate the number of the Escort divisions
of the Destroyer unit for mobile operations into eight, each of which is deployed four destroyers; and
abolish one of Escort divisions for regional deployment. The GOJ also consolidate the number of divisions
of the Submarine unit into five, Flight Squadrons of Fixed-wings Patrol Aircraft unit into four and Patrol
Helicopter unit into five.
5. Concerning the Air Self-Defense Force, the GOJ will transform the Early Warning Group into that
composed with two squadrons. The GOJ will establish the first Aerial Refueling Transport Unit.

demand protection of human lives and properties in cooperation with related institutions, the GOJ will
take measures to help the SDF units improve necessary capabilities.
2. Preparations to Deal with Large-Scale Invasion of Japan
Since the likelihood of large-scale invasion of Japan is expected to remain modest in the foreseeable
future, the GOJ will modify our current defense force building concept that emphasized anti-tank warfare,
anti-submarine warfare, and anti-air warfare, and will downsize equipment and personnel earmarked for a
large-scale invasion. At the same time, because reconstructing defense forces can not be accomplished in a
short period of time, while taking into accounts developments in neighboring countries and making use of
technological progress, the GOJ will continue to procure tanks, artillery, mid-range surface-to-air missiles,
destroyers, submarines, minesweepers, patrol aircrafts, fighters, and so on.
3. Voluntary and Proactive Efforts to Improve the International Security Environment

SDF Capabilities), specific numbers of main equipment procurement are shown in the attached table.

**VI. Expenses Required**
1. The limit of the total amount of defense-related expenditures needed for this program is approximately
24.24 trillion yens at the prices of FY 2005.
2. In the annual budget-formulation process, the GOJ will decide it within the framework of the expenditures
required by this Program, while achieving harmony with other Government measures by seeking further
efficiency and rationalization. In case of needs to respond an unforeseeable situation in future, extra
budget, besides the defense related-expenditures shown in I, might be provided within the limit of 100
billion yens on condition that the Security Council of Japan would approve.
The GOJ will continue to respect the spirit of seeking a moderate defense build-up as stated in the
“Program for the Future Build-Up of Defense Capability” (adopted by the Security Council and the
Cabinet in January 24, 1987).
3. Within the limit of the total amount of expenditures to this program, the program will be reviewed if
necessary in three years from now, considering various factors in and outside Japan including international
situations prevailing at that time, global trends in the technologies such as information and communication
technology and Japan’s fiscal condition.

**VII. Others**
1. The GOJ will review the modality of defense forces stated in the new NDPG to make necessary changes,
in five years or when serious situational changes emerge, taking into account security environment and
technological trend at the time.
2. The GOJ will steadily implement projects related to the Special Action Committee on Okinawa (SACO).
The costs required for their implementation will be separately identified.

**Reference 13. Statement by the Chief Cabinet Secretary**

(December 10, 2004)

1. The Government of Japan approved the “National Defense Program Guidelines, FY 2005-” (the new
NDPG) and the “Mid-Term Defense Program, FY 2005-FY 2009” at the Security Council and the Cabinet
Meeting today.
2. In light of the new threats and diverse situations presented by today’s security environment, including the
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles, international terrorism, and other
various situations that affect peace and security, the Government has developed the new NDPG in
recognition of the need to set new guidelines for shaping Japan’s future security and defense.
3. The new NDPG spell out both Japan’s vision for future defense forces as well as the basic principles of its
security policy which underlie that vision. Japan has two basic security policy objectives: (a) to prevent
any threat from reaching Japan and, in the event that it does, to repel it; and (b) to improve the
international security environment in order to prevent any threat from reaching Japan in the first place.
The new NDPG make it clear that, in particular, improving the international security environment is one of
the major pillars of the security policy of Japan, whose prosperity and growth depend heavily on the
security of sea line of communication.
The new NDPG point out that it is necessary to achieve these goals by both its own efforts as well as
cooperative efforts with the United States, Japan’s alliance partner, as well as with the international
community. At the same time, we will continue to firmly uphold the basic principles of our defense policy
that we have ascribed to in accordance with the Constitution of Japan.
4. In implementing this policy, the Government of Japan will employ all available means to prevent any
threat from reaching the country. Should a threat reach Japan, the Government will take an integrated
response, swiftly making appropriate decisions, bringing together all relevant organizations, and having


-----

them cooperate fully. The new NDPG have clearly stated that relevant organizations such as the SelfDefense Forces, the police, and the Japan Coast Guard will utilize all available means and work closely
together to protect Japan and its people. In addition, as a part of its own effort, Japan will engage in
diplomatic and other activities to improve the international security environment so as to prevent the
emergence of any threats. Japan’s defense forces—the ultimate guarantee of its national security—should
be capable of effectively responding to any new threats and diverse situations, while inheriting the
elements of the Basic Defense Force Concept that still remain valid. Japan’s defense forces should also be
capable of actively participating in international peace cooperation activities in order to improve the
international security environment. While roles that the defense forces have to play are multiplying and
fiscal conditions continue to deteriorate, Japan’s future defense forces should be multi-functional, flexible,
and effective while, at the same time, more rationalized and streamlined.
Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements are indispensable to the security of Japan as well as peace and
stability in the Asia-Pacific region. Based on the Arrangements, close cooperative relations between Japan
and its alliance partner, the United States, play an important role in facilitating international efforts to
effectively address new threats and diverse situations. Japan will proactively engage in strategic dialogue
with the United States on wide-ranging security issues such as role-sharing between the two countries and
U.S. military posture, including the U.S. force structure in Japan, while working to harmonize our
perceptions of the new security environment and appropriate strategic objectives in it.
Regarding its cooperation with the international community, Japan will utilize its Official
Development Assistance (ODA) strategically and actively participate in international peace cooperation
activities. The new NDPG have clearly defined these activities as part of our effort to improve the
international security environment.
5. Regarding the future defense force, Japan will develop highly responsive and mobile defense forces
capable of dealing effectively with new threats and diverse situations, and deploy them appropriately in
accordance with Japan’s geographical characteristics. Japan’s future defense forces should be capable of
coping with ballistic missile attacks, attacks carried out by guerrillas and special operations forces, and
invasion of offshore islands. They should also be able to execute patrol and surveillance in the sea and
airspace surrounding Japan, and respond to the violation of airspace, the intrusion of armed specialpurpose ships and other similar vessels, and large-scale and/or special-type (nuclear, biological, chemical,
and radiological) disasters. Should such a situation emerges, the defense forces will respond in smooth and
close collaboration with the police and other relevant organizations, thereby providing a seamless response
to the situation in accordance with circumstances and designated roles.
Since, in our judgment, the likelihood of full-scale invasion of Japan has declined and will remain
modest for the foreseeable future. Thus, based on a fundamental review, we have decided to reduce the
personnel and equipment earmarked for coping with such a contingency. However, because the original
role of our defense forces is to cope with full-scale invasion and reconstructing these forces can not be
accomplished in a short period of time, Japan will continue to maintain the most basic capabilities of its
defense forces, while also taking into account developments in neighboring countries and making use of
technological progress.
In our effort to improve the international security environment, we will establish infrastructure and
make necessary arrangements to engage in international peace cooperation activities. Japan will continue
to strongly promote activities conducive to international peace and stability, such as security dialogue and
defense exchanges.
6. We will continue to firmly maintain its policy of dealing with arms exports control carefully, in light of
Japan’s basic philosophy as a peace-loving nation on which the Three Principles on Arms Exports and
their related policy guidelines are based.


-----

If Japan decides that it will engage in joint development and production of ballistic missile defense
systems with the United States, however, the Three Principles will not be applied, under the condition that
strict control is maintained, because such systems and related activities will contribute to the effective
operation of the Japan-U.S. security arrangements and are conducive to the security of Japan.
In addition, through the process by which the NDPG were developed, questions were raised regarding
how to handle cases of joint development and production with the United States (other than those related
to the ballistic missile defense system) as well as those related to support of counter-terrorism and counterpiracy. Decisions will be made on the basis of individual examination of each case, in light of Japan’s
basic philosophy as a peace-loving nation that aims at avoiding the escalation of international conflicts.
7. Based on the new NDPG, the Government will devise Japan’s vision for international peace cooperation
activities, and take legal and other necessary measures concerning Japan’s security and defense policy,
including placement of international peace cooperation activities in Self-Defense Forces’ mission
priorities, and operational issues pertaining to the ballistic missile defense systems.
8. To clearly indicate the target period in which the planned defense force level will be achieved, the new
NDPG provide the vision for our defense forces for the next decade. In addition, in order to better adjust
our defense policy to the changing security environment, we will review and, if necessary, revise the
NDPG in five years.
9. The “Mid-Term Defense Program, FY 2005-FY 2009” was formulated to achieve the defense forces level
that Japan should possess as provided for in the new NDPG. We expect the total defense-related budget
for the new Mid-Term Defense Program to be approximately ¥24,240 billion measured in constant FY
2004 yen.
10. The Government of Japan will report today’s decision to the Diet. I would sincerely hope that the people
of Japan will understand and give their support to the decision.

Notes: 1. Data sources are national budget books, defense white papers and others.
2. % represents a rate of growth over the previous year.
3. U.S. defense expenditures represent the expense narrowly defined by the historical table FY 2008.
4. The figures for the United Kingdom up to FY 2005 are based on U.K. Defense Statistics published by its Ministry of Defense. The figure in FY
2006 is the expected amount announced in the budget message.
5. The German defense expenditures rose sharply in FY 2006 because the data began to include pension expenditures. The defense
expenditures actually decreased by 0.7% in comparison with FY 2005 when the pension expenditures are excluded.
6. Data for China is based on the Finance Minister’s Budget Report to the National People’s Congress. For the National Defense Budget 2004,
China’s fiscal report stated national defense expenditures would increase, “11.6% by 21.83 billion yuan.” The total expenditures, however,
have not been revealed. As there is a discrepancy in the calculation made on the figures in the said report based on the FY 2003 defense
budget, calculations are made based on the assumed actual expenditure amounts in 2001 and 2003 (unpublished).
7. According to tables and analyses in part two of Military Balance 2007 outlining an international comparison of defense spending and military
strength, defense expenditures for FY 2005 were: U.S. $495,300 million, U.K. $51,696 million, Germany $35,295 million, France $46,232
million, Russia $58,000 million, China $103,956 million and Japan $42,835 million.
8. As for Japan, the upper figures exclude the cost for SACO-related projects (16.5 billion yen in FY 2001, 16.5 billion yen in FY 2002, 26.5

**Reference 24. Congratulatory Speech by Guest at Ceremony Held to Mark the Transition**
**from the Defense Agency to the Ministry of Defense**
**(Former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone)**

I would like to express congratulations on the transition from the Defense Agency to the Ministry of Defense.
Yesterday, we had coming-of-age ceremonies all over Japan. Today is the day for a ceremony which is
designed to celebrate the Defense Agency and the Self-Defense Force (SDF) coming of age. So, I am pleased
to come and attend this ceremony.
As a person who had once headed the Defense Agency, I had been very worried about the direction of the
Defense Agency and people who had worked there, even after I left it. I would like to say that senior officials
and other employees at the Defense Agency must have kept endurance and patience, exercised caution and had
various hardships—until they have seen what they are seeing today. And their efforts, being made until today,
have finally born fruits today. So, I would like to express congratulations from the bottom of my heart for these
fruitful results being finally generated.
Now, our next mission is to stipulate names and roles related to defense in the Constitution. But I don’t
think it will take long time for the mission to get done. Prime Minister Abe is eager to get the mission achieved
and the rest of us are all determined to do it. I hope all of you will unite further in implementing the next
mission and will continue to do your best for the mission.
I would like to take this opportunity to remind you of one issue that arose when the SDF and the Defense
were created. I hope the introduction of the issue will be of some help for the future of Japan. In 1953, then
Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida called a Socialist lawmaker “stupid” in a Diet session, leading to the
dissolution of the Diet. Consequently, Prime Minister Yoshida’s Liberal Party was reduced to a minority
Cabinet, resulting in the formation of a coalition government consisting of three parties—the Constitutional
Reform Party led by Shigemitsu, the Liberal Party led by Yoshida and another Liberal Party led by dissident
Hatoyama that had been spun off from Yoshida’s party. Even before the coalition government was formed, our
Constitutional Reform Party, led by Shigemitsu, had been very vocal about turning around Japan’s defense
system. Because a Cabinet led solely by Yoshida’s party would not be strong enough to cope with Diet
business, we had decided to form a three-party coalition government. A major issue that had emerged at the
time of the formation of the coalition government was what Japan should do about defense. By the time of the
creation of the coalition government, the National Guard already existed, being transformed from the Reserved
Police. But those days, we were convinced that something like the National Guard—an intermediate
organization between the police and the military—could not make Japan’s defense workable for good. We had
strongly believed that we should establish a national system based on the idea of building more regular defense
capabilities. So, we had decided to have each of the three parties send a representative in order to write a new
law—Mr. Naomi Nishimura from the Liberal Party, Mr. Umekichi Nakamura from Hatoyama’s Liberal Party
and myself from the Constitutional Reform Party. And the three of us got together and agreed to adopt a set of
accords for the coalition.
The first problem that was discussed when the law was drawn up was how to define a minimum necessary
level of defense capability under the Constitution. Finally, the three parties agreed that such defense capability
should be defined as being changeable according to changes of international situation, and science and
technology developments, and thus should not be fixed at certain specific levels.
The second problem that faced the three parties was how to treat the idea of “civilian supremacy,” the most
important issue which is also called “civilian control.” Behind Japan’s defeat in the Greater East Asia War was
an issue related to the independence of the supreme authority of commanding the military. When the SDF and
the Defense Agency were to be created, we had had strong determination to solve the issue and endeavored to


-----

establish a system in which the independence of such authority is denied. So, the focus of our efforts was on
how to build a system in which military policies and administrative military duties are integrated. Day and
night, we had worked in order to build such a system. When we had a meeting to discuss the issue those days,
lawmaker Masanobu Tsuji came and shouted, “What you are trying to make would be of no use. How could we
engage in war without recognizing the independence of the supreme authority of commanding the military?”
We countered Mr. Tsuji, saying, “Japan’s defeat resulted from having allowed the independence of the
authority. Any new defense system could not be established without solving the issue related to this authority.
Whether or not we can create a new global defense system based on conventional and old practices—as we did
in the past—is something that needs to be studied.” The civilian-control system we have seen today has thus
stemmed from such difficult process.
“Civilian supremacy” is a rather difficult concept. When we established the idea of civilian control, we
created an internal bureau at the Defense Agency in which councilors were posted. Under the internal-bureau
system, the intention of a Minister and Vice-Ministers is meant to be directly reflected in the internal bureau.
Meanwhile, a Minister and Parliamentary Vice Ministers are supposed to make policy executions inheriting the
intention of the Diet. This is how civilian control works. Our civilian-control system underwent various debates
and met with opposition from former Japanese Imperial soldiers. But we had established the current civiliancontrol system with strong conviction and belief in the concept of “civilian supremacy.” “Civilian supremacy”
can be translated into civilians’ superiority to the military in policy decision-making. But it means that the
Defense Agency’s internal bureau has control over uniformed personnel at the agency. That means that the
Diet and politicians should have control over uniformed personnel. Based on the intention of the Diet and
politicians, a Minister and Parliamentary Vice Ministers are supposed to execute defense policies. Based on
such a clear perception, they are executing defense policies. Assuming that officials at the internal bureau of
the Defense Agency would become harmonious with rank-and-file SDF troops and officers at commanding
posts, and in light of the lesson we had learned from World War II, we had determined to build new defense
capabilities under the newly established civilian-control system.
The idea of “civilian supremacy” does not indicate the superiority of civilian officials at the internal bureau
over uniformed personnel. This was what we had clearly thought. We had confirmed that a Minister, ViceMinisters, the Diet and politicians have superiority.
From now on, the Ministry of Defense will get going. Whether or not the Defense Agency should acquire
the status of ministry is an issue that has been long discussed but is new. Being upgraded to ministry, the
Ministry of Defense is expected to become more self-reliant and more independent, which makes it the most
important for us to maintain “civilian supremacy.” This is a message that I, as one of members who sponsored
a bill to ensure civilian control, want to convey to you.
From today, you can serve Japan and the world with high confidence. I would like to conclude my speech
by sincerely wishing that all of you will take care of your health and work harder for the benefit of Japan, the
Japanese people and world peace. Thank you very much for listening.

**Reference 25. Congratulatory Speech by Guest at Ceremony Held to Mark the Transition**
**from the Defense Agency to the Ministry of Defense**
**(Former Defense Agency Director-General Tsutomu Kawara)**

Congratulations on the Defense Agency’s transition to the Ministry of Defense.
This is an issue for which we had worked for more than a half century since the creation of the agency. And
it is a long-cherished wish that has been finally realized. So, I can imagine how gratifying it is not only for


-----

people who are attending this ceremony today but also for employees across Japan who had worked at the
agency, SDF personnel and people who have provided support to the ministry’s gaining ministry status. The
transition from the Defense Agency to the Ministry of Defense was a policy pledge for our Liberal Democratic
Party (LDP) along with the revision to the Constitution. A proposal to shift the agency to the ministry was
realized with the backing of more than 90% of lawmakers in Japan. In view of the proposal being realized in
such a congratulatory manner, lawmakers attending today’s ceremony, both from the ruling and opposition
camps, as well as Defense Minister Kyuma must be feeling great satisfaction.
Looking back on history, a bill to transition from the Defense Agency to the Ministry of Defense was first
endorsed by the Cabinet in 1964. But the bill was not presented to the Diet. A proposal to enable the agency to
gain ministry status had continued to be a major security and political issue in Japan. I had cherished a strong
belief that a government organization which is in charge of national defense, a basic state duty, should
absolutely have ministry status. I had headed the Defense Agency between 1999 and 2000. But in those days,
transition from the agency to the ministry was found to be premature.
In June 2001, a group of lawmakers, including me, sponsored a bill to create the Ministry of Defense and
presented it to the Diet. Since 2002, I had served as chairman of an LDP parliamentarians’ group on national
defense. In addition, in 2004, I became a representative of lawmakers who were in support of a proposal to
make a transition from the Defense Agency to the Ministry of Defense. Through these efforts, we had tried so
as to enable the proposal to gain momentum and looked for the right timing to make it happen.
It was in last year’s ordinary session of the Diet when the timing appeared to be right. With an
extraordinary Diet session convened in the autumn last year, we were united in pushing the proposal through
the Diet. People who had once headed the Defense Agency banded together to get the proposal submitted to the
Diet. Once the proposal was presented to the Diet, we endeavored so that the proposal would be enacted
without fail. As a person who represented lawmakers who were in support of a proposal to upgrade the Defense
Agency to the Defense Ministry and also as a person who has headed Taiyu-kai, a public-interest entity meant
to deepen mutual understanding between the SDF and the Japanese people, I had made maximum efforts to
realize the proposal at all levels, from the level of the central government to the level of municipality.
The proposal was finally enacted at the end of the extraordinary Diet session as we had eagerly anticipated.
The enactment was so gratifying to me and left me filled with great emotion in view of the process that led to it.
Issues related to the Defense Agency had changed significantly in some 50 years since the creation of the
agency, including missions and activities of the SDF, and the Japanese people’s response to and feeling toward
the SDF. In particular, the developments surrounding the Defense Agency have shown kaleidoscopic changes
in the past several years.
Among the most striking developments were the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States,
which were so shocking as to bring about a significant change in Japan’s national security. Conventional
national security policies were formulated based on the assumption of state-to-state disputes. But the
September 11 event necessitated a state to cope with threat being posed by non-state entities such as
international terrorist organizations.
Based on the Anti-Terrorism Special Measures Law, the Maritime Self-Defense Force (MSDF) began
refueling activities in the Indian Ocean in December 2001. I heard that a total of more than 50 MSDF vessels
have been so far dispatched to the Indian Ocean for a total of more than 700 refueling missions. These
activities have contributed greatly to helping ships of allied countries confiscate drugs and weapons owned by
terrorists and take into custody suspected terrorists. The MSDF’s Indian Ocean activities have received high
acclaim from numerous countries including the United States, the United Kingdom, Pakistan and Afghanistan.


-----

In July 2003, the Law Concerning Special Measures on Humanitarian and Reconstruction Assistance in
Iraq was enacted. Based on the law, Japan dispatched troops of the Air Self-Defense Force (ASDF) to Iraq in
December 2003 while troops of the Ground Self-Defense Force (GSDF) departed for Iraq in January 2004.
The Iraqi situation at that time was very difficult. Deciding to dispatch SDF personnel to a country where
the security situation was far from safe was an extremely difficult issue facing us at that time, although such a
mission would contribute to Iraqi reconstruction. But what is necessary for Japan to ensure its peace and
security is to promote coordination with the international community while strengthening its alliance with the
United States. So, Japan, as a responsible member of the international community, needs to fulfill its
responsibility commensurate to its status in the global society so that Iraqi people can rebuild their country with
great hope for the future. GSDF troops fulfilled their mission safely and returned home in June last year. Their
achievements in Iraq can be described as nothing but “excellent job.”
During their Iraqi aid mission lasting for two years and a half, GSDF troops engaged in humanitarian and
reconstruction activities without opening a single fire and seeing a single person becoming a victim of an
armed attack. Their activities were highly appreciated by the Iraqi people and the Government of Iraq.
In a Japan-U.S. summit held in the United States immediately after the conclusion of the GSDF Iraqi
mission, U.S. President George W. Bush said he thinks that the Japanese people should be proud of the
contribution that has been made by the SDF in its battle against terrorism and also American people are proud
of the United States being able to collaborate with such a brave ally. For now, activities of the SDF have been
drawing worldwide attention. SDF members like you are undertaking assigned duties on behalf of the Japanese
people. High acclaim being given to the SDF indicates nothing but the fact that Japan’s contribution to
international peace has been appreciated greatly. Even now, ASDF troops are silently engaging in airlifting
operations in Iraq. I am proud of their operations. The Japanese people are also proud of them.
The SDF’s activities are not limited to overseas operations such as the Iraqi aid mission. They are also
playing a major role in rescuing people affected by natural disasters in Japan. Among such operations were
rescue works that were conducted in the wake of a major earthquake that hit Niigata areas and a quake that
occurred off western part of Fukuoka Prefecture as well as Great Hanshin-Awaji Earthquake. Here, I would
like to renew my respects to SDF personnel for their great support being provided to the Japanese people in the
event of various natural disasters and accidents.
Against the background of excellent SDF activities and rising appreciation toward their activities both at
home and abroad, a set of contingency bills were submitted to the ordinary session of the Diet in 2002. As a
person who chaired the special committee on Japan’s response to an armed attack situation, I had actively
participated in Diet deliberations on these bills.
The Armed Attack Situation Response Law was enacted in 2003 and the Civil Protection Law in 2004,
both by an overwhelming majority of lawmakers including those from the opposition camp, marking the
establishment of a legal framework for Japan’s contingency response more than 50 years after the end of World
War II. The enactment of these laws was an epoch-making event for Japan as it was able to demonstrate both
domestically and internationally that the country has paved a solid foundation for contingency response.
A major national security-policy issue that remained after the establishment of a contingency legal
framework was a proposal to make a transition from the Defense Agency to the Ministry of Defense, which we
have seen finally realized today.
But policy issues affecting Japan’s national security are not limited to contingency response and the
creation of the Ministry of Defense. A mountain of defense-related issues are awaiting us, including the
implementation of a Japan-U.S. agreement on realigning U.S. forces stationed in Japan, the proposed
establishment of a defense system against ballistic missiles and proposed legislation for promoting
international peace cooperation. Now that the Defense Agency has made a transition to the Ministry of


-----

Defense, we would have to deal with these issues squarely and get Japan’s national security advance in a
steady manner.
Finally, I would like to convey my message to Ministry of Defense officials and SDF personnel. What I
expect you to do under the Ministry of Defense is to engage in their assigned work with a fresh sense of duty. I
want them to implement national security policies as a member of a policy-planning government organization
and get more-than-ever aggressive in implementing these policies, and I hope their activities will lead to
successful results. Please listen to people’s voices sincerely and inherit good traditions that have been passed
down by the SDF. You have to keep in mind the fact that the future of the Japanese people rests on your
shoulders. I want you to fulfill your assigned duty while living up to expectations of the Japanese people.
Now I would like to conclude my congratulatory speech.

**Reference 26. Statement by the Chief Cabinet Secretary on the Joint Japan-U.S.**
**Technical Research on the Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD)**

(December 25, 1998)

1. Today, on the approval by the Security Council of Japan, the government of Japan decided to launch on
joint technical research with the United States of America on the Navy’s Theater Wide Defense (NTWD)
System starting on FY 1999.
2. Given the trend of proliferation of nuclear weapons and other the weapons of mass destruction and
ballistic missiles after the end of the cold war, the government considers that the issue of the ballistic
missile defense (BMD) is a crucial one for Japan’s defense policies that rely on exclusively defenseoriented defense policy and that Japan should actively lead the issue of BMD. Thus, we have been making
necessary studies discussions on the issue.
3. The government of Japan considers that launching joint Japan-U.S. technical research on NTWD is the
most effective as well as most productive measures the government should take in the future and that such
cooperation between Japan and the United States will contribute to the improvement of reliability of
Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements.
4. While there is no doubt that the official interpretation of the Diet resolutions should be carried out by the
Diet itself, the government of Japan takes position on the relevance of this matter with the Diet resolution
on development and use of the outer space as follow. Considering the recent situation where ballistic
missiles are on the trend of proliferation, and the fact that BMD system is a inherently defensive as well as
unsubstitutable and only measure to protect the lives and properties of the people of Japan, the government
of Japan determines that active involvement of Japan in the BMD system agrees with the purport of the
Diet resolution concerned and the basic policy of Japan as the peaceful nation, which the purport of the
resolution relies on. Thereby the Government also determines that the people will understand and support
our decision.
It should be noted that the Diet resolution of September this year by the lower house regarding the
ballistic missile launch by North Korea states: “The Government will take every measure to ensure the
safety of the people of the nation.”
It should also be noted that technical transfer of weapons related to BMD will be carried out within the
framework of the agreements on the technical transfer of the weapons to the United States.
5. This resolution refers only to the technical research and not to the transition of the government action to
the stages of development and/or deployment of such weapons, which should be determined separately.
Such determination will be made upon thorough review of technical feasibility of the BMD and the visions
of the Japan’s defense policies in the future.

**Reference 27. Preparation of Ballistic Missile Defense System, etc.**

(Adopted by the Security Council of Japan and approved by the Cabinet on December 19, 2003)

**(Preparation of Ballistic Missile Defense System)**
1. On the issue of the ballistic missile defense (BMD), under the recognition that Japan should take active
measures on the issue given the advancement of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and ballistic
missiles, the Mid-Term Defense Program (FY 2001 to FY 2005) (hereinafter “MTDP”), which was
adopted by the Security Council of Japan and approved by the Cabinet on December 15, 2003, stipulates
that “necessary measures will be taken upon the review of its technical feasibility.” As recent tests of
various kinds have confirmed the high technical feasibility of the BMD, development of the BMD system
has become feasible upon the improvement of capacities and joint operation of the existing Aegis systemequipped destroyers and the surface-to-air PATRIOT guided missile system. Thus, considering that the
BMD system is the inherently defensive as well as unsubstitutable and is the only measure to protect the
lives and properties of the people of Japan against ballistic missile attacks, the system agrees with the
Japan’s exclusively defense-oriented policy. Consequently, the Government of Japan determines to equip
the nation with the same system.

**(Review of Japan’s Defense Capabilities)**
2. Regarding the security environment surrounding Japan, while large-scale invasion by a third country into
Japan has become less likely, measures against the increasing proliferation of weapons of mass destruction
and ballistic missiles, activities of international terrorist groups and other types of new forms of threats as
well as diverse contingencies that is likely to have negative impact on the peace and security of the nation
(hereinafter “the new threats, etc.”) has been urgently needed for the international community. In order for
peace and stability of the nation and the international community, Japan also needs to take all possible
measures against such new threats, etc. through comprehensive and prompt responses under the organic
coordination of diplomatic effort promotion, effective operation of defense forces and other measures,
while firmly maintaining the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements. When such new security environment
and the introduction of the BMD system are considered, we come to a conclusion that the whole defense
capacities of Japan need to be reviewed.
To this end, we will make effectual measures against the new threats, etc. according to the specific
features of each of them while maintaining close cooperation with concerned agencies and local
communities, further developing cooperative relationship with the United States. based on the Japan-U.S.
Security Arrangements, and promoting cooperation with neighboring nations and other nations and
international organizations concerned. At the same time, the Government of Japan will review the whole
defensive capacities of Japan in order to prepare for proactive and affirmative actions that are to be taken
to protect peace and stability of the international community to which Japan belong. In so doing,
preparation of necessary schemes that can effectually deal with the new threats, etc., including terrorist
attacks and ballistic missile attacks, will be prepared, and at the same time the current defense build-up
concept and equipment system will be fundamentally reviewed and appropriate down-sizing will be made,
while taking events of large-scale invasion into consideration. These actions are to build defense forces
that are capable of effectively responding to the new security environment.
Based on the views described above, when renewing the current system of the Self Defense Forces
into a new system, we will pursue for the improvement of readiness, mobility, flexibility and multipurpose functions of the system as well as highly advanced technical capabilities and intelligence


-----

capabilities, and at the same time we will carry out a fundamental review of the existing organizations,
equipment and other items concerned in order to improve their efficiencies. In so doing, the following
items will be focused in order to establish an effectual system.
(1) The current organizations and alike will be reviewed, and new organizations, including an advisory
organization to the Defense Minister, necessary for the operation of the Self Defense Forces that
centers on the joint operation, will be formed.
(2) As for the major units of the Ground, Maritime and Air Self-Defense Forces, new schemes, including
a new organization, will be constructed in order that effectual measures may taken in the events of
new threats, etc.
(3) Necessary functions, organizations and equipments will be prepared in order to readily take actions
that effectively contribute to the peace and security of the international community.
(4) In order to prepare for the unexpected change of the security situations in the future, while securely
retaining the fundamental components to respond to events of large-scale invasion and concerning the
security situations of the surrounding area of Japan, the following measures will be taken.
a. Regarding the Ground Self-Defense Forces, a defense build-up concept focused on the anti-tank
warfare will be developed, and a system that can be promptly respond to the new threats, etc. will
be prepared through improvement of mobility and other capabilities, while the current situation of
tanks, artilleries and other weapons will be reviewed and appropriate down-sizing will be made.
b. Regarding the Maritime Self-Defense Forces, the defense build-up concept will be altered to one
that is focused on anti-submarine warfare, and preparation of a responding system to ballistic
missiles and other new threats, etc. will be attempted, while the current situation of destroyers,
fixed-wing patrol aircraft and other equipment will be reviewed and appropriate down-sizing will
be made.
c. Regarding the Air Self-Defense Forces, the current defense force build-up concept focused on the
anti-combat aircraft welfare will be modified to better prepare for ballistic missile and other new
threats, etc. At the same time, the current situation of combat aircraft and other equipment will be
reviewed and appropriate downsizing and other measures will be taken.

**(Defense-related Expenditures)**
3. When carrying out such a large-scale program as the BMD system preparation, the Government of Japan
will carry out a fundamental review of the existing organizations and equipment of the Self-Defense
Forces based on the items described above (see 2) in order to improve the efficiency, and, at the same
time, makes efforts to reduce the defense-related expenditures to take the harsh economic and fiscal
conditions of Japan into consideration. Based on such views, the government will lay down a new MidTerm Defense Program that will replace the current program by the end of 2004 and determine the limit of
the total amount needed for the same program.

**(Formulation of New Defense Program Guidelines)**
4. As a precursor to the formulation of a new Mid-Term Defense Program, the Government of Japan will
formulate new National Defense Program Outline that will replace the National Defense Program
Guidelines from FY 1996 (adopted by the Security Council of Japan and the Cabinet on November 28,
1995). The new outline will be formulated to adopt the system to the new security environment and follow
the concepts described above (see 1 and 2). We also aim to stipulate our visions for the Japan’s defense
forces, including the position of the Japan’s Self-Defense Forces in the activities to maintain peace and
stability of the international community.

**Reference 28. Statement of the Chief Cabinet Secretary of Japan on the Cabinet**
**Decision, “On Introduction of Ballistic Missile Defense System and Other**
**Measures”**

(December 19, 2003)

1. The Government of Japan decided “On Introduction of Ballistic Missile Defense System and Other
Measures” at the Security Council of Japan and the Cabinet today. This decision shows the thinking
behind the introduction of BMD system, and at the same time, indicates the direction of Japan’s defense
force review taking into account the introduction of BMD system and the new security environment.
Based on this decision, the Government of Japan will formulate a new National Defense Program Outline
and a new Mid-Term Defense Program by the end of the year 2004.
2. The Government of Japan, recognizing that rapid progress on the relevant technologies of BMD has
recently been made and that technological feasibility of BMD system is high, and noting that BMD system
is suitable for our exclusively defense-oriented policy, decided to introduce the multi-tier defense system
based on the Aegis BMD system and Patriot PAC-3 (Patriot Advanced Capability-3).
3. The technical feasibility of the BMD system has confirmed with the results from interception tests and
other capability tests carried out by the United States as well as with the Japan’s original simulation
experiments. Therefore, we concluded that technical reliability of these systems is considerably high and
the technology has reached a sufficiently high level for practical use as we can see from the decision by
the United States on the primary deployment.
4. BMD system is the only and purely defensive measure, without alternatives, to protect life and property of
the citizens of Japan against ballistic missile attacks, and meets the principle of exclusively defenseoriented policy. Therefore, it is considered that this presents no threat to neighboring countries, and does
not affect the regional stability.
5. As for the issue of the right of collective self-defense, the BMD system that the Government of Japan is
introducing aims at defending Japan. It will be operated based on Japan’s independent judgment, and will
not be used for the purpose of defending third countries. Therefore, it does not raise any problems with
regard to the issue of the right of collective self-defense. The BMD system requires interception of
missiles by Japan’s own independent judgment based on the information on the target acquired by Japan’s
own sensors.
6. In legal terms on the operation of the BMD system, interception of ballistic missile attack is basically
conducted as a defense operation that is undertaken in situations regarded as an armed attack against
Japan. In addition, due to the nature of ballistic missile and the characteristics of BMD, the Government
will conduct specific studies on necessary measures including legal ones, which enable appropriate
responses to each situation.
7. The joint Japan-U.S. technical research currently undergoing is not for the system being introduced this
time, but it aims to improve the capability of future interceptor. It remains important to carry on the
research in order to take all possible measures to ensure national defense. The future transition to the
development and deployment stage will be decided separately, taking international situations of the time
and other factors into consideration.
8. Japan will take all possible measures to ensure national defense and prevention of proliferation of weapons
of mass destruction, by ensuring transparency and encouraging international understanding on BMD, and
by promoting further cooperation with the United States on technology and operation.

**Reference 29. Statement by the Chief Cabinet Secretary “Japan-U.S. Cooperative**
**Development of Advanced SM-3 Missile for Ballistic Missile Defense”**
**(tentative translation)**

(December 24, 2005)

1. The Government of Japan, through today’s meetings of the Security Council of Japan and the Cabinet,
decided to initiate Japan-U.S. joint development of advanced SM-3 missile for Ballistic Missile Defense.
2. The Government of Japan has started and promoted Japan-U.S. joint technical research on a sea-based
upper-tier system since 1999 with the understanding that BMD system is the only and purely defensive
measures, without alternatives, to protect the lives and properties of Japanese citizens against ballistic
missile attacks and meets the principles of exclusively defense-oriented policy, in an environment marked
by proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles. This research does not aim at the
BMD system which Japan started to introduce since FY 2004, but aims to improve the future capabilities
of interceptors in order to expand all possible means to ensure Japan’s national defense.
3. “Mid-Term Defense Program (FY 2005-2009)” states “the Government of Japan will consider the
possibility of transition to the development stage, and take necessary measures.” Based on the result of
Japan-U.S. joint technical research to date, the Government of Japan has sufficient prospect for solving the
initial technical challenges. In the current international situation, taking into consideration the continuing
fiscal constraint, we consider it appropriate to promote Japan-U.S. joint development of advanced SM-3
missile efficiently in order to acquire the capability against future ballistic missile threats. Future transition
to deployment stage of the advanced missile will be decided based on the results of the joint development.
4. Regarding the relation with Three Principles on Arms Export, “Statement by the Chief Cabinet Secretary”
for National Defense Program Guidelines, FY 2005- (approved by the Security Council of Japan and the
Cabinet on December 10, 2004), states “if Japan decides that it will engage in joint development and
production of ballistic missile defense systems with the United States, however, the Three Principles on
Arms Exports will not be applied, under the condition that strict control is maintained, because such
systems and related activities will contribute to the effective operation of the Japan-U.S. Security
Arrangements and are conductive to the security of Japan.” We will continue to firmly maintain our policy
of dealing with arms exports control carefully, in light of Japan’s basic philosophy as a peace-loving
nation on which the Three Principles on Arms Exports and their related policy guidelines are based.
Based on these, arms that need to be provided to the United States for the Japan-U.S. joint development
will be provided under strict control after coordinating with the United States in the future on the
framework for arms transfer.
5. Japan will continue to ensure the transparency and increase the international understanding of its BMD
system while further promoting the cooperation in the areas of policy, operation and equipment/technology
with the United States. Through these efforts, Japan will strive to take all possible measures in ensuring its
national defense and preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles.

**Reference 33. Basic Guidelines for the Protection of the Civilians (Outline)**

**Introduction**
The Law Concerning Measures to Ensure the Peace and Security of Japan in Situations in Areas Surrounding
Japan was enacted in June 2003. The law stipulates basic response measures in the event of armed attacks
against Japan from foreign countries. Enacted in June 2004 following the enactment of the situation law was
the Civil Protection Law, which stipulates necessary measures to be taken to protect Civilians life, their bodies
and their assets from armed attacks in situations including one in which Japan comes under armed attacks.
Meanwhile, the Cabinet approved the National Defense Program Outline (NDPO) in December 2004. The
national security goal set under the NDPO is to prevent any threat from reaching Japan and, in the event that it
does, repel it and minimize any damage and to improve the international security environment so as to reduce
the chances that any threat will reach Japan in the first place. Under this background, basic guidelines are to be
set based on Article 32 of the Civil Protection Law.

**Chapter 1 Basic Policy Concerning Implementation of Measures for Protecting Civilians**
The state, local governments, designated state-run public institutions and designated local public institutions do
their utmost in order to implement measures for protecting Civilians appropriately and expeditiously in line
with the Civil Protection Law, other laws, basic guidelines, civil protection plan undertaken by designated
administrative institutions and prefectures, and civil protection plan undertaken by designated public
institutions while taking following points into consideration.
1) Respecting fundamental human rights, limiting the scope of restrictions on citizens’ freedom and rights to
minimum necessary levels, and implementing measures under fair and adequate procedures
2) Ensuring to take procedures and adequately managing documents to enable relief measures to be taken in
an expeditious manner for protection of citizens’ rights and profits
3) Providing citizens with accurate information on situations about armed attacks at an appropriate timing
and in an appropriate manner
4) Ensuring to establish relations of mutual cooperation among the state, local governments and designated
state-run public institutions, and ensuring to promote cooperation among local government, the Defense
Ministry and the SDF when taking measures including requesting SDF units to be dispatched to engage in
civil protection activities
5) Implementing educational and enlightenment measures, improving activities by fire-fighting groups and
voluntarily formed disaster-prevention organizations, and seeking citizens’ support and cooperation in
activities by volunteering groups
6) Respecting the independency of the Red Cross Society of Japan, giving special consideration to freedom
of expression in speech and others by broadcasting business operators, and respecting the independency of
designated state-run public institutions and designated local public institutions
7) When issuing warnings, guiding people for evacuation and engaging in rescue operations, special
considerations are to be given to people needing special protection measures, such as aged people and
handicapped people. When information is collected on the safety of foreign people, adequate measures are
to be taken based on international laws concerning humanitarian protection.
8) Safety measures are to be implemented sufficiently for parties in charge of implementing civil protection
steps, transportation services operators, people providing medical services, parties managing livelihoodrelated facilities and running livelihood-related facilities, and parties providing cooperation in
implementation of civil protection measures.


-----

9) Measures to revise initial instructions issued by the Prime Minister when governors of concerned
prefectures deem it impossible to implement measures being introduced based on the Prime Minister’s
instructions such as an instruction for evacuation

**Chapter 2 Items Concerning Assumed Situations in which Japan Comes under Armed Attacks**
Assumed situations in which Japan comes under armed attacks cannot be defined in a uniformed manner. But
such situations can be roughly categorized into four types. These situations are likely to occur in a compound
manner. Characteristics of each type of situation are explained below.
1) Invasion via landing

-  Prior preparations against the invasion are possible. Advanced evacuation from expected battle areas is
necessary.

-  Generally speaking, areas where civil protection measures are to be implemented are assumed to be
wide.
2) Armed attacks by guerrillas and special forces

-  Activities by these forces cannot be forecast or detected in advance. Damage from attacks by these forces
is assumed to occur in an instant manner.

-  Citizens are to be temporarily evacuated to indoor areas as an immediate step against the attack. Fullfledged evacuation is to follow with safety measures being taken by concerned institutions.
3) Attacks by ballistic missiles

-  Determining the missile’s target area when it was fired is extremely difficult. A missile is to reach its
target extremely quickly after it was fired.

-  It is important to try to localize the missile’s damage area by providing information on the launch in a
speedy manner. Evacuation is to be mainly in indoor areas.
4) Attacks via air

-  Bombing by airplanes makes it difficult for authorities to determine specific targets of the attack, which
underlines the need for authorities to issue an instruction for outdoor evacuation in wide areas.

**Chapter 3 Establishment of Implementation Posture**
(1) The state, local governments and designated state-run public institutions are to establish a posture to
implement civil protection measures in an appropriate and expeditious manner, including allocating
clerical works to be assigned to divisions and bureaus of these parties and posting of employees of these
parties for specific works under civil protection plans. The state and local governments are to take
measures to foster human resources, including improving educational and training courses.
Local governments are to improve a system to implement civil protection measures while utilizing
existing systems for disaster prevention. Prefectural governments, in particular, should strive to establish a
posture in which their employees stand by around the clock so that they can respond the moment after the
outbreak of an emergency situation, as well as establishing a disaster-prevention system. Municipalities
should strive to strengthen an employee stand-by system in cooperation with local firefighters’ groups
formed on a permanent basis.
(2) A special task force of the state and task forces of local governments are to promote cooperation in order
to implement civil protection measures in a perfect manner.
The Prime Minister is to set up a special task force in an area concerned, when taking response
measures in the local area is deemed necessary. The local task force is to fully take charge of liaison and
coordination with a special task force created at a concerned prefectural government.

**Chapter 4 Items Concerning Measures for Protecting of Civilians**

**1. Measures Concerning Evacuation of Residents**
(1) A warning relating to the situation of armed attacks, a forecast on armed attacks and areas expected to
come under imminent armed attacks is to be issued in document written as easily as possible and as
compactly as possible. Such warning is to be notified to residents via public communications networks
such as comprehensive administrative networks and regional satellite communications networks as well as
disaster-prevention wireless radio networks operated by local municipalities. Sirens are to be used in
principle so as to ensure that the warning can reach areas where armed attacks are deemed to be imminent
or armed attacks are deemed as having occurred.
Municipalities are to ensure that the warning has reached all of households covered by the
municipalities in cooperation with voluntarily formed disaster-prevention organizations and neighborhood
associations. Special consideration is to be given so that aged people and handicapped people can be
informed of the warning.
As broadcasting operators, designated public institutions are to broadcast the warning so as to convey
the warning’s content to households.
(2) The task force chief is to instruct the governor of a concerned prefecture to take evacuation measures
when evacuation of residents from specified areas is deemed necessary after situations surrounding the
emergency are examined in a comprehensive manner.
When the instruction of evacuation measures becomes necessary beyond a certain prefecture, the task
force chief is to instruct the state to take evacuation measures as the state’s policy after hearing views and
opinions from affected prefectures.
(3) Following are points to be considered in the event of evacuation.

-  In view of the fact that having a large number of residents in big cities evacuate to remote areas quickly
during a short period of time is extremely difficult, governors of prefectures should strive to get
information about available evacuation facilities and designate facilities that can sufficiently
accommodate such residents while the task force chief should basically instruct affected residents to
immediately evacuate to indoor facilities in their neighborhood, before issuing other instructions in
response to new developments later.

-  On the evacuation of people living in isolated islands, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport
is to provide necessary support by examining the availability of airplanes to be used in the event of an
emergency, so as to smoothly airlift affected people in response to requests by concerned local
governments.

-  On the evacuation of people living in the neighborhood of nuclear power plants, the task force chief is to
instruct adequate evacuation measures in response to developments in the situation.

-  On the evacuation of people living in the neighborhood of SDF facilities and U.S. military facilities, the
state and local governments are to keep close cooperation even during peacetime in order to ensure the
use of evacuation facilities, evacuation routes and means to transport evacuees. The state is also to
implement necessary coordination with local governments so that the governments can take measures to
evacuate local residents in the event of armed attacks.

-  On the evacuation of people living on peninsulas, mountainous areas and in the neighborhood of nuclear
power plants, governors of concerned prefectures, when issuing evacuation instructions, can recommend
the use of self-owned vehicles as transportation means for evacuation after taking into consideration
traffic situations of the regions.


-----

-  In cooperation with local governments, the state is to clarify points to be taken into account by Civilians
in the event of evacuation and to disseminate these points to the people, depending upon types of armed
attacks including those by ballistic missiles.

-  It is necessary to avoid guiding people to evacuate leeward in the event of armed attacks by nuclear,
biological and chemical weapons, and is important to have them put on hats and masks in evacuation to
help reduce the skin’s exposure to the contaminated air as much as possible. When human bodies are
seen to be contaminated by radioactive iodine in the wake of nuclear weapons attacks, affected people
are to be instructed to take agents to neutralize such iodine. When attacks by biological and chemical
weapons are launched, affected people are to be instructed to leave the attacked areas or the sites
immediately and evacuate to indoor rooms that are highly shielded against the air outside.
(4) Governors of prefectures who have received evacuation instructions are to instruct affected people to
evacuate immediately via mayors of municipalities. The governors are then to show major evacuation
routes such as national roads and local roads, and cite available transportation means for evacuation such
as railways and buses, after examining geographical features of each region. Local governments are to
keep close contact with designated public transportation operators to ensure means to transport evacuees.
Mayors of municipalities are to have residents informed of the evacuation instruction, using disasterprevention wireless radio networks operated by the municipalities and public relations vehicles.
As broadcasting operators, designated public institutions are to broadcast information on the
evacuation instruction in a prompt, accurate and compact manner.
(5) When an instruction of evacuation is issued, mayors of municipalities are to devise evacuationimplementation measures in line with the civil protection plan and evacuation guidelines prepared in
advance, and to guide people to safe places.
In order to adequately evacuate aged people and handicapped people, the mayors are to request those
who run facilities that house such people to implement measures for their smooth evacuation in line with
measures that would be taken in the case of fires and earthquakes.
If response measures by employees of the municipalities and local fire-fighting agencies alone are
deemed to be insufficient, police officers, Japan Coast Guard officers or SDF officers are to be mobilized
to smoothly evacuate affected people.

**2. Measures Concerning Relief of Evacuees**
(1) Following the receipt of an instruction by the task force chief to give relief to evacuated people, governors
of prefectures are to conduct relief operations that are deemed necessary, including provision of
accommodation facilities, supplies of food stuffs and provision of money to buy daily necessities. The
governors are to conduct these relief operations without receiving a relief instruction by the task force
chief, if such operations are deemed to be necessary immediately. Special considerations are to be given in
order to provide an adequate relief to aged people and handicapped people.
(2) Prefectural governments are to establish shelters and manage these facilities in an adequate manner by
ensuring to keep the evacuees’ health conditions sound and maintain their privacy in the shelters.
Prefectural governments are, even during peacetime, to establish methods to supply and procure food,
water and sleeping gear to be used in the event of armed attacks in line with methods that would be
employed in the case of natural disasters.
The state is to supply pharmaceuticals, food stuffs, daily necessities and fuel, when necessary or in line
with support requests from governors of concerned prefectures. The state is also to ensure ways to supply
such goods in cooperation with concerned industrial organizations. The state is to give special
consideration to ensuring ways to supply food stuffs and daily necessities to people in isolated islands.


-----

If necessary, concerned prefectures are to open emergency medical facilities in cases where a large number
of citizens sustained injuries as a result of large-scale armed attacks against Japan. The prefectures are also to
set up medical squads and dispatch qualified people to the squads. The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare
and other ministries are to secure medical doctors and form their own medial teams, if necessary. The Defense
Agency is to dispatch hygiene units to affected areas in response to requests from governors of concerned
prefectures or the head of a special task force.
(3) When a disaster stemming from an armed attack occurs, the state and prefectures will utilize medical
supplies and medical equipment that have been stockpiled so that they could be used in the event of armed
attacks by nuclear, biological and chemical weapons.
(4) On medical activities in the event of armed attacks by nuclear, biological and chemical weapons, the
Prime Minister is to instruct concerned Cabinet ministers to take necessary measures, including dispatch
of emergency medical teams, and provision of medical supplies and medical equipment, in cooperation
with concerned prefectural governments. In the event of attacks by biological weapons, medical services
operators are to take necessary protection measures, including vaccination, to provide medical treatment to
the victims and prevent the spread of the biological agents used in the attacks to other areas. In the event
of attacks by chemical weapons, medical services operators are to take necessary measures, including
neutralizing the contamination of the chemical agents used in the attacks as fast as possible.
(5) On activities to collect information on the safety of citizens and provision of such information to other
parties, consideration is to be given to the protection of personal information and freedom of press.
Heads of local governments are to collect and sort out information on the safety of citizens, including
evacuees and people who have been admitted to hospital. Other administrative organizations are to help
heads of local governments in collecting information on safety of citizens.
Upon receiving inquiries on the safety of citizens, the Minister of Internal Affairs and
Communications or heads of local governments are to provide information on such safety unless the
inquiries are deemed as being done for unduly purposes.
Designated administrative agencies, designated public institutions and other relevant organizations are
to try to cooperate with heads of local governments in collecting information on the safety of citizens.
The Minister of Internal Affairs and Communications and heads of local governments are to cooperate
with the Red Cross Society of Japan in collecting and sorting out information on the safety of foreign
people.

**3. Response Measures Concerning Disasters Caused by the Armed Attacks**
(1) On response measures concerning disasters caused by the armed attacks against Japan, the state is to take
necessary measures on its own while the head of a special task force is, if necessary, to immediately
instruct governors of prefectures to implement these measures after explaining an implementation policy
to the governors.
Governors of prefectures are to request the head of a special task force to take necessary measures,
including dispatches of firefighters, police officers, Maritime Safety Agency officers and SDF units, if
preventing disasters from armed attacks and reducing the damage from such attacks by relevant
prefectures alone are deemed difficult.
(2) If emergency measures to prevent danger of citizens are deemed necessary, governments of concerned
prefectures are to swiftly issue an emergency notice and, if necessary, take measures, including an
issuance of an evacuation instruction and designation of dangerous areas.
As broadcasting operators, designated public institutions are to broadcast information on the
emergency notice swiftly.


-----

(3) Government ministries and agencies having jurisdiction over certain livelihood-related facilities and
relevant prefectures should ensure to get information on these facilities during peacetime.
Government ministries and agencies having jurisdiction over certain livelihood-related facilities
should keep contact with the Fire and Disaster Management Agency, the National Police Agency and the
Maritime Safety Agency, and take note of special points to be considered to ensure the safety of each
facility according to the characteristics and feature of each.
When taking measures to ensure the safety of certain livelihood-related facilities and their surrounding
areas is deemed necessary, the Prime Minister is to instruct relevant Cabinet ministers to strengthen
security and take other measures including evacuation of citizens living in the areas, based on the
government’s basic response plan.
In the event of armed attacks being launched against Japan, governors of prefectures are to request
public safety commissions of the prefectures to swiftly designate livelihood-related facilities where people
are barred from entry. To be designated off-limit are facilities whose security, if not ensured, would cause
significant damage to the surrounding areas, such as dams, nuclear power plants and stations handling a
large amount of dangerous objects.
(4) Following points need to be considered as ways to ensure the security of nuclear power plants in addition
to taking measures which are usually meant to ensure the safety of a livelihood-related facility.

-  When the leakage of radioactive substances is reported or the leakage of such substances is warned, the
Prime Minister is to immediately set up a special local task force while ensuring safety in the affected
area. In principle, such a special task force is to be headquartered in an off-the-site area. The task force is
to organize a joint council with a concerned local government to work out measures against disasters
stemming from armed attacks on nuclear power plants. The joint council is to be led by the head of the
local task force.

-  In the event of armed attacks, nuclear power plant operators are to immediately take necessary measures
to halt the operation of nuclear power reactors. The Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry is to
immediately order nuclear power plant operators to stop the operation of nuclear reactors located in areas
covered by the warning. If a warning is issued without designating specific areas, the Minister of
Economy, Trade and Industry is to order suspension of operation for nuclear reactors whose suspension
is deemed necessary after the degree of danger and its specific content are examined. Nuclear power
plant operators are to stop the operation of their reactors on their own decision if the situation is
emergent. After relevant nuclear power reactors stop operating, the state and nuclear power plant
operators are to take necessary measures to ensure power supply.
(5) When disasters arise following armed attacks by nuclear, biological and chemical weapons, the Prime
Minister is, based on the basic response plan, to instruct relevant Cabinet ministers to swiftly collect
information, launch operations to rescue victims, promptly identify objects that have caused the disaster,
determine the contaminated area, and implement necessary measures to decontaminate the area and
prevent the spread of the contamination. If the situation is emergent, the Prime Minister is to ask for
cooperation from heads of concerned prefectures.
In response to these instructions by the Prime Minister and his request for cooperation from heads of
concerned prefectures, fire-fighting agencies, prefectural police authorities, the Maritime Safety Agency
and the SDF are to implement necessary response measures. These response measures are to be
implemented after necessary safety measures are taken, including the use of protection gear by those who
are to engage in actual rescue and other operations. In the event of attacks by biological agents, response
measures are to be taken after protection measures are implemented, including vaccination against the
agents.


-----

Information on the disaster is to be disseminated to citizens in order to prevent the citizens from going
panic. In the event of attacks by biological agents, information on vaccination is to be disseminated to
citizens while the Minster of Health, Labour and Welfare is to instruct governors of relevant prefectures to
have citizens vaccinated against the agents, if necessary.
The Governor of a concerned prefecture is to make coordination with governors of other prefectures
and police authorities of concerned prefectures before introducing measures including barring citizens
from entering certain buildings and imposing traffic restrictions.
When water used by citizens is contaminated as a result of attacks by nuclear, biological and chemical
weapons, the Minister of Health, Labour and Welfare or governors of prefectural governments are, if
necessary, to order water-supply parties to take measures, including limiting water supply.
(6) If fire-fighting, rescue and fast-aid activities are deemed necessary in response to disasters stemming from
armed attacks against Japan, the Commissioner of the Fire and Disaster Management Agency is to instruct
governors of concerned prefectures or mayors of concerned municipalities to ensure that these activities
can be conducted in an appropriate and expeditious manner.
If citizens are infected with biological agents used as weapons in armed attacks against Japan or they
are feared to be infected with such agents, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare is to designate the
infection from the chemical agent as a designated infection and, if necessary, take measures under the
Infectious Disease Law.
When a large amount of waste, such as rubble and debris, arises as a result of large-scale armed attacks
against Japan, the Environment Ministry is to promptly dispose of such waste under exceptional rules set
to govern waste disposal.
When protection of important cultural assets from possible damage following armed attacks is deemed
particularly necessary, the Commissioner of the Cultural Affairs Agency is to order or recommend owners
of the assets to take measures to change the assets’ storage places, and to provide necessary support to the
owners if they ask for such support.

**4. Points to be Considered Concerning Measures in General to Protect Civilians**
(1) Telecommunications carriers are to preferentially cater to important telecommunications needs by the
state, local governments and designated public institutions to implement measures for civil protection in
the wake of armed attacks against Japan.
(2) In consultation with designated public institutions that serve as transportation operators, the state and local
governments are to strive to ensure transportation of evacuees and emergency relief goods while taking
into consideration safety issues involved.
(3) In the event of armed attacks, police authorities of prefectural governments are to implement traffic
restriction measures on general vehicles, including their being barred from using certain roads, in order to
secure traffic routes for transporting evacuees and emergency relief goods.
(4) Concerned local governments, in cooperation with relevant organizations, are to try to improve systems to
receive emergency relief goods from the general public and business corporations, and to distribute these
goods to people needing them.
(5) The state is to set standards and procedures for issuing Red Cross and other special badges to be used in
emergency. Based on these standards and procedures, heads of designated administrative agencies and
others are to devise necessary guidelines for specifically issuing such badges.


-----

**5. Measures to Stabilize Civil Life**
(1) In order to stabilize Civil Life, the state and local governments are to take necessary measures, including
helping stabilize prices of daily necessities, imposing moratorium on debt repayments, stabilizing the
currency and monetary system, ensuring to offer school education and maintaining employment.
(2) Local governments are to take necessary measures to ensure that water can be supplied in a stable and
appropriate manner. Designated public institutions are to implement necessary measures to ensure that
electricity and gas can be supplied in a stable and appropriate manner, ensure that civil passengers and
cargo can be transported in an appropriate manner, ensure that telecommunications lines can be kept
through such measures as installing emergency circuit lines and to ensure that mail and correspondence
services can be maintained.
(3) The state, local governments and designated public institutions are to begin quick restoration work for
damaged facilities and equipment under their jurisdiction after ensuring to take safety measures involved
in the work.

**6. Measures Concerning Reconstruction after Disasters from Armed Attacks**
The state is to implement necessary measures for prompt restoration of facilities and services while examining
their damage from armed attacks. The Government is to promptly take necessary steps to establish a legal
framework to finance measures being implemented in the restoration work following armed attacks.

**7. Exercise and Stockpiling**
(1) The state and local governments should conduct practical training against armed attacks from foreign
countries and evaluate results of the training. Designated public institutions should independently engage
in training for civil protection while such institutions should encourage citizens to participate in training
courses sponsored by the state or local governments. Training mentioned above is to be conducted in
combination with disaster-prevention drills.
(2) The state, local governments and designated public institutions should ensure to get accurate information
about the amount of goods and materials being stockpiled against natural disasters, their specific kinds and
where these goods are to be supplied in disasters so that these goods and materials can be also used for
civil protection in the event of armed attacks against Japan.
The state should try to secure goods and materials that would become necessary in the event of armed
attacks by nuclear, biological and chemical weapons, such as protective garment to be worn against
chemical weapons, and special medicines to neutralize chemical agents, and also should try to improve a
system to procure these goods and materials.
Local governments should establish a system to enable stockpiled anti-disaster goods and materials to
be utilized in the event of armed attacks against Japan, and also should strive to establish a system to
procure and stockpile goods and materials that would become particularly necessary in the event of such
armed attacks.

**Chapter 5 Responses to Emergency Response Situations**
(1) Measures almost equal to civil protection measures that would be taken in the case of armed attacks
against Japan are to be implemented in the event of terrorist attacks against the country, which are seen as
roughly equal to armed attacks. Therefore, the state of being attacked by terrorists is categorized as a
situation that requires emergency response action, leading the Government to take emergency response
protection measures. Following are situations that require emergency response action by the Government.


-----

1) A situation in which an attack is launched against facilities containing inherently dangerous
substances
(destruction of nuclear power plants and explosion of petrochemical complex facilities)
2) A situation in which an attack is launched against facilities accommodating a large number of people
and against public transportation systems
(explosion of terminal stations and railways)
3) A situation in which an attack is launched using substances that are capable of injuring and killing a
large number of people
(indiscriminate sprinkling of anthrax and sarin)
4) A situation in which an attack is launched using transportation systems as a way to destroy targets
(suicidal terrorist attacks using civil airplanes)
(2) When a special headquarters is set up to deal with situations requiring emergency response action, the
state, led by the headquarters, is to do its utmost to implement emergency response protection measures in
cooperation with local governments and designated public institutions.
The Prime Minister is to establish a special task force in a certain local area if setting up such a task
force there is deemed necessary. The local task force is to fully take charge of liaison and coordination
with a prefectural task force.
(3) Emergency response protection measures are to be taken basically in line with basic policies and civilprotection steps stipulated under Chapter 1 to Chapter 4 of the basic guidelines.
The notification of warning and the scope of areas subject to such notification in the case of situations
requiring emergency response measures are to be determined by the task force chief after the degree of the
damage by the attack and the scope of geographical areas impacted by the attack are examined.

**Chapter 6 Procedures for Planning for Concerning Civil Protection**
Civil protection plan undertaken by designated administrative institutions and prefectures, and civil protection
plan undertaken by designated public institutions are to be devised or revised after views and opinions from
wider quarters of society are heard. Designated public institutions are to ensure opportunities for hearing
opinions from those who are engaging in work to devise civil protection plans.

**Reference 34. Highlights of the Civil Protection Plan of the Ministry of Defense and**
**Defense Facilities Administration Agency**

Civil Protection Plans are prepared by all designated administrative agencies based on provisions including
Article 33 Paragraph 1 of the Civil Protection Law.

**1. Basic Concept**

of personnel, inspection and maintenance of equipment and supplies, etc.).

**3. Implementation Procedures for Civil Protection Measures**
a. If the Defense Minster is requested by a prefectural governor and recognizes it is unavoidable, or is
requested by the Task Force Chief, the Minister of State for Defense, with the approval of the Prime
Minister, orders a civilian protection dispatch to implement civil protection measures.
b. If the Minster of State for Defense is requested for support by a prefectural governor and recognizes it is
required, the Defense Minister orders defense operations/public security operations to all or part of the forces
to implement civil protection measures.

**4. Contents of Civil Protection Measures Executed by the SDF**
a. Evacuation of residents
The SDF, in coordination with related organizations, implements guidance and transportation of evacuated
residents, as well as collection and provision of necessary information. In addition, it coordinates and
manages procedures associated with traffic inside the SDF’s posts and bases or on the premises of American
military installations in Japan, for the purpose of evacuation.
b. Relief of evacuated residents
The SDF implements lifesaving measures (such as search and rescue, and provision of first aid), and as
appropriate, measures for livelihood support (such as preparation of hot meals, water supply, and
transportation of aid supplies). In addition, it gives permission to use facilities of the Ministry of Defense for
the purpose of relief.
c. Responses to armed attack disasters
The SDF checks on the damage situation (including monitoring support), saves lives (including search and
rescue, and provision of first aid), prevents the spread of damage (including evacuation support of
surrounding residents, and fire fighting), removes hazardous substances caused by attacks using NBC
weapons, etc. In addition, it implements support for securing safety of life-related facilities (including
instruction/advice, and personnel dispatch).

**5. Responses to Emergency Response Situations**
The SDF implements protection measures for emergency responses pursuant to the measures for civil
protection in implementation procedures and content.

**Reference 35. Japan-U.S. Joint Declaration on Security: Alliance for the 21st Century**

(Tokyo, April 17, 1996)

1. Today, the Prime Minister and the President celebrated one of the most successful bilateral relationships in
history. The leaders took pride in the profound and positive contribution this relationship has made to
world peace and regional stability and prosperity. The strong Alliance between Japan and the U.S. helped
ensure peace and security in the Asia-Pacific region during the Cold War. Our Alliance continues to
underlie the dynamic economic growth in this region. The two leaders agreed that the future security and
prosperity of both Japan and the U.S. are tied inextricably to the future of the Asia-Pacific region.
The benefits of peace and prosperity that spring from the Alliance are due not only to the
commitments of the two Governments, but also to the contributions of the Japanese and American people


-----

who have shared the burden of securing freedom and democracy. The Prime Minister and the President
expressed their profound gratitude to those who sustain the Alliance, especially those Japanese
communities that host U.S. forces, and those Americans who, far from home, devote themselves to the
defense of peace and freedom.
2. For more than a year, the two Governments conducted an intensive review of the evolving political and
security environment of the Asia-Pacific region and of various aspects of the Japan-U.S. security
relationship. On the basis of this review, the Prime Minister and the President reaffirmed their
commitment to the profound common values that guide our national policies: the maintenance of freedom,
the pursuit of democracy and respect for human rights. They agreed that the foundations for our
cooperation remain firm, and that this partnership will remain vital in the twenty-first century.

**The Regional Outlook**
3. Since the end of the Cold War, the possibility of global armed conflict has receded. The last few years
have seen expanded political and security dialogue among countries of the region. Respect for democratic
principles is growing. Prosperity is more widespread than at any other time in history, and we are
witnessing the emergence of an Asia-Pacific community. The Asia-Pacific region has become the most
dynamic area of the grobe.
At the same time, instability and uncertainty persist in the region. Tensions continue on the Korean
Peninsula. There are still heavy concentrations of military force, including nuclear arsenals. Unresolved
territorial disputes, potential regional conflicts, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and
their means of delivery all constitute source of instability.

**The Japan-U.S. Alliance and the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security**
4. The Prime Minister and the President underscored the importance of promoting stability in this region and
dealing with the security challenges facing both countries.
In this regard, the Prime Minister and the President reiterated the significant value of the Alliance
between Japan and the U.S. They reaffirmed that the Japan-U.S. security relationship, based on the Treaty
of Mutual Cooperation and Security between Japan and the United States of America, remains the
cornerstone for achieving common security objectives, and for maintaining a stable and prosperous
environment for the Asia-Pacific region as we enter the twenty-first century.
(a) The Prime Minister confirmed Japan’s fundamental defense policy as articulated in its new National
Defense Program Outline adopted in November 1995, which underscored that the Japanese defense
capabilities should play appropriate roles in the security environment after the Cold War. The Prime
Minister and the President agreed that the most effective framework for the defense of Japan is close
defense cooperation between the two countries. This cooperation is based on a combination of
appropriate defense capabilities for the Self-Defense Forces (SDF) of Japan and the Japan-U.S.
Security Arrangements. The leaders again confirmed that U.S. deterrence under the Treaty of Mutual
Cooperation and Security remains the guarantee for Japan’s security.
(b) The Prime Minister and the President agreed that continued U.S. military presence is also essential for
preserving peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region. The leaders shared the common recognition
that the Japan-U.S. security relationship forms an essential pillar which supports the positive regional
engagement of the U.S.
The President emphasized the U.S. commitment to the defense of Japan as well as to peace and
stability in the Asia-Pacific region. He noted that there has been some adjustment of U.S. forces in the
Asia-Pacific region since the end of the Cold War. On the basis of a thorough assessment, the U.S.


-----

reaffirmed that meeting its commitments in the prevailing security environment requires the
maintenance of its current force structure of about 100,000 forward deployed military personnel in the
region, including about the current level in Japan.
(c) The Prime Minister welcomed the U.S. determination to remain a stable and steadfast presence in the
region. He reconfirmed that Japan would continue appropriate contributions for the maintenance of
U.S. Forces Japan, such as through the provision of facilities and areas in accordance with the Treaty
of Mutual Cooperation and Security and Host Nation Support. The President expressed U.S.
appreciation for japan’s contributions, and welcomed the conclusion of the new Special Measures
Agreement which provides financial support for U.S. forces stationed in Japan.

**Bilateral Cooperation under the Japan-U.S. Security Relationship**
5. The Prime Minister and the President, with the objective of enhancing the credibility of this vital security
relationship, agreed to undertake efforts to advance cooperation in the following areas.
(a) Recognizing that close bilateral defense cooperation is a central element of the Japan-U.S. Alliance,
both Governments agreed that continued close consultation is essential. Both Governments will
further enhance the exchange of information and views on the international situation, in particular the
Asia-Pacific region. At the same time, in response to the changes which may arise in the international
security environment, both Governments will continue to consult closely on defense policies and
military postures, including the U.S. force structure in Japan, which will best meet their requirements.
(b) The Prime Minister and the President agreed to initiate a review of the 1978 Guidelines for JapanU.S. Defense Cooperation to build upon the close working relationship already established between
Japan and the U.S..
The two leaders agreed on the necessity to promote bilateral policy coordination, including
studies on bilateral cooperation in dealing with situations that may emerge in the areas surrounding
Japan and which will have an important influence on the peace and security of Japan.
(c) The Prime Minister and the President welcomed the April 15, 1996 signature of the Agreement
Between the Government of Japan and the Government of the United States of America Concerning
Reciprocal Provision of Logistic Support, Supplies and Services Between the SDF of Japan and the
Armed Forces of the United States of America, and expressed their hope that this Agreement will
further promote the bilateral cooperative relationship.
(d) Nothing the importance of interoperability in all facets of cooperation between the SDF of Japan and
the U.S. forces, the two Governments will enhance mutual exchange in the areas of technology and
equipment, including bilateral cooperative research and development of equipment such as the fighter
support (F-2).
(e) The two Governments recognized that the proliferation of weapons for mass destruction and their
means of delivery has important implications for their common security. They will work together to
prevent proliferation and will continue to cooperate in the ongoing study on ballistic missile defense.
6. The Prime Minister and the President recognized that the broad support and understanding of the Japanese
people are indispensable for the smooth stationing of U.S. Forces Japan, which is the core element of the
Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements. The two leaders agreed that both governments will make every effort
to deal with various issues related to the presence and status of U.S. forces. They also agreed to make
further efforts to enhance mutual understanding between U.S. forces and local Japanese communities.
In particular, with respect to Okinawa, where U.S. facilities and areas are highly concentrated, the
Prime Minister and the President reconfirmed their determination to carry out steps to consolidate, realign,
and reduce U.S. facilities and areas consistent with the objectives of the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and


-----

Security. In this respect, the two leaders took satisfaction in the significant progress which has been made
so far through the Special Action Committee on Okinawa (SACO), and welcomed the far-reaching
measures outlined in the SACO Interim Report of April 15, 1996. They expressed their firm commitment
to achieve a successful conclusion of the SACO process by November 1996.

**Regional Cooperation**
7. The Prime Minister and the President agreed that the two Governments will jointly and individually strive
to achieve a more peaceful and stable security environment in the Asia-Pacific region. In this regard, the
two leaders recognized that the engagement of the U.S. in the region, supported by the Japan-U.S. security
relationship, constitutes the foundation for such efforts.
The two leaders stressed the importance of peaceful resolution of problems in the region. They
emphasized that it is extremely important for the stability and prosperity of the region that China play a
positive and constructive role, and, in this context, stressed the interest of both countries in furthering
cooperation with China. Russia’s ongoing process of reform contributes to regional and global stability,
and merits continued encouragement and cooperation. The leaders also stated that full normalization of
Japan-Russia relations based on the Tokyo Declaration is important to peace and stability in the AsiaPacific region. They noted also that stability on the Korean Peninsula is vitally important to Japan and the
U.S. and reaffirmed that both countries will continue to make every effort in this regard, in close
cooperation with the Republic of Korea.
The Prime Minister and the President reaffirmed that the two Governments will continue working
jointly and with other countries in the region to further develop multilateral regional security dialogues
and cooperation mechanisms such as the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), and eventually, security
dialogues regarding Northeast Asia.

**Global Cooperation**
8. The Prime Minister and the President recognized that the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security is the
core of the Japan-U.S. Alliance, and underlies the mutual confidence that constitutes the foundation for
bilateral cooperation on global issues.
The Prime Minister and the President agreed that the two governments will strengthen their
cooperation in support of the U.N. and other international organizations through activities such as
peacekeeping and humanitarian relief operations.
Both Governments will coordinate their policies and cooperate on issues such as arms control and
disarmament, including acceleration of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) negotiations and the
prevention of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery. The two
leaders agreed that cooperation in the U.N. and APEC, and on issues such as the North Korean nuclear
problem, the Middle East peace process, and the peace implementation process in the former Yugoslavia,
helps to build the kind of world that promotes our shared interests and values.

**Conclusion**
9. In concluding, the Prime Minister and the President agreed that the three legs of the Japan-U.S.
relationship—security, political, and economic—are based on shared values and interests and rest on the
mutual confidence embodied in the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security. The Prime Minister and
the President reaffirmed their strong determination, on the eve of the twenty-first century, to build on the
successful history of security cooperation and to work hand-in-hand to secure peace and prosperity for

introduce ballistic missile defense systems and its recent announcement on its Three Principles on Arms
Export, the Ministers reaffirmed their commitment to close cooperation on policy and operational matters
and to advancing U.S.-Japan cooperative research in BMD systems, with a view to possible cooperative
development.

**Common Strategic Objectives**
6. The Ministers discussed the new security environment in which new and emerging threats, such as
international terrorism and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and their means of
delivery, have surfaced as common challenges. They recognized that deepening interdependence among
nations in a global community means that such threats can affect the security of nations worldwide,
including the United States and Japan.
7. While noting that these threats are also emerging in the Asia-Pacific region, the Ministers also emphasized
that persistent challenges continue to create unpredictability and uncertainty. Moreover, they noted that
modernization of military capabilities in the region also requires attention.
8. The Ministers strongly urged North Korea to return to the Six-Party Talks expeditiously and without
preconditions, and to commit itself to complete dismantlement of all its nuclear programs in a transparent
manner subject to verification.


-----

9. Based on this understanding of the international security environment, the Ministers concurred that both
Governments need to work closely together to pursue common strategic objectives through their
respective efforts, implementation of the U.S.-Japan security arrangements, and other joint efforts based

**Strengthening of U.S.-Japan Security and Defense Cooperation**
12. The Ministers expressed their support and appreciation for each other’s efforts to develop their respective
security and defense policies. Japan’s new National Defense Program Guidelines (NDPG) emphasize
Japan’s capability to respond effectively to new threats and diverse contingencies, Japan’s active
engagement to improve the international security environment, and the importance of the Japan-U.S.
Alliance. As a central component of its broad defense transformation effort, the United States is
reorienting and strengthening its global defense posture to provide it with appropriate, strategy-driven
capabilities in an uncertain security environment. The Ministers confirmed that these efforts will ensure


-----

and strengthen effective security and defense cooperation as both countries pursue common strategic
objectives.
13. In this context, the Ministers underscored the need to continue examining the roles, missions, and
capabilities of Japan’s Self Defense Forces and the U.S. Armed Forces required to respond effectively to
diverse challenges in a well-coordinated manner. This examination will take into account recent

in Japan while reducing the burden on local communities, including those in Okinawa. The Ministers
directed their staffs to report expeditiously on the results of these consultations.
15. The Ministers also stressed the importance of continued efforts to enhance positive relations between local
communities and U.S. forces. They emphasized that improved implementation of the Status of Forces
Agreement (SOFA), including due attention to the environment, and steady implementation of the Special
Action Committee on Okinawa (SACO) Final Report are important to the stable presence of U.S. forces in
Japan.
16. The Ministers, noting that the current Special Measures Agreement (SMA) will expire in March 2006,
decided to start consultations on future arrangements to provide appropriate levels of host nation support,
bearing in mind the significant role of the SMA in supporting the presence of U.S. forces in Japan.

**Reference 37 U.S.-Japan Alliance: Transformation and Realignment for the Future**

(Washington DC, October 29, 2005)

**I. Overview**
The U.S.-Japan Alliance, with the U.S.-Japan security arrangements at its core, is the indispensable foundation
of Japan’s security and of peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region. A close, cooperative relationship based
on the alliance also plays an important role in effectively dealing with global challenges, and must evolve to
reflect the changing security environment. Therefore, following the December 2002 meeting of the Security
Consultative Committee (SCC), the U.S. and Japan intensified consultations on respective U.S. and Japanese
security and defense policies in order to examine the direction of the U.S.-Japan alliance, and to develop
options to adapt the alliance to the changing regional and global security environment.
At the February 19, 2005 meeting of the SCC, the Ministers reached an understanding on common strategic
objectives, and underscored the need to continue examinations of the roles, missions, and capabilities of
Japan’s Self-Defense Forces (SDF) and the U.S. Armed Forces in pursuing those objectives. They also decided
to intensify their consultations on realignment of U.S. force structure in Japan and directed their staffs to report
expeditiously on the results.
Today, the SCC members reaffirmed their shared view of the security environment, in which new and
emerging threats have surfaced as common challenges that can affect the security of nations worldwide,
including the U.S. and Japan. They also reemphasized the persistent challenges in the Asia-Pacific region that
create unpredictability and uncertainty and underscored the need to pay attention to modernization of military
capabilities in the region. In this context, both sides reiterated their commitment to work closely together to


-----

pursue the regional and global common strategic objectives identified in their February 19, 2005 Joint
Statement.
The SCC members approved findings and recommendations on roles, missions, and capabilities. They also
approved recommendations for realignment, as reflected in this report. These measures are designed to enhance
the alliance’s capability to meet new threats and diverse contingencies and, as a whole, will reduce burdens on
local communities, thereby strengthening security and ensuring the alliance remains the anchor of regional
stability.

**II. Roles, Missions, and Capabilities**
Both sides recognized recent achievements and developments in security and defense policies related to the
roles, missions, and capabilities of the U.S. and Japan, to include: bilateral cooperation in international
activities such as the fight against terrorism, the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI), assistance to Iraq, and
disaster relief following the tsunami in the Indian Ocean and the earthquake in South Asia; Japan’s December
2004 National Defense Program Guidelines; progress in ballistic missile defense (BMD) cooperation; Japan’s
legislation to deal with contingencies; the SDF’s planned transition to a new joint operations posture; and the
transformation and global posture realignment of U.S. forces.
1. Primary Areas
In this context, the U.S. and Japan examined bilateral roles, missions, and capabilities, particularly those of the
U.S. forces and the SDF, for responding to diverse challenges in the contemporary security environment,
placing primary emphasis on the following two areas:
— Defense of Japan and responses to situations in areas surrounding Japan, including responses to new
threats and diverse contingencies;
— Efforts to improve the international security environment, such as participation in international peace
cooperation activities.
2. Basic Concepts of Roles, Missions, and Capabilities
Both sides confirmed several basic concepts relevant to bilateral defense cooperation. Related to defense of
Japan and responses to situations in areas surrounding Japan, these concepts include:

-  Bilateral defense cooperation remains vital to the security of Japan as well as to peace and stability of the
region.

-  Japan will defend itself and respond to situations in areas surrounding Japan, including addressing new
threats and diverse contingencies such as ballistic missile attacks, attacks by guerilla and special forces, and
invasion of remote islands. For these purposes, Japan’s defense posture will be strengthened in accordance
with the 2004 National Defense Program Guidelines.

-  The U.S. will maintain forward-deployed forces, and augment them as needed, for the defense of Japan as
well as to deter and respond to situations in areas surrounding Japan. The U.S. will provide all necessary
support for the defense of Japan.

-  U.S. and Japanese operations in the defense of Japan and responses to situations in areas surrounding Japan
must be consistent so that appropriate responses will be ensured when a situation in areas surrounding Japan
threatens to develop into an armed attack against Japan or when such a situation and an armed attack against
Japan occur simultaneously.

-  Japan will continue to provide host nation support including facilities and areas for U.S. forces (hereafter
referred to as “U.S. facilities and areas”). Japan will also take appropriate measures to provide seamless
support to U.S. operations as the situation evolves, including support based on Japan’s legislation to deal
with contingencies. Both sides will work with local communities to ensure stable support for the presence
and operations of U.S. forces in Japan.


-----

-  U.S. strike capabilities and the nuclear deterrence provided by the U.S. remain an essential complement to
Japan’s defense capabilities in ensuring the defense of Japan and contribute to peace and security in the
region.
Both sides also confirmed several basic concepts relevant to roles, missions, and capabilities in the area
of improving the international security environment, to include:

-  Bilateral cooperation in improving the international security environment to achieve regional and global
common strategic objectives has become an important element of the alliance. To this end, the U.S. and
Japan contribute as appropriate based on their respective capabilities, and take necessary measures to
establish effective posture.

-  Rapid and effective response requires flexible capabilities and can benefit from close U.S.-Japan bilateral
cooperation and policy coordination. Regular exercises, including those with third countries, can improve
these capabilities.

-  The U.S. forces and the SDF will strengthen cooperation with other partners to contribute to international
activities to improve the international security environment.
In addition, both sides emphasized that the increasing importance of addressing new threats and diverse
contingencies and improving the international security environment compels both sides to develop their
respective defense capabilities, and to maximize the benefits of innovations in technology.
3. Examples of Operations in Bilateral Security and Defense Cooperation to be Improved
Both sides reconfirmed that the entire spectrum of bilateral cooperation must be strengthened, consistent with
relevant national security policies and laws, and with agreements between the U.S. and Japan. Through their
examination of roles, missions, and capabilities, they emphasized the importance of improving several specific
areas of cooperation:

-  Air defense.

-  Ballistic missile defense.

-  Counter-proliferation operations, such as the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI).

-  Counter-terrorism.

-  Minesweeping, maritime interdiction, and other operations to maintain the security of maritime traffic.

-  Search and rescue operations.

-  Intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) operations, including increasing capabilities and
effectiveness of operations by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and maritime patrol aircraft.

-  Humanitarian relief operations.

-  Reconstruction assistance operations.

-  Peacekeeping operations and capacity building for other nations’ peacekeeping efforts.

-  Protection of critical infrastructure, including U.S. facilities and areas in Japan.

-  Response to attacks by weapons of mass destruction (WMD), including disposal and decontamination of
WMD.

-  Mutual logistics support activities such as supply, maintenance, and transportation. Supply cooperation
includes mutual provision of aerial and maritime refueling. Transportation cooperation includes expanding
and sharing airlift and sealift, including the capability provided by high speed vessels (HSV).

-  Transportation, use of facilities, medical support, and other related activities for non-combatant evacuation
operations (NEO).

-  Use of seaport and airport facilities, road, water space and airspace, and frequency bands.
Both sides emphasized that other areas of operations not explicitly listed above remain important to alliance
capabilities; this list highlights key areas for further enhancement but is not intended to be an exhaustive list
of possible areas of cooperation.


-----

4. Essential Steps to Strengthen Posture for Bilateral Security and Defense Cooperation
Based on the examination of roles, missions, and capabilities described above, both sides further identified the
following essential steps that can be taken in peacetime to strengthen the posture of bilateral security and
defense cooperation to deal with diverse challenges in the new security environment. Both sides also
emphasized the importance of continuing examinations of roles, missions, and capabilities, based on the
progress made thus far, to ensure effective bilateral cooperation.

-  Close and Continuous Policy and Operational Coordination.
Both sides recognized that regular policy and operational coordination will improve the alliance’s timely and
effective response to future changes in the strategic environment and to contingencies. Close and continuous
policy and operational coordination at every level of government, from unit tactical level through strategic
consultations, is essential to dissuade destabilizing military build-ups, to deter aggression, and to respond to
diverse security challenges. Development of a common operational picture shared between U.S. forces and
the SDF will strengthen operational coordination and should be pursued where possible. Closer cooperation
between defense and other pertinent authorities is also increasingly necessary. In this context, both sides
reaffirmed the need to improve the effectiveness of the comprehensive mechanism and bilateral coordination
mechanism under the 1997 Guidelines for U.S.-Japan Defense Cooperation by streamlining their functions.

-  Advancing Bilateral Contingency Planning.
Recalling that the 1997 Guidelines for U.S.-Japan Defense Cooperation provide a basis for bilateral defense
planning and mutual cooperation planning, both sides affirmed the continual requirement for such planning
while taking full account of the changing security environment. This planning will reflect Japan’s legislation
to deal with contingencies, which provides a strengthened basis for contingency use by U.S. forces and the
SDF of facilities, including airports and seaports, in Japan. Both sides will expand their planning by adding
specificity, coordinating closely with relevant government agencies and local authorities, enhancing bilateral
mechanisms and planning methods, conducting detailed surveys of civilian and SDF air and seaports, and
validating their planning work through strengthened bilateral exercise programs.

-  Enhancing Information Sharing and Intelligence Cooperation.
Recognizing that common situational awareness is a key to well coordinated cooperation, both sides will
enhance information sharing and intelligence cooperation in the whole range from unit tactical level through
national strategic level. To facilitate this interaction, both sides will take additional necessary measures to
protect shared classified information so that broader information sharing is promoted among pertinent
authorities.

-  Improving Interoperability.
To ensure smooth cooperation as the SDF transitions to a joint operations posture, U.S. forces and the SDF
will maintain regular consultations to maintain and strengthen interoperability. Continued cooperation in
planning for bilateral operations and exercises will strengthen connectivity between the headquarters of U.S.
forces and the SDF and will benefit from improved secure communications capabilities.

-  Expanding Training Opportunities in Japan and the United States.
Both sides will expand opportunities for bilateral training and exercises to improve interoperability, improve
capabilities, enhance readiness, more equitably distribute training impacts among local communities, and
advance the effectiveness of bilateral operations. These measures will include increasing mutual use of U.S.
and SDF training facilities and areas throughout Japan. The training of SDF personnel and units in Guam,
Alaska, Hawaii, and the U.S. mainland will also be expanded.

❍ In particular, the U.S. plan to expand its training infrastructure in Guam will provide increased training
opportunities for the SDF in Guam.


-----

❍ Additionally, both sides recognized that U.S. forces and SDF participation in multinational training and
exercises will enhance their contribution to a better international security environment.

-  Shared Use of Facilities by U.S. Forces and the SDF.
Both sides recognized that shared-use of facilities between U.S. forces and the SDF contributes to closer
bilateral operational coordination and improved interoperability. Specific opportunities for shared use of
facilities are described in the force posture realignment recommendations (see section below).

-  Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD).
Emphasizing that BMD plays a critical role in deterring and defending against ballistic missile attacks, and
can dissuade other parties from development and proliferation of ballistic missiles, both sides stressed the
value of closely coordinating improvements in their respective BMD capabilities. To support these BMD
systems, they emphasized the critical importance of constant information gathering and sharing, as well as
maintaining high readiness and interoperability in light of the minimal time available to respond to a ballistic
missile threat. The U.S. will deploy additional complementary capabilities in and around Japan when
appropriate, coordinating their operations to support Japan’s missile defense operations. Close coordination
between respective BMD command and control systems will be critical to effective missile defense
operations.
Both sides committed to strengthen and improve the effectiveness of bilateral cooperation under the
1997 Guidelines for U.S.-Japan Defense Cooperation and, as appropriate, in additional areas not currently
addressed by the Guidelines.

**III. Force Posture Realignment**
Both sides reviewed the posture of U.S. forces in Japan and related SDF forces, in light of their shared
commitment to maintain deterrence and capabilities while reducing burdens on local communities, including
those in Okinawa. Both sides recognized the importance of enhancing Japanese and U.S. public support for the
security alliance, which contributes to sustainable presence of U.S. forces at facilities and areas in Japan.
1. Guiding Precepts
In their review, taking full account of the examination of bilateral roles, missions, and capabilities, both sides
established several precepts to guide force posture realignments in Japan.

-  The U.S. military presence in the Asia-Pacific region is a core capability that is indispensable to regional
peace and security and critical to both the U.S. and Japan. Japan contributes capabilities that are additional
and complementary to those provided by the U.S. forces, while taking the leading role of providing for its
own defense. The presence of U.S. forces and the SDF must evolve as the regional and global security
environment changes and as both sides assess alliance roles and missions.

-  Capabilities will be strengthened through realignment as well as adjustment of roles, missions, and
capabilities; these capabilities underpin the credibility of U.S. commitments to the defense of Japan and
peace and security of the region.

-  Enhanced coordination and improved interoperability between headquarters for flexible and responsive
command and control is a core capability of critical importance to the U.S. and Japan. In that context, both
sides recognized the continued importance of Headquarters, U.S. Forces Japan for strengthened bilateral
coordination.

-  Regular training and exercises, as well as availability of facilities and areas for these purposes, are essential
to ensure readiness, employability, and interoperability of forces. When consistent with military missions
and operational requirements, dispersal of training can provide greater diversity of training opportunities and
can have the ancillary benefit of reducing burdens of training on local communities.

-  Shared military use of both U.S. and SDF facilities and areas is valuable in promoting effectiveness of


-----

bilateral cooperation and increasing efficiencies.

-  Adequate capacity of U.S. facilities and areas is necessary, and the capacity above typical daily peacetime
usage levels also plays a critical and strategic role in meeting contingency requirements. This capacity can
provide an indispensable and critical capability toward meeting local emergency needs such as in disaster
relief and consequence management situations.

-  Particular attention will be paid to possible realignment of force structure in such regions where U.S.
facilities and areas are concentrated in densely populated areas.

-  Opportunities to introduce civil-military dual-use of U.S. facilities and areas will be studied, where
appropriate. Implementation of such dual-use must be compatible with military missions and operational
requirements.
2. Recommendations for Realignment
Based upon intensive consultations conducted thus far and in keeping with these basic precepts, domestic and
bilateral coordination should be conducted for the following initiatives in a timely manner, consistent with the
U.S.-Japan Security Treaty and its related arrangements. The Ministers committed themselves to completing
local coordination, and directed their staffs to finalize these specific and interrelated initiatives and develop
plans, including concrete implementation schedules no later than March 2006. These initiatives represent
elements of a coherent package, which will begin to be implemented upon agreement on the overall package.
Both sides emphasized the importance of taking necessary measures required for the prompt implementation of
these initiatives.

-  Strengthening Bilateral and Joint Operational Coordination.
Recognizing the Government of Japan’s intention to transform the SDF into a joint operations posture, the
Headquarters, U.S. Forces Japan will establish a bilateral and joint operations coordination center at Yokota
Air Base. The shared use of this center will ensure constant connectivity, coordination, and interoperability
among U.S. forces in Japan and the SDF.

-  Improvement of U.S. Army Command and Control Capability.
The capabilities of the U.S. Army Japan’s command structure in Camp Zama will be modernized to a
deployable, joint task force-capable operational headquarters element. The transformed command structure
will provide an additional capability to respond rapidly for the defense of Japan and other contingencies.
Adjustments to U.S. facilities and areas will be made to accommodate the new Army command structure and
integral capabilities. The establishment of the headquarters of a Ground SDF Central Readiness Force
Command, which will operate units for nation-wide mobile operations and special tasks, will be pursued at
Camp Zama, thereby strengthening the coordination between the headquarters. In relation to this
realignment, possibilities of more effective and efficient use of Camp Zama and Sagami General Depot will
be explored.

-  Collocation of Air Command and Control.
Japan’s Air Defense Command and relevant units, currently located at Fuchu, will be collocated with the
headquarters of the U.S. 5th Air Force at Yokota Air Base, strengthening the coordination between air and
missile defense command and control elements, and sharing relevant sensor data through the bilateral and
joint operations coordination center described above.

-  Yokota Air Base and Air Space.
Measures to facilitate movement of civilian aircraft through Yokota air space will be explored, bearing in
mind the planned expansion of nearby Haneda Airport in 2009. Possible options to study will include
reducing the air space under U.S. control and collocation of Japanese air traffic controllers at Yokota Air
Base. In addition, both sides will take into account development of the process of transferring the Kadena
radar approach control. The specific conditions and modalities for possible civil-military dual-use will be


-----

studied, while noting that dual-use must not compromise the military operational capabilities of Yokota Air
Base.

-  Missile Defense.
The optimum site for deployment in Japan of a new U.S. X-Band radar system will be examined. Through
timely information sharing, this radar will support capabilities to intercept missiles directed at Japan and
capabilities for Japan’s civil defense and consequence management. In addition, as appropriate, the U.S. will
deploy active defenses, such as Patriot PAC-3 and Standard Missile (SM-3) to support U.S. treaty
commitments.

-  Regional Realignment of U.S. Marine Forces for Flexible Crisis Response.
As part of its global posture realignment effort, the U.S. is making several changes to strengthen its force
structure in the Pacific. Among these changes are a strengthening of Marine Corps crisis response
capabilities and a redistribution of those capabilities among Hawaii, Guam and Okinawa that will provide
greater flexibility to respond with appropriate capabilities according to the nature and location of particular
situations. These changes will also enable increased theater security cooperation with countries of the region,
thereby improving the overall security environment. In connection with this realignment, both sides
identified an integrated set of interrelated measures that will also substantially reduce burdens in Okinawa.

❍ Acceleration of Futenma Relocation: Both sides, bearing in mind the strong request from residents of
Okinawa for early return of Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) Futenma, as well as the preference that
any Futenma replacement facility (FRF) be located outside of Okinawa prefecture, considered options to
satisfy these requests while maintaining the deterrence capabilities that will remain necessary in the
future. They determined that the rapid crisis response capabilities provided by the presence of Marine
Corps forces constitute a critical alliance capability that both sides desire to maintain in the region.
Moreover, they recognized that sustaining those capabilities, which consist of air, ground, logistics and
command elements, remains dependent upon the interaction of those elements in regular training,
exercises and operations. For this reason, both sides concluded that the FRF must be located within
Okinawa prefecture where rotary wing aircraft currently stationed at Futenma Air Station will be near
the other elements with which they operate on a regular basis.

❍ Both sides, recognizing the extensive delays in Futenma relocation resulting from the many problems
related to the 1996 Special Action Committee on Okinawa (SACO) plan for relocation of Futenma Air
Station to a civil-military facility located on a coral reef in deep waters, examined numerous other
possible options for relocation within Okinawa prefecture that could accelerate return of Futenma Air
Station while maintaining operational capabilities. Both sides considered several factors in this work,
including:

-  Safety of neighboring communities and military personnel.

-  Noise impacts on local communities, taking into account future housing and commercial development
patterns that might occur in the vicinity of the FRF.

-  Minimization of adverse environmental impacts.

-  Ability of the FRF to support operational and mission requirements in peacetime and in contingencies.

-  Inclusion of necessary operational support, billeting and related facilities in the FRF, to avoid creation
of traffic congestion and related irritants that might otherwise detract from the quality of life of local
residents.

❍ Bearing such factors in mind, both sides will locate the FRF in an “L”-shaped configuration that
combines the shoreline areas of Camp Schwab and adjacent water areas of Oura Bay. The runway
portion of the facility will cross Henoko-saki, extending from Oura Bay into the water areas along the
south shore of Camp Schwab. The lower section of the facility, oriented in a northeast-southwest


-----

direction will include a runway and overruns, with a total length of 1,800 meters exclusive of seawalls.
Hangers, maintenance, fuel supply pier and related infrastructure, and other aviation support activities
required for the operation of the new facility will be located on the areas of the FRF to be constructed
within Oura Bay. Furthermore, facilities in the Camp Schwab area will be reconfigured as necessary to
accommodate the relocation of Futenma-related activities. (Reference: Initialed concept plan dated 26
October 2005.)

❍ Both sides concurred that other capabilities now present at Futenma Air Station would be relocated and
maintained as provided for in the SACO Final Report, with the following adjustments:

-  With regards to the KC-130’s, which are to be relocated from Futenma Air Station to Iwakuni Air
Station under SACO Final Report, alternative facilities will be considered with priority consideration
given to Maritime SDF Kanoya Base. The final basing configuration will be determined by both sides
based on ongoing operational and engineering studies.

-  Strengthened contingency use of the Air SDF bases at Nyutabaru and Tsuiki will be provided for U.S.
forces. Improvements to operational facilities at these bases will be made to support this contingency
use. These improved facilities, when completed, will also support the expanded bilateral training
activities described in the Roles, Missions and Capabilities section of this report.

-  Improved contingency use of civilian facilities for long runway operations that cannot be replicated at
the FRF will also be provided for U.S. forces.

❍ Both sides recognized that early realization of the foregoing measures, in addition to enabling the longdesired return of Futenma Air Station, is an essential component of the realignment of the Marine Corps
presence in Okinawa.

❍ Force Reductions: In conjunction with the realignment of U.S. Marine Corps capabilities in the Pacific
region outlined above, the headquarters of the III Marine Expeditionary Force (III MEF) will be
relocated to Guam and other locations and the remaining Marine units in Okinawa will be realigned and
reduced into a Marine Expeditionary Brigade (MEB). This realignment in Okinawa will include the
transfer of approximately 7,000 Marine officers and enlisted personnel, plus dependents out of Okinawa.
These transferred personnel will come from units in each of the elements of Marine capability (air,
ground, logistics and command), including portions of the Marine Air Wing, the Force Service Support
Group, and the 3d Marine Division.

❍ The Government of Japan, recognizing the strong desire of Okinawa residents that such force relocations
be realized rapidly, will work with the U.S. Government to examine and identify appropriate financial
and other measures to enable the realization of these relocations to Guam.

❍ Land Returns and Shared-Use of Facilities: Recognizing that successful relocation of Futenma Air
Station and the force reductions described above will make further consolidation of forces and return of
land possible, both sides discussed the concept of consolidation of those Marine Corps units that remain
in Okinawa into a smaller total land area. This would enable the return of significant land in the densely
populated areas south of Kadena Air Base. The U.S. stressed its willingness to develop and implement a
concrete program for this concept in cooperation with the Government of Japan.

❍ Furthermore, recognizing the limited access that the SDF have to facilities in Okinawa, most of which
are located in urbanized areas, the U.S. also underscored its willingness to implement shared-use of
Kadena Air Base, Camp Hansen, and other U.S. facilities and areas in Okinawa in cooperation with the
Government of Japan. Both sides consider that such shared use could facilitate bilateral training and
interoperability between their forces, as described in the Roles, Missions and Capabilities section of this
report, and thereby strengthen overall alliance capabilities.

❍ Steady Implementation of SACO Final Report: Both sides validated the importance of steady


-----

implementation of the recommendations of the Special Action Committee on Okinawa (SACO) Final
Report unless otherwise changed by the recommendations in this document.

-  Relocation of Carrier Air Wing from Atsugi Air Facility to Iwakuni Air Station.
To ensure the viability of a long-term forward-deployment of the U.S. aircraft carrier and its airwing, the
carrier jet and E-2C squadrons will be relocated from Atsugi Air Facility to Iwakuni Air Station, which will
have the necessary facilities and training airspace for safe and effective operation of the aircraft in a less
intrusive manner after the current construction of the replacement runway is completed. To alleviate the
impact of the increased operations at Iwakuni Air Station, the following related measures will be taken.

❍ Relocation of Maritime SDF E/O/UP-3 squadrons and other aircraft from Iwakuni Air Station to Atsugi
Air Facility.

❍ Adjustment of training airspace for all U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps aircraft to ensure adequate
readiness levels are maintained.

❍ Identification of a permanent field-carrier landing practice (FCLP) facility. In the interim, the U.S. will
continue to conduct FCLPs at Iwo Jima in accordance with existing temporary arrangements. The
Government of Japan reiterates its commitment to provide an acceptable permanent FCLP facility for
U.S. naval aviation forces.

❍ Development of necessary facilities at the Maritime SDF Kanoya Base to accommodate KC-130
aircraft. These facilities will also be available to support rotations of additional SDF or U.S. C-130 or P3 aircraft from elsewhere in Japan to increase alliance capabilities and flexibility.

❍ Development of necessary additional facilities, infrastructure, and training areas required to support U.S.
Navy and U.S. Marine Corps units based at Iwakuni Air Station, as well as civil aviation operations.

-  Training Relocation.
Consistent with the necessity of improving bilateral interoperability discussed in this report, and with
reference to the goal of reducing the impact of training activity, renewed attention will be given to
expanding the distribution of training from U.S. air facilities such as Kadena Air Base as well as Misawa Air
Base and Iwakuni Air Station to other military facilities.

-  Efficient Use of Capacity at U.S. Facilities in Japan.
Opportunities to strengthen U.S. cooperation with the Government of Japan and local communities regarding
efficient use of capacity at U.S. facilities in Japan will be pursued when consistent with operational
requirements and safety. For example, both sides will explore possibilities for utilizing the capacity of
Sagami General Depot for meeting local emergency needs such as in disaster relief and civilian consequence
management.
Future changes in U.S. facilities and areas and force structure not addressed elsewhere in this report will
be addressed in accordance with existing practices under the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty and its related
arrangements.

**Statement**

(Washington DC, May 1, 2006)

The U.S.-Japan Alliance, with the U.S.-Japan security relationship at its core, is the indispensable foundation
of Japan’s security and of peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region and the linchpin of American security
policy in the region. This strong partnership is increasingly vital in meeting global challenges, and in
promoting fundamental values shared by both nations, including basic human rights, freedom, democracy, and


-----

the rule of law. The alliance has successfully adapted itself to changes in the regional and global security
environment, and it must continue to evolve in depth and scope in order to address future challenges. To
remain strong, this partnership must be reinforced by continued firm public support in both countries.
At today’s meeting, the Ministers, sharing the view that new and emerging threats pose a common
challenge that affects the security of nations worldwide, noted the increasingly close cooperation between their
two countries on a broad array of issues. The Ministers confirmed their desire to expand that cooperation to
ensure the U.S.-Japan Alliance continues to play a vital role in enhancing regional and global peace and
security. The Ministers noted the importance of U.S. and Japanese efforts to strengthen democracy in and
reconstruct Iraq and Afghanistan, and to support reform efforts in the broader Middle East. They committed to
work closely on efforts to convince Iran to suspend all enrichment-related activities and cooperate fully with
the International Atomic Energy Agency’s investigation, and agreed on the need for concerted United Nations
Security Council action.
As elsewhere in the world, the Asia-Pacific region faces persistent challenges that give rise to
unpredictability and uncertainty. The Ministers reconfirmed a shared commitment to the Joint Statement of the
Six-Party Talks, and urged North Korea to return expeditiously to the talks without preconditions, to dismantle
its nuclear programs in a complete, verifiable and irreversible manner, and to cease all illicit and proliferation
activities. They reaffirmed the importance of resolving regional disputes through diplomatic efforts, and called
for greater transparency on the modernization of military capabilities in the region.
In this security environment, the Ministers affirmed their commitment to close cooperation in realizing the
common strategic objectives the Security Consultative Committee (SCC) identified in February 2005. The
Ministers stressed the imperative of strengthening and improving the effectiveness of bilateral security and
defense cooperation in such areas as ballistic missile defense, bilateral contingency planning, information
sharing and intelligence cooperation, and international peace cooperation activities, as well as the importance
of improving interoperability of Japan’s Self-Defense Forces and U.S. forces, as outlined in the
recommendations on bilateral roles, missions, and capabilities described in the October 2005 SCC document.
In this context, the Ministers emphasized the importance of examining the scope of security and defense
cooperation to ensure a robust alliance relationship, and to enhance the alliance’s capability to respond to
diverse challenges in the evolving regional and global security environment.
At the SCC meeting held today, the Ministers approved implementation details for the October 2005
realignment initiatives, which are described in today’s SCC document, “United States-Japan Roadmap for
Realignment Implementation.” The Ministers recognized that the implementation of these realignment
initiatives will lead to a new phase in alliance cooperation and strengthened alliance capabilities in the region.
The measures to be implemented demonstrate the resolve of both parties to strengthen their commitments
under the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty and, at the same time, to reduce the burden on local communities,
including those on Okinawa, thereby providing the basis for enhanced public support for the security alliance.
Recognizing the Government of Japan’s coordination with local communities, the Ministers confirmed the
feasibility of the realignment initiatives. Recognizing also that completion of these realignment initiatives is
essential to strengthen the foundation of alliance transformation, the Ministers committed themselves to the
timely and thorough implementation of the plan, consistent with the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty and its related
arrangements.

**Reference 39. United States-Japan Roadmap for Realignment Implementation**

(Washington DC, May 1, 2006)

**Overview**
On October 29, 2005, the U.S.-Japan Security Consultative Committee (SCC) members approved
recommendations for realignment of U.S. forces in Japan and related Japan Self-Defense Forces (SDF) in their
document, “U.S.-Japan Alliance: Transformation and Realignment for the Future.” In that document, the SCC
members directed their respective staffs “to finalize these specific and interrelated initiatives and develop
plans, including concrete implementation schedules no later than March 2006.” This work has been completed
and is reflected in this document.

**Finalization of Realignment Initiatives**
The individual realignment initiatives form a coherent package. When implemented, these realignments will
ensure a life-of-the-alliance presence for U.S. forces in Japan.
The construction and other costs for facility development in the implementation of these initiatives will be
borne by the Government of Japan (GOJ) unless otherwise specified. The U.S. Government (USG) will bear
the operational costs that arise from implementation of these initiatives. The two Governments will finance
their realignment-associated costs consistent with their commitments in the October 29, 2005 SCC document to
maintain deterrence and capabilities while reducing burdens on local communities.

**Key Implementation Details**
1. Realignment on Okinawa
(a) Futenma Replacement Facility (FRF)

-  The United States and Japan will locate the FRF in a configuration that combines the Henoko-saki and
adjacent water areas of Oura and Henoko Bays, including two runways aligned in a “V”-shape, each
runway having a length of 1,600 meters plus two 100-meter overruns. The length of each runway
portion of the facility is 1,800 meters, exclusive of seawalls (see attached concept plan dated April 28,
2006). This facility ensures agreed operational capabilities while addressing issues of safety, noise,
and environmental impacts.

-  In order to locate the FRF, inclusive of agreed support facilities, in the Camp Schwab area, necessary
adjustments will be made, such as reconfiguration of Camp Schwab facilities and adjacent water
surface areas.

-  Construction of the FRF is targeted for completion by 2014.

-  Relocation to the FRF will occur when the facility is fully operationally capable.

-  Facility improvements for contingency use at Air SDF bases at Nyutabaru and Tsuiki related to
replacement of Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) Futenma capabilities will be made, as necessary,
after conducting site surveys and before MCAS Futenma is returned.

-  Requirements for improved contingency use of civilian facilities will be examined in the context of
bilateral contingency planning, and appropriate arrangements will be made in order to realize the
return of MCAS Futenma.

-  In principle, the construction method for the FRF will be landfill.

-  The USG does not have a plan to operate fighter aircraft from this facility.
(b) Force Reductions and Relocation to Guam

-  Approximately 8,000 III Marine Expeditionary Force (MEF) personnel and their approximately 9,000
dependents will relocate from Okinawa to Guam by 2014, in a manner that maintains unit integrity.


-----

Units to relocate will include: III MEF Command Element, 3d Marine Division Headquarters, 3d
Marine Logistics Group (formerly known as Force Service Support Group) Headquarters, 1st Marine
Air Wing Headquarters, and 12th Marine Regiment Headquarters.

-  The affected units will relocate from such facilities as Camp Courtney, Camp Hansen, MCAS
Futenma, Camp Zukeran, and Makiminato Service Area.

-  The U.S. Marine Corps (USMC) forces remaining on Okinawa will consist of Marine Air-Ground
Task Force elements, such as command, ground, aviation, and combat service support, as well as a
base support capability.

-  Of the estimated $10.27 billion cost of the facilities and infrastructure development costs for the III
MEF relocation to Guam, Japan will provide $6.09 billion (in U.S. Fiscal Year 2008 dollars),
including $2.8 billion in direct cash contributions, to develop facilities and infrastructure on Guam to
enable the III MEF relocation, recognizing the strong desire of Okinawa residents that such force
relocation be realized rapidly. The United States will fund the remainder of the facilities and
infrastructure development costs for the relocation to Guam-estimated in U.S. Fiscal Year 2008 dollars
at $3.18 billion in fiscal spending plus approximately $1 billion for a road.
(c) Land Returns and Shared Use of Facilities

-  Following the relocation to the FRF, the return of MCAS Futenma, and the transfer of III MEF
personnel to Guam, the remaining facilities and areas on Okinawa will be consolidated, thereby
enabling the return of significant land areas south of Kadena Air Base.

-  Both sides will develop a detailed consolidation plan by March 2007. In this plan, total or partial
return of the following six candidate facilities will be examined:

❍ Camp Kuwae: Total return.
❍ Camp Zukeran: Partial return and consolidation of remaining facilities and infrastructure to the
extent possible.

❍ MCAS Futenma: Total return (see FRF section above).
❍ Makiminato Service Area: Total return.
❍ Naha Port: Total return (relocated to the new facilities, including additional staging area, to be
constructed at Urasoe).

❍ Army POL Depot Kuwae Tank Farm No. 1: Total return.

-  All functions and capabilities that are resident in facilities designated for return, and that are required
by forces remaining in Okinawa, will be relocated within Okinawa. These relocations will occur
before the return of designated facilities.

-  While emphasizing the importance of steady implementation of the recommendations of the Special
Action Committee on Okinawa (SACO) Final Report, the SACO relocation and return initiatives may
need to be re-evaluated.

-  Camp Hansen will be used for Ground SDF training. Shared use that requires no facility
improvements will be possible from 2006.

-  Air SDF will use Kadena Air Base for bilateral training with U.S. forces, taking into account noise
impacts on local communities.
(d) Relationships among Initiatives

-  Within the overall package, the Okinawa-related realignment initiatives are interconnected.

-  Specifically, consolidation and land returns south of Kadena depend on completing the relocation of
III MEF personnel and dependents from Okinawa to Guam.

-  The III MEF relocation from Okinawa to Guam is dependent on: (1) tangible progress toward
completion of the FRF, and (2) Japan’s financial contributions to fund development of required
facilities and infrastructure on Guam.


-----

2. Improvement of U.S. Army Command and Control Capability

-  U.S. Army command and control structure at Camp Zama will be transformed by U.S. Fiscal Year 2008.
The headquarters of the Ground SDF Central Readiness Force subsequently will arrive at Camp Zama by
Japan Fiscal Year 2012; SDF helicopters will have access to Kastner Heliport on Camp Zama.

-  Along with the transformation of Army headquarters in Japan, a battle command training center and other
support facilities will be constructed within Sagami General Depot (SGD) using U.S. funding.

-  In relation to this transformation, the following measures for efficient and effective use of Camp Zama and
SGD will be implemented.

❍ Some portions of land at SGD will be returned for local redevelopment (approximately 15 hectares (ha))
and for road and underground rail (approximately 2 ha). Affected housing units will be relocated to
Sagamihara Housing Area.

❍ A specified area of open space in the northwest section of SGD (approximately 35 ha) will be provided
for local use when not required for contingency or training purposes.

❍ Portions of the Chapel Hill housing area of Camp Zama (1.1 ha) will be returned to the GOJ following
relocation of affected housing units within Camp Zama. Further discussions on possible additional land
returns at Chapel Hill will occur as appropriate.
3. Yokota Air Base and Air Space

-  Air SDF Air Defense Command (ADC) and relevant units will relocate to Yokota Air Base in Japan Fiscal
Year 2010. A bilateral master plan for base use will be developed to accommodate facility and infrastructure
requirements.

-  A bilateral, joint operations coordination center (BJOCC), established at Yokota Air Base, will include a
collocated air and missile defense coordination function. The USG and GOJ will fund their own required
equipment and systems, respectively, while both sides will coordinate appropriate funding of shared-use
equipment and systems.

-  The following measures will be pursued to facilitate movement of civilian aircraft through Yokota airspace
while satisfying military operational requirements.

❍ Establish a program in Japan Fiscal Year 2006 to inform commercial aviation entities of existing
procedures to transit Yokota airspace.

❍ Return portions of Yokota airspace to Japanese control by September 2008; specific portions will be
identified by October 2006.

❍ Develop procedures in Japan Fiscal Year 2006 for temporary transfers of air traffic control responsibility
to Japanese authorities for portions of Yokota airspace, when not required for military purposes.

❍ Study the conditions required for the possible return of the entire Yokota airspace as part of a
comprehensive study of options for related airspace reconfigurations and changes in air traffic control
procedures that would satisfy future patterns of civilian and military (U.S. and Japanese) demand for use
of Japanese airspace. The study will take into account both the lessons learned from the Kadena radar
approach control (RAPCON) transfer experience and the lessons learned from experiences with
collocation of U.S. forces and Japanese controllers in Japan. This study will be completed in Japan Fiscal
Year 2009.

-  The USG and GOJ will conduct a study of the specific conditions and modalities for possible civilianmilitary dual-use of Yokota Air Base, to be completed within 12 months from commencement.

❍ The study will be conducted on the shared understanding that dual-use must not compromise military
operations and safety or the military operational capabilities of Yokota Air Base.

❍ Based upon the outcome of this study, the two governments will consult and then make appropriate
decisions on civilian-military dual-use.

4. Relocation of Carrier Air Wing from Atsugi Air Facility to Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) Iwakuni

-  The relocation of Carrier Air Wing Five (CVW-5) squadrons from Atsugi Air Facility to MCAS Iwakuni,
consisting of F/A-18, EA-6B, E-2C, and C-2 aircraft, will be completed by 2014, subsequent to the
following: (1) completion of necessary facilities, and (2) adjustment of training airspace and the Iwakuni
RAPCON airspace.

-  Necessary facilities will be developed at Atsugi Air Facility to accommodate Maritime SDF E/O/UP-3
squadrons and other aircraft from Iwakuni, taking into account the continued requirement for U.S. operations
from Atsugi.

-  The KC-130 squadron will be based at MCAS Iwakuni with its headquarters, maintenance support facilities,
and family support facilities. The aircraft will regularly deploy on a rotational basis for training and
operations to Maritime SDF Kanoya Base and Guam. To support the deployment of KC-l30 aircraft,
necessary facilities will be developed at Kanoya.

-  U.S. Marine Corps CH-53D helicopters will be relocated from MCAS Iwakuni to Guam when the III MEF
personnel relocate from Okinawa to Guam.

-  Training airspace and Iwakuni RAPCON airspace will be adjusted to fulfill safely the training and
operational requirements of U.S. forces, Japan SDF, and commercial aircraft (including those in neighboring
airspace) through coordination by the Joint Committee.

-  A bilateral framework to conduct a study on a permanent field-carrier landing practice facility will be
established, with the goal of selecting a permanent site by July 2009 or the earliest possible date thereafter.

-  Portions of the future civilian air facility will be accommodated at MCAS Iwakuni.
5. Missile Defense

-  As both sides deploy additional capabilities and improve their respective ballistic missile defense
capabilities, close coordination will continue.

-  The optimum site for deployment of a new U.S. X-Band radar system has been designated as Air SDF
Shariki Base. Necessary arrangements and facility modifications, funded by the USG, will be made before
the radar becomes operational in summer 2006.

-  The USG will share X-Band radar data with the GOJ.

-  U.S. Patriot PAC-3 capabilities will be deployed to Japan within existing U.S. facilities and areas, becoming
operational at the earliest possible time.
6. Training Relocation

-  Both sides will develop annual bilateral training plans beginning in Japan Fiscal Year 2007. As necessary, a
supplemental plan for Japan Fiscal Year 2006 can be developed.

-  Initially, aircraft from three U.S. facilities—Kadena, Misawa, and Iwakuni—will participate in relocated
training conducted from the following SDF facilities: Chitose, Misawa, Hyakuri, Komatsu, Tsuiki, and
Nyutabaru. Both sides will work toward expanding use of SDF facilities for bilateral training and exercises
in the future.

-  The GOJ will improve infrastructure for training relocation at SDF facilities as necessary after conducting
site surveys.

-  Relocated training will not diminish the quality of training that is currently available to U.S. forces in Japan,
taking into account facilities and training requirements.

-  In general, bilateral training will commence with participation of 1-5 aircraft for the duration of 1-7 days,
and develop over time to participation of 6-12 aircraft for 8-14 days at a time.

-  At those SDF facilities at which terms of joint use are stipulated by Joint Committee agreements, limitations
on the number of joint training events will be removed. Limitations on the total days and period per training
event for joint use of each SDF facility will be maintained.


-----

-  The USG and GOJ will share costs for bilateral training as appropriate, bearing in mind the priority of
maintaining readiness.

**Structure in Japan and Others**

May 30, 2006

### ( Cabinet Decision )

1. The governments of Japan and the U.S. government had a series of consultations regarding examinations
of the roles, missions and capabilities of Japan’s Self-Defense Forces (SDF) and the U.S. Armed Forces,
and of realignment of U.S. force structure in Japan. And at the Security Consultative Committee (SCC)
Meeting of October 29, 2005, recommendations on those issues were approved. The governments of the
two countries continued consultations and at the SCC Meeting of May 1, 2006 the final report including
specific initiatives for realignment of U.S. force structure in Japan and other issues (hereinafter
“realignment related measures”) was approved.
2. In the new security environment, it is important to maintain and develop the Japan-U.S. Security
Arrangements to ensure the security of Japan and maintain the peace and stability of the Asia-Pacific
region in a continuous manner. Stationing of the U.S. forces in Japan is a core of the Japan-U.S. Security
Arrangements, and stable use of facilities and areas of the U.S. forces needs to be secured.
Facilities and areas used by the U.S. forces concentrate on Okinawa, and areas around facilities and
areas on the mainland are increasingly urbanized, hence these facilities and areas have great impact on
living environment of residents and regional development. In light of such conditions, it is important to
maintain deterrence and capabilities while reducing burdens on local communities, in order to secure
stable use of facilities and areas by gaining broader public understanding and cooperation as well as to
maintain and develop the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements.
3. The final report includes following specific initiatives: relocation of approximately 8,000 Marine Corps
personnel from Okinawa where facilities and areas used by the U.S. forces concentrate; relocation of the
Futenma Air Station to Camp Schwab; return of significant land areas south of Kadena Air Base which are
densely populated (including total returns of Futenma Air Station, Makiminato Service Area, Naha port
facilities and other facilities); collocation of Air SDF Air Defense Command and relevant units at Yokota
Air Base to enhance coordination between the headquarters; transformation of the U.S. Army command
and control structure at Camp Zama; deployment of a new U.S. X-Band radar system for the BMD at Air
SDF Shariki Base; relocation of Carrier Air Wing from Atsugi Air Facility to Iwakuni Air Station; return
of some portions of Camp Zama and Sagami General Depot; and relocation of trainings.
These realignment related measures shall be steadily implemented based on timeframe for
implementation presented in the final report.
4. Ensuring security arrangements for maintenance of the peace and security of Japan is one of the most
significant policies of the Japanese government, therefore, it is necessary for the government to address
the issue with responsibility. Based on such recognition, in implementing realignment related measures
that entail new burdens on the part of local authorities, the government will take requests from the local
authorities that shoulder such burdens into consideration, and take measures for regional development and
other in return for their contributions to the peace and security of Japan.
In addition, the government of Japan will continue to be totally committed to taking measures in
promotion of the use of returned land and securing employment stability of workers at USFJ facilities and
areas.


-----

5. Relocation of Marine units in Okinawa to Guam is critical in reducing burdens on Okinawa where U.S.
facilities and areas concentrate, thus it shall be rapidly implemented with required costs shared by Japan.
6. Based on such recognition, the government of Japan shall properly and promptly implement realignment
related measures including legal and budgetary aspects. Meanwhile, under the strained state of public
finance, the government of Japan shall make efforts in more drastic rationalization and streamlining of
defense-related expenses to implement efficient defense program, in line with the efforts of the
government as a whole in cost-cutting and rationalization. The “Mid-Term Defense Program (for FY 2005
to FY 2009)” (approved by the Cabinet on December 10, 2004) shall be reviewed once estimates for the
entire costs of realignment related measures become clear based on concrete contents of realignment of
U.S. force structure in Japan and others.
7. As to relocation of Futenma Air Station, it shall be implemented based on the plan approved at the SCC
Meeting on May 1, 2006, with due consideration on the positions of the national government, the local
government of Okinawa and relevant local authorities, as well as the course of discussions so far regarding
the issues such as facilities related with relocation of Futenma Air Station, the basing agreement and
regional development and others, through paying enough attention to removal of danger of Futenma Air
Station, safety of lives of residents in the vicinity, preservation of natural environment and feasibility of
the program. Also a construction plan of the Futenma Replacement Facility (FRF) shall be formulated in a
prompt manner.
The government shall establish a consultative body together with the government of Okinawa and
relevant local governments to have consultations about and address the issues of a concrete construction
plan of the FRF, safety and environmental measure and regional development.
In accordance with this, the Government Policy Concerning Relocation of Futenma Air Station
(approved by the Cabinet on December 28, 1999) shall be abolished.
However, in FY 2006, the projects based on the “II Regional Development” stipulated in the
abovementioned government policy shall be implemented.

**Reference 41. Joint Statement of the U.S.-Japan Security Consultative Committee U.S.**
**Department of State**

(Washington DC, May 1, 2007)

**Alliance Transformation: Advancing United States-Japan Security and Defense Cooperation**

**I. Overview**
The U.S.-Japan security relationship is the bedrock of Japan’s defense and the keystone of peace and security
in the Asia-Pacific region. The members of the Security Consultative Committee (SCC) welcomed recent
advances in bilateral security and defense cooperation, consistent with the vision laid out in SCC meetings and
statements over the past two years. The North Korean provocations, including missile launches in July and a
nuclear test in October 2006, serve as stark reminders of the importance of transforming the U.S.-Japan
Alliance to ensure its continued effectiveness in an ever-changing security environment.
The SCC members recognized that, just as today’s expanding U.S.-Japan cooperation was enabled by
previous efforts to update and consolidate the alliance that began years ago, so too will investments that the
two countries make in the alliance today enable and ensure effective alliance responses to future challenges to
peace and security.


-----

Additionally, the SCC members stressed the importance of the traditional role of the Treaty of Mutual
Cooperation and Security, which has enabled a life-of-the-alliance presence for U.S. forces in Japan while
providing U.S. security assurances to the Government of Japan. U.S. extended deterrence underpins the
defense of Japan and regional security. The U.S. reaffirmed that the full range of U.S. military capabilities—
both nuclear and non-nuclear strike forces and defensive capabilities—form the core of extended deterrence
and support U.S. commitments to the defense of Japan.
In this context, the SCC members emphasized the need to expand and deepen bilateral intelligence
cooperation and information sharing in order to respond more effectively to emerging security challenges.
They also decided to strengthen mechanisms to protect classified materials.
President George W. Bush and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe met on November 18, 2006 and called for a
review of U.S.-Japan bilateral security cooperation, especially in the area of ballistic missile defense (BMD),
reiterating its importance during their April 27, 2007 summit meeting. The SCC members focused on this
agenda today in the context of common strategic objectives and alliance transformation.
The SCC members also welcomed the elevation of Japan’s defense organization from agency to ministry
status and the redefinition of the Self-Defense Forces’ (SDF) international peace cooperation activities as part
of their primary missions.

**II. Common Strategic Objectives**
The U.S. and Japan are committed to promoting fundamental values such as basic human rights, democracy,
and the rule of law in the international community. On February 19, 2005, the SCC members identified
common strategic objectives that provide a broad basis for advancing bilateral cooperation.
At today’s meeting, the SCC members reconfirmed their commitment to these common strategic
objectives, taking the current international security environment into account. In this context, they welcomed
the “Initial Actions for the Implementation of the Joint Statement” adopted at the fifth round of the Six-Party
Talks on February 13, 2007, and urged North Korea to expeditiously meet its commitments described in the
statement.
During their discussions, the SCC members highlighted the following strategic objectives that advance the
interests of both countries:

-  Achieving denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula through the Six-Party Talks and fully implementing the
Joint Statement of September 19, 2005, which envisions progress in other areas, including: the normalization
of relations between North Korea and the United States and Japan, respectively; resolution of humanitarian
issues, such as the matter of abductions; and commitment by all Six Parties to join efforts for lasting peace
and stability in Northeast Asia.

-  Achieving swift and full implementation of United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1718,
noting that all United Nations Member States remain obligated to comply with the provisions of that Chapter
VII resolution.

-  Recognizing the importance of China’s contributions to regional and global security, further encouraging
China to conduct itself as a responsible international stakeholder, improve transparency in its military affairs,
and maintain consistency between its stated policies and actions.

-  Increasing cooperation to strengthen the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum as the preeminent regional economic forum, recognizing its crucial role in promoting stability, security, and prosperity
in the region.

-  Supporting efforts made by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to promote democratic
values, good governance, the rule of law, human rights, fundamental freedoms, and a unified market economy


-----

in Southeast Asia, and building regional capacity and cooperation on critical non-traditional and transnational
security issues bilaterally and through the ASEAN Regional Forum.

-  Further strengthening trilateral cooperation among the United States, Japan, and Australia in the region and
around the world, including in the areas of security and defense, based on shared democratic values and
interests.

-  Continuing to build upon partnerships with India to advance areas of common interests and increase
cooperation, recognizing that India’s continued growth is inextricably tied to the prosperity, freedom, and
security of the region.

-  Ensuring Afghanistan’s successful economic reconstruction and political stabilization, which is essential to
securing broader regional security and to defeating terrorism. To that end, the United States and Japan are
both committed to supporting Afghanistan’s transition, which requires reconstruction, development, and
security.

-  Contributing to building a united, democratic Iraq capable of governing, defending, and sustaining itself,
while remaining an ally in the War on Terror.

-  Achieving swift, full implementation of UNSCR 1737 and 1747, aimed at bringing Iran into full compliance
with its International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) requirements. Noting the international community’s
continuing concerns regarding Iran’s activities in the Middle East, both countries share the view that Iran
must play a more positive role in the international community by demonstrating responsible behavior on the
issue of terrorism.

-  Achieving broader Japan-North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) cooperation, recognizing that NATO’s
global contributions to peace and security and the common strategic objectives of the U.S.-Japan Alliance are
consistent and complementary.

**III. Roles, Missions, and Capabilities**
On October 29, 2005, the SCC approved the document, “U.S.-Japan Alliance: Transformation and Realignment
for the Future,” which outlined initiatives on roles, missions, and capabilities of U.S. and Japanese forces.
Following through on the security agenda laid out in that SCC document is imperative to the alliance’s ability
to respond to diverse challenges in the contemporary security environment.
The SCC members reviewed progress in updating roles, missions, and capabilities in line with this alliance
transformation vision and highlighted:

-  The redefinition of the SDF’s primary mission to include international peace keeping operations, international
disaster relief operations, and responses to situations in areas surrounding Japan, which reflects growing
attention to the importance of Japan’s contributions to improving the international security environment. In
this context, the SCC members discussed SDF’s assistance for Iraq’s reconstruction efforts as well as its
support to coalition forces operating in the Indian Ocean.

-  Sustained progress in developing more specific planning to reflect the evolving security environment and to
better posture our two forces to operate together in a regional crisis. Because such planning requires further
coordination in a wide range of functions and fields, active participation of relevant ministries and agencies in
the bilateral planning process will remain vital.

-  Substantive agreement between the two governments concerning security measures for the protection of
classified military information, also known as a General Security of Military Information Agreement
(GSOMIA). The GSOMIA will facilitate information exchange and establish a common basis of information
security contributing to sharing of intelligence and defense program and operational information.

-  Establishment of a bilateral Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) Defense Working
Group to make steady progress in improving readiness and interoperability of U.S. and Japanese forces


-----

against CBRN weapons, ensuring sustained operational capability in the event of an attack by weapons of
mass destruction.

-  Establishment of a flexible, bilateral interagency coordination mechanism to coordinate policy, operational,
intelligence, and public affairs positions before and during crisis situations.

-  Execution of joint, bilateral training exercises to strengthen interoperability and advance alliance roles,
missions, and capabilities.
The SCC members, recognizing the growing importance of the U.S. force presence to Japanese and
regional security, stressed the requirement for appropriate resources to ensure the success of the alliance
transformation agenda. Both allies will also make best efforts to secure resources to improve alliance
capabilities and to sustain the presence of U.S. forces in Japan.

**IV. Implementation of the Realignment Roadmap**
The SCC members reaffirmed their resolve to steadily implement the realignment initiatives described in the
May 2006 SCC document, “United States-Japan Roadmap for Realignment Implementation.” These initiatives,
when implemented, will enhance U.S. and Japanese public support for the security alliance.
The SCC members reviewed and appreciated the progress made thus far with the initiatives described in the
“Roadmap” including:

-  The creation of a bilateral coordination mechanism in June 2006 providing implementation oversight for the
realignment initiatives;

-  Japanese Diet action on legislation and funding required to facilitate early implementation of realignment
initiatives;

-  Elaboration of the engineering and technical design for the Futenma Replacement Facility and the initiation of
surveys in the water areas offshore of Camp Schwab;

-  Significant cooperation toward relocation of the III Marine Expeditionary Force (MEF) personnel and their
dependents from Okinawa to Guam by 2014, including:

❍ The U.S. creation and funding of a Joint Guam Program Office to oversee planning and development
of the facilities in Guam;

❍ The launch of the U.S. environmental impact assessment process, including Notice of Intent to prepare
an Environmental Impact Statement, for the relocation of U.S. Marine Corps forces from Okinawa to
Guam; and

❍ Submission of the above-mentioned legislation to the Japanese Diet authorizing the Japan Bank for
International Cooperation (JBIC) to take appropriate measures under the direction of the Japanese
government to fulfill a portion of Japan’s financial commitments related to the relocation of III MEF
personnel and their dependents from Okinawa to Guam.

-  Commencement of the aircraft training relocation program in March 2007;

-  Implementation of flexible-use of Yokota airspace measures in September 2006, and agreement in October
2006 for return of portions of Yokota airspace to Japanese control by September 2008, and for collocation of
SDF controllers at the Yokota Radar Approach Control (RAPCON). These measures will help facilitate the
movement of civilian aircraft through Yokota airspace while satisfying military operational requirements; and

-  October 2006 launching of the Study Group on the specific conditions and modalities for possible civilmilitary dual-use of Yokota Air Base, as specified in the “Roadmap.”
The SCC members reaffirmed that completion of the Futenma Replacement Facility, in accordance with
the “Roadmap” by the target date of 2014, is the key to successful and timely implementation of the overall
realignment plan for Okinawa, including the III MEF relocation to Guam and subsequent consolidation of
remaining facilities and areas on Okinawa. The SCC members acknowledged the significant progress on a
detailed consolidation plan and directed their staffs to continue close consultations toward its completion.


-----

The SCC members also appreciated continued progress in implementation of commitments under the 1996
Special Action Committee on Okinawa (SACO) final report, including return of the Senaha Communications
Facility in September 2006, and the Sobe Communications Facility and the Yomitan Auxiliary Airfield in
December 2006, totaling more than 300 hectares/750 acres.

**V. Strengthening BMD and Operational Cooperation**
Alliance BMD capabilities, which contribute to the alliance’s overall deterrence posture, are strengthened to
the extent that U.S. and Japanese systems can operate together effectively. The SCC members confirmed that,
as both countries develop and deploy capabilities, every effort must be made to ensure tactical, operational, and
strategic coordination. In that light, the United States and Japan will take appropriate measures, in close
coordination, in response to ballistic missile threats against alliance interests.
In this context, the SCC members highlighted the following areas of operational cooperation:

-  To strengthen operational cooperation, bilateral planning efforts must take into account missile defense
capabilities, today and in the foreseeable future. To that end, the two sides’ forces will clarify concepts, roles,
and missions for each side in the conduct of missile defense and related operations in response to ballistic
missile threats. At the same time, a policy-level forum will ensure that policy guidance for BMD operations is
unambiguous and current.

-  On October 29, 2005, the SCC directed the creation of a bilateral joint operations coordination center
(BJOCC). During the North Korean missile provocations of June-July 2006, the United States and Japan
exchanged information in a timely manner, including through an interim coordination facility at Yokota Air
Base with SDF liaisons. The success of this facility in ensuring that both sides had a common awareness of
the evolving situation validated the importance of continuous enhancement of bilateral policy/operational
coordination including through establishment of the BJOCC at Yokota Air Base.

-  Recognizing the importance of improving the situational awareness of U.S. forces and the SDF, the two sides
are committed to the routine sharing of BMD and related operational information directly with each other on
a real-time, continuous basis. The two sides will also develop a bilateral common operational picture (COP).

-  The two sides will establish a comprehensive information-sharing roadmap to identify broader operational
information and data to be shared in support of alliance roles, missions, and capabilities.

**VI. Enhancing BMD System Capabilities**
The SCC members noted with satisfaction that past alliance decisions about missile defense, coupled with
recent accelerated cooperation, have strengthened BMD capabilities in the region.
They highlighted key advances, including:

-  The operational deployment of a U.S. X-Band radar system to Air SDF Shariki Base, Japan, with associated
U.S. delivery of radar data to Japanese forces.

-  The operational deployment of a U.S. PAC-3 battalion to Kadena Air Base, Japan.

-  The recent and continuing addition of Standard Missile (SM-3) defense capabilities to the forward-deployed
naval forces of the U.S. Pacific Fleet.

-  Japan’s decision to accelerate modification of its Aegis ships with SM-3 capabilities. Japan will complete
modification of DDG Kongo by the end of 2007, and will expedite modification of DDGs Chokai, Myoko,
and Kirishima.

-  Japan’s decision to expedite the deployment of PAC-3, which resulted in deployment of the first PAC-3 fire
unit in March 2007 and its goal to deploy 16 PAC-3 capable fire units by early 2010.

-  Priority focus on U.S.-Japan cooperative development of the next generation SM-3 interceptor. The basic
agreement on a framework for technology transfer reached by the two sides will facilitate progress on this
project as well as in future U.S.-Japan technology cooperation projects.


-----

The SCC members confirmed that advancing the alliance transformation agenda for security and defense
cooperation will contribute to regional and global peace and security.

**Reference 42. Guidelines for Japan-U.S. Defense Cooperation**

(New York, September 23, 1997)

**I. The Aim of the Guidelines**
The aim of these Guidelines is to create a solid basis for more effective and credible Japan-U.S. cooperation
under normal circumstances, in case of an Armed Attack against Japan, and in situations in areas surrounding
Japan. The Guidelines also provide a general framework and policy direction for the roles and missions of the
two countries and ways of cooperation and coordination, both under normal circumstances and during
contingencies.

**II. Basic Premises and Principles**
The Guidelines and programs under the Guidelines are consistent with the following basic premises and
principles.
1. The rights and obligations under the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States
of America and Japan (the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty) and its related arrangements, as well as the
fundamental framework of the Japan-U.S. alliance, will remain unchanged.
2. Japan will conduct all its actions within the limitations of its Constitution and in accordance with such
basic positions as the maintenance of its exclusively defense-oriented policy and its three non-nuclear
principles.
3. All actions taken by Japan and the U.S. will be consistent with basic principles of international law,
including the peaceful settlement of disputes and sovereign equality, and relevant international agreements
such as the U.N. Charter.
4. The Guidelines and programs under the Guidelines will not obligate either Government to take legislative,
budgetary or administrative measures. However, since the objective of the Guidelines and programs under
the Guidelines is to establish an effective framework for bilateral cooperation, the two Governments are
expected to reflect in an appropriate way the results of these efforts, based on their own judgments, in their
specific policies and measures. All actions taken by Japan will be consistent with its laws and regulations
then in effect.

**III. Cooperation under Normal Circumstances**
Both Governments will firmly maintain existing Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements. Each Government will
make efforts to maintain required defense postures. Japan will possess defense capability within the scope
necessary for self-defense on the basis of the “National Defense Program Outline.” In order to meet its
commitments, the United States will maintain its nuclear deterrent capability, its forward deployed forces in the
Asia-Pacific region, and other forces capable of reinforcing those forward deployed forces.
Both Governments, based on their respective policies, under normal circumstances will maintain close
cooperation for the defense of Japan as well as for the creation of a more stable international security
environment.
Both Governments will under normal circumstances enhance cooperation in a variety of areas. Examples
include mutual support activities under the Agreement Between the Government of Japan and the Government


-----

of the United States of America concerning Reciprocal Provision of Logistic Support, Supplies and Services
between the Self-Defense Forces of Japan and the Armed Forces of the United States of America; the Mutual
Defense Assistance Agreement between the United States of America and Japan; and their related
arrangements.
1. Information Sharing and Policy Consultations
Recognizing that accurate information and sound analysis are at the foundation of security, the two
Governments will increase information and intelligence sharing, and the exchange of views on
international situations of mutual interest, especially in the Asia-Pacific region. They will also continue
close consultations on defense policies and military postures.
Such information sharing and policy consultations will be conducted at as many levels as possible and
on the broadest range of subjects. This will be accomplished by taking advantage of all available
opportunities, such as the Security Consultative Committee (SCC) and Security Sub-Committee (SSC)
meetings.
2. Various Types of Security Cooperation
Bilateral cooperation to promote regional and global activities in the field of security contributes to the
creation of a more stable international security environment.
Recognizing the importance and significance of security dialogues and defense exchange in the region,
as well as international arms control and disarmament, the two Governments will promote such activities
and cooperate as necessary.
When either or both Governments participate in U.N. PKOs or international humanitarian relief
operations, the two sides will cooperate closely for mutual support as necessary. They will prepare
procedures for cooperation in such areas as transportation, medical services, information sharing, and
education and training.
When either or both Governments conduct emergency relief operations in response to requests from
governments concerned or international organizations in the wake of large-scale disasters, they will
cooperate closely with each other as necessary.
3. Bilateral Programs
Both Governments will conduct bilateral work, including bilateral defense planning in case of an Armed
Attack against Japan, and mutual cooperation planning in situations in areas surrounding Japan. Such
efforts will be made in a comprehensive mechanism involving relevant agencies of the respective
Governments, and establish the foundation for bilateral cooperation.
Bilateral exercises and training will be enhanced in order not only to validate such bilateral work but
also to enable smooth and effective responses by public and private entities of both countries, starting with
the SDF and U.S. forces. The two Governments will under normal circumstances establish a bilateral
coordination mechanism involving relevant agencies to be operated during contingencies.

**IV. Actions in Response to an Armed Attack Against Japan**
Bilateral actions in response to an Armed Attack against Japan remain a core aspect of Japan-U.S. defense
cooperation.
When an Armed Attack against Japan is imminent, the two Governments will take steps to prevent further
deterioration of the situation and make preparations necessary for the defense of Japan. When an Armed Attack
against Japan takes place, the two Governments will conduct appropriate bilateral actions to repel it at the
earliest possible stage.
1. When an Armed Attack Against Japan is Imminent
The two Governments will intensify information and intelligence sharing and policy consultations, and
initiate at an early stage the operation of a bilateral coordination mechanism. Cooperating as appropriate,


-----

they will make preparations necessary for ensuring coordinated responses according to the readiness stage
selected by mutual agreement. Japan will establish and maintain the basis for U.S. reinforcements. As
circumstances change, the two Governments will also increase intelligence gathering and surveillance, and
will prepare to respond to activities, which could develop into an Armed Attack against Japan.
The two Governments will make every effort, including diplomatic efforts, to prevent further
deterioration of the situation.
Recognizing that a situation in areas surrounding Japan may develop into an Armed Attack against
Japan, the two Governments will be mindful of the close interrelationship of the two requirements:
preparations for the defense of Japan and responses to or preparations for situations in areas surrounding
Japan.
2. When an Armed Attack Against Japan Takes Place
(1) Principles for Coordinated Bilateral Actions
(a) Japan will have primary responsibility immediately to take action and to repel an Armed Attack
against Japan as soon as possible. The U.S. will provide appropriate support to Japan. Such
bilateral cooperation may vary according to the scale, type, phase, and other factors of the Armed
Attack. This cooperation may include preparations for and execution of coordinated bilateral
operations, steps to prevent further deterioration of the situation, surveillance, and intelligence
sharing.
(b) In conducting bilateral operations, the SDF and U.S. forces will employ their respective defense
capabilities in a coordinated, timely, and effective manner. In doing this, they will conduct
effective joint operations of their respective Forces’ ground, maritime and air services. The SDF
will primarily conduct defensive operations in Japanese territory and its surrounding waters and
airspace, while U.S. forces support SDF operations. U.S. forces will also conduct operations to
supplement the capabilities of the SDF.
(c) The U.S. will introduce reinforcements in a timely manner, and Japan will establish and maintain
the basis to facilitate these deployments.
(2) Concept of Operations
(a) Operations to Counter Air Attack Against Japan
The SDF and U.S. forces will bilaterally conduct operations to counter air attack against Japan.
The SDF will have primary responsibility for conducting operations for air defense.
U.S. forces will support SDF operations and conduct operations, including those, which may
involve the use of strike power, to supplement the capabilities of the SDF.
(b) Operations to Defend Surrounding Waters and to Protect Sea Lines of Communication
The SDF and U.S. forces will bilaterally conduct operations for the defense of surrounding waters
and for the protection of sea lines of communication.
The SDF will have primary responsibility for the protection of major ports and straits in
Japan, for the protection of ships in surrounding waters, and for other operations.
U.S. forces will support SDF operations and conduct operations, including those, which may
provide additional mobility and strike power, to supplement the capabilities of the SDF.
(c) Operations to Counter Airborne and Seaborne Invasions of Japan
The SDF and U.S. forces will bilaterally conduct operations to counter airborne and seaborne
invasions of Japan.
The SDF will have primary responsibility for conducting operations to check and repel such
invasions.


-----

U.S. forces will primarily conduct operations to supplement the capabilities of the SDF. The
U.S. will introduce reinforcements at the earliest possible stage, according to the scale, type, and
other factors of the invasion, and will support SDF operations.
(d) Responses to Other Threats
(i) The SDF will have primary responsibility to check and repel guerrilla-commando type attacks
or any other unconventional attacks involving military infiltration in Japanese territory at the
earliest possible stage. They will cooperate and coordinate closely with relevant agencies, and
will be supported in appropriate ways by U.S. forces depending on the situation.
(ii) The SDF and U.S. forces will cooperate and coordinate closely to respond to a ballistic
missile attack. U.S. forces will provide Japan with necessary intelligence, and consider, as
necessary, the use of forces providing additional strike power.
(3) Activities and Requirements for Operations
(a) Command and Coordination
The SDF and U.S. forces, in close cooperation, will take action through their respective
command-and-control channels. To conduct effective bilateral operations, the two Forces will
establish, in advance, procedures which include those to determine the division of roles and
missions and to synchronize their operations.
(b) Bilateral Coordination Mechanism
Necessary coordination among the relevant agencies of the two countries will be conducted
through a bilateral coordination mechanism. In order to conduct effective bilateral operations, the
SDF and U.S. forces will closely coordinate operations, intelligence activities, and logistics
support through this coordination mechanism including use of a bilateral coordination center.
(c) Communication and Electronics
The two Governments will provide mutual support to ensure effective use of communications and
electronics capabilities.
(d) Intelligence Activities
The two Governments will cooperate in intelligence activities in order to ensure effective bilateral
operations. This will include coordination of requirements, collection, production, and
dissemination of intelligence products. Each Government will be responsible for the security of
shared intelligence.
(e) Logistics Support Activities
The SDF and U.S. forces will conduct logistics support activities efficiently and properly in
accordance with appropriate bilateral arrangements.
To improve the effectiveness of logistics and to alleviate functional shortfalls, the two
Governments will undertake mutual support activities, making appropriate use of authorities and
assets of the central Government and local governments, as well as private sector assets.
Particular attention will be paid to the following points in conducting such activities:
(i) Supply
The U.S. will support the acquisition of supplies for systems of U.S. origin while Japan will
support the acquisition of supplies in Japan.
(ii) Transportation
The two Governments will closely cooperate in transportation operations, including airlift and
sealift of supplies from the U.S. to Japan.
(iii)Maintenance
Japan will support the maintenance of U.S. forces’ equipment in Japan; The U.S. will support
the maintenance of items of U.S. origin which are beyond Japanese maintenance capabilities.


-----

Maintenance support will include the technical training of maintenance personnel as required.
Japan will also support U.S. forces’ requirement for salvage and recovery.
(iv)Facilities
Japan will, in case of need, provide additional facilities and areas in accordance with the
Japan-U.S. Security Treaty and its related arrangements. If necessary for effective and
efficient operations, the SDF and U.S. forces will make joint use of SDF facilities and U.S.
facilities and areas in accordance with the Treaty and its related arrangements.
(v) Medical Services
The two Governments will support each other in the area of medical services such as medical
treatment and transportation of casualties.

**V. Cooperation in Situations in Areas Surrounding Japan that Will Have Important Influence on**
**Japan’s Peace and Security (Situations in Areas Surrounding Japan)**

Situations in areas surrounding Japan will have an important influence on Japan’s peace and security. The
concept, situations in area surrounding Japan, is not geographic but situational. The two Governments will
make every effort, including diplomatic efforts, to prevent such situations from occurring. When the two
Governments reach a common assessment of the state of each situation, they will effectively coordinate their
activities. In responding to such situations, measures taken may differ depending on circumstances.
1. When a Situation in Areas Surrounding Japan is Anticipated
When a situation in areas surrounding Japan is anticipated, the two Governments will intensify
information and intelligence sharing and policy consultations, including efforts to reach a common
assessment of the situation.
At the same time, they will make every effort, including diplomatic efforts, to prevent further
deterioration of the situation, while initiating at an early stage the operation of a bilateral coordination
mechanism, including use of a bilateral coordination center. Cooperating as appropriate, they will make
preparations necessary for ensuring coordinated responses according to the readiness stage selected by
mutual agreement. As circumstances change, they will also increase intelligence gathering and
surveillance, and enhance their readiness to respond to the circumstances.
2. Responses to Situations in Areas Surrounding Japan
The two Governments will take appropriate measures, to include preventing further deterioration of
situations, in response to situations in areas surrounding Japan. This will be done in accordance with the
basic premises and principles listed in Section II above and based on their respective decisions. They will
support each other as necessary in accordance with appropriate arrangements.
Functions and fields of cooperation and examples of items of cooperation are outlined below, and
listed in the Annex.
(1) Cooperation in Activities Initiated by Either Government
Although either Government may conduct the following activities at its own discretion, bilateral
cooperation will enhance their effectiveness.
(a) Relief Activities and Measures to Deal with Refugees
Each Government will conduct relief activities with the consent and cooperation of the authorities
in the affected area. The two Governments will cooperate as necessary, taking into account their
respective capabilities.
The two Governments will cooperate in dealing with refugees as necessary. When there is a
flow of refugees into Japanese territory, Japan will decide how to respond and will have primary
responsibility for dealing with the flow; the U.S. will provide appropriate support.


-----

(b) Search and Rescue
The two Governments will cooperate in search and rescue operations. Japan will conduct search
and rescue operation in Japanese territory; and at sea around Japan, as distinguished from areas
where combat operations are being conducted. When U.S. forces are conducting operations, the
United States will conduct search and rescue operations in and near the operational areas.
(c) Noncombatant Evacuation Operations
When the need arises for Japanese and U.S. noncombatants to be evacuated from a third country
to a safe haven, each Government is responsible for evacuating its own nationals as well as for
dealing with the authorities of the affected area. When both Governments deem it appropriate,
they will coordinate in planning and cooperate in carrying out such evacuations, including matters
that affect the securing of means of transportation and the use of transportation and facilities,
using their respective capabilities in a mutually supplementary manner. Should a similar need
arises with regard to noncombatants other than of Japanese or U.S. nationality, the respective
countries may consider extending, on their respective terms, evacuation assistance to third
country nationals.
(d) Activities for Ensuring the Effectiveness of Economic Sanctions for the Maintenance of
International Peace and Stability
Each Government will contribute to activities for ensuring the effectiveness of economic
sanctions for the maintenance of international peace and stability. Such contributions will be
made in accordance with each Government’s own criteria.
Additionally, the two Governments will cooperate with each other as appropriate, taking into
account their respective capabilities. Such cooperation includes information sharing, and
cooperation in inspection of ships based on U.N. Security Council resolutions.
(2) Japan’s Support for U.S. Forces Activities
(a) Use of Facilities
Based on the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty and its related arrangements, Japan will, in case of need,
provide additional facilities and areas in a timely and appropriate manner, and ensure the
temporary use by U.S. forces of SDF facilities and civilian airports and ports.
(b) Rear Area Support
Japan will provide rear area support to those U.S. forces that are conducting operations for the
purpose of achieving the objectives of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty. The primary aim of this
rear area support is to enable U.S. forces to use facilities and conduct operations in an effective
manner. By its very nature, Japan’s rear area support will be provided primarily in Japanese
territory. It may also be provided on the high seas and international airspace around Japan which
are distinguished from areas where combat operations are being conducted.
In providing rear area support, Japan will make appropriate use of the authority and capacity
of the central Government and local governments, as well as private sector capacity. The SDF, as
appropriate, will provide such support consistent with their mission for the defense of Japan and
the maintenance of public order.
(3) Japan-U.S. Operational Cooperation
As situations in areas surrounding Japan have an important influence on Japan’s peace and security,
the SDF will conduct such activities as intelligence gathering, surveillance and minesweeping, to
protect lives and property and to ensure navigational safety. U.S. forces will conduct operations to
restore the peace and security affected by situations in areas surrounding Japan.
With the involvement of relevant agencies, cooperation and coordination will significantly
enhance the effectiveness of both Forces’ activities.


-----

**VI. Bilateral Programs for Effective Defense Cooperation under the Guidelines**
Effective bilateral cooperation under the Guidelines will require Japan and the U.S. to conduct consultative
dialogue throughout the spectrum of security conditions: normal circumstances, an Armed Attack against
Japan, and situations in areas surrounding Japan. Both sides must be well informed and coordinate at multiple
levels to ensure successful bilateral defense cooperation. To accomplish this, the two Governments will
strengthen their information and intelligence sharing and policy consultations by taking advantage of all
available opportunities, including, SCC and SSC meetings, and they will establish the following two
mechanisms to facilitate consultations, coordinate policies, and coordinate operational functions.
First, the two Governments will develop a comprehensive mechanism for bilateral planning and the
establishment of common standards and procedures, involving not only the SDF and U.S. forces but also other
relevant agencies of their respective Governments.
The two Governments will, as necessary, improve this comprehensive mechanism. The SCC will continue
to play an important role in presenting policy direction for the work to be conducted by this mechanism. The
SCC will be responsible for presenting policy, validating the progress of work, and issuing directives as
necessary. The SDC will assist the SCC in bilateral work.
Second, the two Governments will also establish, under normal circumstances, a bilateral coordination
mechanism that will include relevant agencies of the two countries for coordinating respective activities during
contingencies.
1. Bilateral Work for Planning and the Establishment of Common Standards and Procedures
Bilateral work listed below will be conducted under a comprehensive mechanism, involving relevant
agencies of the respective Governments in a deliberate and efficient manner. Progress and results of such
work will be reported at significant intervals to the SCC and the SDC.
(1) Bilateral Defense Planning and Mutual Cooperation Planning
The SDF and U.S. forces will conduct bilateral defense planning under normal circumstances to take
coordinated actions smoothly and effectively in case of an Armed Attack against Japan. The two
Governments will conduct mutual cooperation planning under normal circumstances to be able to
respond smoothly and effectively to situations in areas surrounding Japan.
Bilateral defense planning and mutual cooperation planning will assume various possible
situations, with the expectation that the results of this planning work will be appropriately reflected in
the plans of the two Governments. The two Governments will coordinate and adjust their plans in
light of actual circumstances. The two Governments will be mindful that bilateral defense planning
and mutual cooperation planning must be consistent so that appropriate responses will be ensured
when a situation in areas surrounding Japan threatens to develop into an Armed Attack against Japan
or when such a situation and an Armed Attack against Japan occur simultaneously.
(2) Establishment of Common Standards for Preparations
The two Governments will establish under normal circumstances common standards for preparations
for the defense of Japan. These standards will address such matters as intelligence activities, unit
activities, movements and logistics support in each readiness stage. When an Armed Attack against
Japan is imminent, both Governments will agree to select a common readiness stage that will be
reflected in the level of preparations for the defense of Japan by U.S. forces, the SDF and other
relevant agencies.
The two Governments will similarly establish common standards for preparations of cooperative
measures in situations in areas surrounding Japan so that they may select a common readiness stage
by mutual agreement.


-----

(3) Establishment of Common Procedures
The two Governments will prepare in advance common procedures to ensure smooth and effective
execution of coordinated U.S. forces and SDF operations for the defense of Japan. These will include
procedures for communications, transmission of target information, intelligence activities and
logistics support, and prevention of fratricide. Common procedures will also include criteria for
properly controlling respective unit operations. The two Forces will take into account the importance
of communications and electronics interoperability, and will determine in advance their mutual
requirements.
2. Bilateral Coordination Mechanism
The two Governments will establish under normal circumstances a bilateral coordination mechanism
involving relevant agencies of the two countries to coordinate respective activities in case of an Armed
Attack against Japan and in situations in areas surrounding Japan.
Procedures for coordination will vary depending upon items to be coordinated and agencies to be
involved. They may include coordination committee meetings, mutual dispatch of liaison officers, and
designation of points of contact. As part of such a bilateral coordination mechanism, the SDF and U.S.
forces will prepare under normal circumstances a bilateral coordination center with the necessary
hardware and software in order to coordinate their respective activities.

**VII. Timely and Appropriate Review of the Guidelines**
The two Governments will review the Guidelines in a timely and appropriate manner when changes in
situations relevant to the Japan-U.S. security relationship occur and if deemed necessary in view of the
circumstances at that time.
(The Schedule omitted: See p. 317)

**Reference 44. The Three Principles on Arms Export, etc.**
❍ The export of “arms” needs a license from the Minster of Economy, Trade and Industry pursuant to the
Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Control Law (Law 228, 1949)(Note) and the Export Trade Control
Order (Ordinance No. 378, 1949).
Note: Now known as the Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Law.

**1. The Three Principles on Arms Export**
On April 21,1967, then-Prime Minister Eisaku Sato declared the Three Principles at the House of
Representatives’ Audit Committee meeting.
(Summary)
The Principles provide that arms export to the following countries shall not be permitted:
(1) Communist Bloc countries;
(2) countries to which arms export is prohibited under the U.N. resolutions; or
(3) countries which are actually involved or likely to become involved in international conflicts.

**2. The Government’s Unified View on Arms Export**
On February 27, 1976, then Prime Minister Takeo Miki announced the Government’s view at the House of
Representatives’ Budget Committee meeting.
(Full text)
(1) The Government’s Policy
With regard to the export of “arms,” the Government, from the standpoint of Japan as a pacifist country,
has always been dealing with the problems of arms export in a cautious manner to avoid the escalation of
international conflict. The Government will continue to deal with such matters pursuant to the following
policy and will not promote arms export.
(i) The export of “arms” to the areas subject to the Three Principles shall not be permitted.
(ii) The export of “arms” to areas other than the areas subject to the Three Principles, shall be restrained
in line with the spirit of the Constitution and the Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Control Law.
(iii) Equipment related to arms production (Export Trade Control Order, Separate Table 1, Section No.
109, etc.) shall be treated in the same category as “arms.”
(2) Definition of Arms
The term “arms” is used in different laws and regulations or in terms of application, and its definition
should be interpreted in accordance with the purpose of that law or regulation.
(i) Arms referred to in the Three Principles on Arms Export are “those that are used by the military
forces and directly employed in combat.” Specifically “arms” are those that are listed in Items from
No. 197 to No. 205 in the Annexed List 1 of the Export Trade Control Order and are consistent with
the above definition.
(ii) “Arms” under the Self-Defense Forces Law are interpreted as “firearms, explosives, swords and other
machines, equipment and devices aimed at killing and injuring people or destroying things as means
of armed struggle.” Such equipment as destroyers, fighters and tanks that move, intrinsically carrying
firearms, etc. for purposes of directly killing and injuring people or destroying things as a means of
armed struggle, are considered “arms.”
Note: Due to partial revision of the Export Trade Control Order in November 1991, “the item No.
109” in (3) of 1) and “the items from No. 197 to No. 205” in (1) of 2) have been changed to
“the Item No. 1.”

**Reference 46. The SACO Final Report**

(December 2, 1996)

The Special Action Committee on Okinawa (SACO) was established in November 1995 by the Governments
of Japan and the United States. The two Governments launched the SACO process to reduce the burden on the
people of Okinawa and thereby strengthen the Japan-US alliance.
The mandate and guidelines for the SACO process were set forth by the Governments of Japan and the
United States at the outset of the joint endeavor. Both sides decided that the SACO would develop
recommendations for the Security Consultative Committee (SCC) on ways to realign, consolidate and reduce
US facilities and areas, and adjust operational procedures of US forces in Okinawa consistent with their
respective obligations under the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security and other related agreements. The
work of the SACO was scheduled to conclude after one year.
The SCC which was held on April 15, 1996, approved the SACO Interim Report which included several
significant initiatives, and instructed the SACO to complete and recommend plans with concrete
implementation schedules by November 1996.
The SACO, together with the Joint Committee, has conducted a series of intensive and detailed discussions
and developed concrete plans and measures to implement the recommendations set forth in the Interim Report.
Today, at the SCC, Minister Ikeda, Minister Kyuma, Secretary Perry and Ambassador Mondale approved
this SACO Final Report. The plans and measures included in this Final Report, when implemented, will reduce
the impact of the activities of US forces on communities in Okinawa. At the same time, these measures will
fully maintain the capabilities and readiness of US forces in Japan while addressing security and force
protection requirements. Approximately 21 percent of the total acreage of the US facilities and areas in
Okinawa excluding joint use facilities and areas (approx. 5,002 ha/12,361 acres) will be returned.
Upon approving the Final Report, the members of the SCC welcomed the successful conclusion of the
year-long SACO process and underscored their strong resolve to continue joint efforts to ensure steady and
prompt implementation of the plans and measures of the SACO Final Report. With this understanding, the SCC
designated the Joint Committee as the primary forum for bilateral coordination in the implementation phase,
where specific conditions for the completion of each item will be addressed. Coordination with local
communities will take place as necessary.
The SCC also reaffirmed the commitment of the two governments to make every endeavor to deal with
various issues related to the presence and status of US forces, and to enhance mutual understanding between
US forces and local Japanese communities. In this respect, the SCC agreed that efforts to these ends should
continue, primarily through coordination at the Joint Committee.
The members of the SCC agreed that the SCC itself and the Security Sub-Committee (SSC) would monitor
such coordination at the Joint Committee described above and provide guidance as appropriate. The SCC also
instructed the SSC to seriously address the Okinawa-related issues as one of the most important subjects and
regularly report back to the SCC on this subject.
In accordance with the April 1996 Japan-US Joint Declaration on Security, the SCC emphasized the
importance of close consultation on the international situation, defense policies and military postures, bilateral
policy coordination and efforts towards a more peaceful and stable security environment in the Asia-Pacific
region. The SCC instructed the SSC to pursue these goals and to address the Okinawa-related issues at the
same time.

**The SACO Final Report on Futenma Air Station (an integral part of the SACO Final Report)**

(Tokyo, Japan, December 2, 1996)

1. Introduction
a. At the Security Consultative Committee (SCC) held on December 2, 1996, Mister Ikeda, Mister Kyuma,
Secretary Perry, and Ambassador Mondale reaffirmed their commitment to the Special Action
Committee on Okinawa (SACO) Interim Report of April 15, 1996 and the Status Report of September
19, 1996. Based on the SACO Interim Report, both Governments have been working to determine a
suitable option for the return of Futenma Air Station and the relocation of its assets to other facilities and
areas in Okinawa, while maintaining the airfield’s critical military functions and capabilities. The Status
Report called for the Special Working Group on Futenma to examine three specific alternatives: 1)
incorporate the heliport into Kadena Air Base; 2) construct a heliport at Camp Schwab; and 3) develop
and construct a sea-based facility (SBF).
b. On December 2, 1996, the SCC approved the SACO recommendation to pursue the SBF option.
Compared to the other two options, the SBF is judged to be the best option in terms of enhanced safety
and quality-of-life for the Okinawan people while maintaining operational capabilities of U.S. forces. In


-----

addition, the SBF can function as a fixed facility during its use as a military base and can also be
removed when no longer necessary.
c. The SCC will establish a bilateral U.S.-Japan working group under the supervision of the Security SubCommittee (SSC) entitled the Futenma Implementation Group (FIG), to be supported by a team of
technical experts. The FIG, working with the Joint Committee, will develop a plan for implementation no
later than December 1997. Upon SCC approval of this plan, the FIG, working with the Joint Committee,
will oversee design, construction, testing, and transfer of assets. Throughout this process, the FIG will
periodically report to the SSC on the status of the work.
2. Decisions of the SCC
a. Pursue construction of the SBF to absorb most of the helicopter operational functions of Futenma Air
Station. This facility will be approximately 1,500 meters long, and will support the majority of Futenma
Air Station’s flying operations, including an Instrument Flight Rules (IFR)—capable runway
(approximately 1,300 meters long), direct air operations support, and indirect support infrastructure such
as headquarters, maintenance, logistics, quality-of-life functions, and base operating support. The SBF
will be designed to support basing of helicopter assets, and will also be able to support short-field aircraft
operations.
b. Transfer 12 KC-130 aircraft to Iwakuni Air Base. Construct facilities at this base to ensure that
associated infrastructure is available to support these aircraft and their missions.
c. Develop additional facilities at Kadena Air Base to support aircraft, maintenance, and logistics
operations which are currently available at Futenma Air Station but are not relocated to the SBF or
Iwakuni Air Base.
d. Study the emergency and contingency use of alternate facilities which may be needed in the event of a
crisis. This is necessary because the transfer of functions from Futenma Air Station to the SBF will
reduce operational flexibility currently available.
e. Return Futenma Air Station within the next five to seven years, after adequate replacement facilities are
completed and operational.
3. Guiding Principles
a. Futenma Air Station’s critical military functions and capabilities will be maintained and will continue to
operate at current readiness levels throughout the transfer of personnel and equipment and the relocation
of facilities.
b. To the greatest extent possible, Futenma Air Station’s operations and activities will be transferred to the
SBF. Operational capabilities and contingency planning flexibility which cannot be supported by the
shorter runway of the SBF (such as strategic airlift, logistics, emergency alternate divert, and
contingency throughput) must be fully supported elsewhere. Those facilities unable to be located on the
SBF, due to operational cost, or quality-of-life considerations, will be located on existing US facilities
and areas.
c. The SBF will be located off the east coast of the main island of Okinawa, and is expected to be
connected to land by a pier or causeway. Selection of the location will take into account operational
requirements, airspace and sea-lane deconfliction, fishing access, environmental compatibility, economic
effects, noise abatement, survivability, security, and convenient, acceptable personnel access to other US
military facilities and housing.
d. The design of the SBF will incorporate adequate measures to ensure platform, aircraft, equipment, and
personnel survivability against severe weather and ocean conditions; corrosion control treatment and
prevention for the SBF and all equipment located on the SBF; safety; and platform security. Support will
include reliable and secure fuel supply, electrical power, fresh water, and other utilities and consumables.
Additionally, the facility will be fully self-supporting for short-period contingency/emergency


-----

operations.
e. The Government of Japan will provide the SBF and other relocation facilities for the use of U.S. forces,
in accordance with the U.S.-Japan Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security and the Status of Forces
Agreement. The two Governments will further consider all aspects of life-cycle costs as part of the
design/acquisition decision.
f. The Government of Japan will continue to keep the people of Okinawa informed of the progress of this
plan, including concept, location, and schedules of implementation.
4. Possible Sea-Based Facility Construction Methods
Studies have been conducted by a “Technical Support Group” comprised of Government engineers under the
guidance of a “Technical Advisory Group” comprised of university professors and other experts outside the
Government. These studies suggested that all three construction methods mentioned below are technically
feasible.
a. Pile Supported Pier Type (using floating modules)—supported by a number of steel columns fixed to the
sea bed.
b. Pontoon Type—platform consisting of steel pontoon type units, installed in a calm sea protected by a
breakwater.
c. Semi-Submersible Type—platform at a wave free height, supported by buoyancy of the lower structure
submerged under the sea.
5. The Next Steps
a. The FIG will recommend a candidate SBF area to the SCC as soon as possible and formulate a detailed
implementation plan no later than December 1997. This plan will include completion of the following
items: concept development and definitions of operational requirements, technology performance
specifications and construction method, site survey, environmental analysis, and final concept and site
selection.
b. The FIG will establish phases and schedules to achieve operational capabilities at each location,
including facility design, construction, installation of required components, validation tests and
suitability demonstrations, and transfer of operations to the new facility.
c. The FIG will conduct periodic reviews and make decisions at significant milestones concerning SBF
program feasibility.

**Reference 47. Basic Plan regarding Response Measures Based on the Special Measures**
**Law for Humanitarian and Reconstruction Assistance in Iraq**

(Approved by the Cabinet on December 9, 2005)
(Partially revised on December 12, 2006)

**1. Basic Principles**
On March 20 2003, the United States and other countries began to use force against Iraq as the last resort to
remove the threat posed by Iraq against peace and security of the International community. Major combat
operations in Iraq have ended, and the international community has been actively engaged in reconstruction
assistance to Iraq.
That Iraq be rebuilt as a peaceful and democratic state while maintaining its sovereignty and territorial
unity is of utmost importance not only for the people of Iraq and to peace and stability of the Middle East, but
also to securing peace and stability in the international community including Japan which depends on the
Middle East for nearly 90% of its oil imports.


-----

Japan’s aid to Iraq has consisted of two major pillars—humanitarian and reconstruction assistance being
provided by the SDF and official development assistance being extended by the Foreign Ministry. Based on the
idea, Japan has extended as much assistance as possible, on its own initiative and proactively, to Iraq, taking
into account the will of the international community expressed in United Nations Security Council Resolutions
1483 and 1511, so that Iraq will be reconstructed as early as possible by the people of Iraq themselves. Based
on the Special Measures Law for Humanitarian and Reconstruction Assistance in Iraq (Law No.137 of 2003,
hereinafter called the “Special Measures Law”), Japan dispatched SDF units to Muthanna Province and other
places in Iraq. At a time when Iraq restored its sovereignty and moved toward full-fledged restoration, which is
mentioned in U.N. Security Council Resolution 1546, Japan further supported the efforts of Iraqi people and
the international community, and enhanced its assistance so that rehabilitation of Iraq will progress steadily.
Thanks to international baking as mentioned above, an election for the National Assembly was held in Iraq
based on the newly adopted Constitution, leading to the formation of a new Government and concluding the
political process specified in U.N. Security Council Resolution 1546. In addition, the Iraqi security force has
taken root and the process of transferring security authority from the U.N. multilateral force has advanced,
marking the first step forward toward full-scale reconstruction led by the people of Iraq on their own initiative.
In the future, Japan will strive to make fruitful results of its reconstruction assistance take root in Iraq and will
try to establish relations of broad and long-term partnership with the country. In light of the continued support
of Iraq by the United Nations and the multilateral force, including the adoption of U.N. Security Council
Resolution 1723 that extends the authority of the multinational force for one year upon request of the Iraqi
transition government, Japan will carry out activities for humanitarian and reconstruction assistance and other
response measures based on the Special Measures Law.

**2. Matters Regarding Implementation of Activities for Humanitarian and Reconstruction**
**Assistance**

(1) Basic Matters Regarding Activities for Humanitarian and Reconstruction Assistance
Iraq, in the first place, was ravaged by a quarter century of oppressive rule, and development of its social
infrastructure was delayed. Its government collapsed following the use of force by the United States and
other countries in March 2003. Thus, its people were thrown into a difficult situation, making the need for
humanitarian and reconstruction assistance extremely important. In particular, in the area of medical
services, there were shortfalls regarding operation, maintenance and management of hospitals including
insufficiency in medical equipment. Regarding supply of electricity and water, supply networks at the
national level were not functioning sufficiently, becoming major issues in certain regions.
Therefore, expeditious assistance in these areas was necessary. Furthermore, in addition to assistance
to meet such short-term needs, assistance that would lead to a more full-fledged development of social
infrastructure was also necessary.
In view of such a situation, Japan conducted activities for humanitarian and reconstruction assistance,
dispatching GSDF units to Muthanna Province in Iraq in line with the Special Measures Law and having
ASDF units undertake airlifting of goods and materials used in humanitarian and reconstruction assistance
activities. Aid activities by the GSDF units in the Iraqi province continued for about two years and a half
in wide-ranging areas, from medical services and water supply to reconstruction of public facilities such as
school and roads. These assistance measures along with the provision of ODA produced visible results in
the province, such as the establishment of livelihood-related infrastructure and creation of new jobs,
basically ending the stage of assistance for meeting short-term needs. Reconstruction efforts in Iraq have
now moved to the stage in which the people of Iraq should play a leading role on their own initiative.
Under such circumstances, on June 20, 2006, Japan decided to terminate the aid mission by GSDF units of
implementing response measures to meet domestic needs in Iraq. GSDF units in charge of providing

**Reference 48. Humanitarian and Reconstruction Activities etc. by the Self Defense**
**Forces after the Restoration of Sovereignty of Iraq**

(Approved by Cabinet on June 18, 2004)

On June 8, 2004, Resolution 1546 was unanimously adopted by the United Nations Security Council. As
provided in the Resolution, the occupation of Iraq will be terminated and its sovereignty will be fully restored
on June 30.
Japan welcomes the full restoration of sovereignty of Iraq and the entering into a new phase toward fullfledged reconstruction.
Up until now, the Self Defense Forces (SDF) of Japan has been carrying out activities centering on
humanitarian and reconstruction assistance activities for the people of Iraq, based on the Special Measures Law
for Humanitarian and Reconstruction Assistance in Iraq and its Basic Plan in accordance with the Constitution
of Japan. Its activities are highly appreciated in Iraq, and there is a strong expectation for the continuation of
there activities after the restoration of Iraq.
In line with the unanimously adopted UNSC Resolution, which is based on the request of the Iraq Interim
Government to the International Community for assistance including the continued presence of the
Multinational Force (MNF), and with the understanding that the reconstruction and stability of Iraq is
important for the security and prosperity of Japan, the SDF will continue to carry out the above mentioned
activities after the restoration of sovereignty.
In this respect, taking into account that the new Resolution clearly defines that humanitarian and
reconstruction assistance activities, as have been carried out by the SDF, are included in the tasks of the MNF,
and upon sufficient deliberation within the Government on this matter, the Government has decided that the
SDF will continue its activities henceforth within the MNF.
Beyond June 30, the SDF will be in the MNF and under the unified command of the MNF, and it will
maintain communication and coordination between the command of the MNF. However, it will not be subject
to the command of the MNF. The SDF will continue to carry out humanitarian and reconstruction activities
etc., based on Japan’s own judgement and under the Japanese national command, in a manner welcomed by the


-----

Iraq Interim Government. An understanding was reached on this point, between the government of Japan and
the government of the U.S. and the U.K., which jointly proposed the draft Resolution, and which are core
members of the MNF and its unified command.
The SDF will not be engaged in any activities that may be deemed as the use of force which is prohibited
by the Constitution. It will continue its activities in so-called “non-combat areas” in accordance with the
Special Measures Law, and its activities will not become an integral part of the use of force by other States.
As explained above, SDF’s activities within the MNF will not alter the Government position regarding
participation in so-called multinational forces in a manner considered to be impermissible in regard to the
Constitution.

rescue activities and activities to assist people affected by terrorism in line with the Special Measures Law

is founded on justice and order. In order to bring about these ideals, it is essential that we ensure the continued
existence and security of a Japan that stands on the premise of democracy by protecting its peace and its
independence.
In observing the realities of the world, we find that countries are making ever greater efforts to prevent war
through international cooperation. At the same time, the development of weapons of mass destruction means
that the outbreak of large-scale war would be disastrous, and thus efforts to keep such weapons under control
are growing stronger. International disputes, however, continue unabated, with countries seeking to protect
their own peace and independence by putting in place the defense arrangements they need to serve their
continued existence and security.


-----

While retaining the sincere hope that the wisdom of mankind and the cooperation of people of all countries
will lead to a lasting world peace, the Japanese people have created the present-day SDF to protect their own
country.
The mission of the SDF is to protect the peace and independence of the country and preserve its security.
The principal task of the SDF is to prevent the occurrence of direct and indirect aggression against Japan,
and to repel any such aggression should it take place.
The SDF exist as part of the nation. In accordance with the principles of democratic government, the
Commander-in-Chief of the SDF is, as such, the Prime Minister, who represents the Cabinet, and the basic
administration of the SDF is subject to control by the National Diet.
Whether in peacetime or in the event of an emergency, SDF personnel must, at all times, be prepared to
identify themselves with the people and take pride in serving the public without regard to themselves.
The spirit of SDF personnel is founded on the healthy spirit of the nation itself. Cultivation of the self, love
of others and concern for the motherland and its people—these particular attributes provide the SDF with the
proper sense of patriotism and identification with their own people that lie at their spiritual heart.
We must remember the true nature of our role as members of the SDF, and refrain from taking part in
political activities, reflect deeply on the distinguished mission bestowed on us as members of the SDF and take
great pride in our work. By the same token, we must devote ourselves unstintingly to training and selfdiscipline and, in the face of events, be prepared to discharge our duties at risk to ourselves, acting on the basis
of the criteria below.

**1. Awareness of Mission**
(1) We will protect from external aggression the nation of Japan, its land and people, which we have inherited
from our forefathers and which we will bequeath to the next generation enriched and developed.
(2) We will safeguard the peace and order of our national life, which is founded on freedom and
responsibility.

**2. Individual Development**
(1) We will strive to make ourselves into positive and upstanding members of society who are free from
prejudice, and cultivate sound judgment.
(2) We will develop into well-balanced individuals with regard to qualities such as intellect, initiative,
trustworthiness and physical fitness.

**3. Fulfillment of Responsibility**
(1) We will go about our duties with courage and perseverance at the risk of our lives as dictated by our
responsibilities.
(2) We will be bound to our comrades by love and protect our posts steadfastly in the spirit of public service.

**4. Strict Observance of Discipline**
(1) We will be true and impartial in our observance of the law and submission to orders, in the belief that
discipline is the lifeblood of a unit.
(2) We will make sure that the orders we give are appropriate, and cultivate the habit of positive, considered
obedience.

**5. Strengthening of Solidarity**
(1) Outstanding leadership and warm comradeship will allow us to develop the confidence to endure hardship
and suffering collectively.


-----

(2) We, the Ground, Maritime and Air Self-Defense Forces, will do all we can to respond to the
responsibilities with which we are entrusted by devoting ourselves as one to ensuring the continued
existence of our country and its people.
