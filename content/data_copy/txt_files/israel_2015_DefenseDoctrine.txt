# Deterring Terror

## How Israel Confronts the Next Generation of Threats

#### English Translation of the Official Strategy of the Israel Defense Forces

 Foreword by Graham Allison

**SPECIAL REPORT**

AUGUST 2016


-----

In August 2015, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) published its first-ever

public defense doctrine. Authored by new IDF Chief of General Staff Lt. Gen.

Gadi Eizenkot, the doctrine outlines the military’s strategic and operational

responses to the main threats facing Israel.

To make this document, published only in Hebrew, accessible to the American

strategic community, the Belfer Center commissioned Susan Rosenberg to

provide an English translation.

The Center also annotated the doctrine to provide context for readers less

familiar with the Israeli national security environment. Selected annotations

are included in this print version, with the fully-annotated version available

online at belfercenter.org/IDFStrategy.

### Foreword

The U.S. is often called a “laboratory of democracy.” Each of its 50 states
address common challenges from education and public safety to promoting
economic growth. When one finds a better way to skin a cat, others can learn
from its experience. Israel might analogously be called a “laboratory of secu­
rity.” Facing multiple threats from all directions 24/7, Israeli national security
professionals have demonstrated a remarkable capacity for learning. They
experiment, recognize failures, explore alternatives, and apply lessons to the
next case. Israel’s current approach to national security thus reflects lessons
learned from many iterations of experience.

Much of Israel’s tactical and strategic thinking occurs behind a veil of secrecy.
But in 2015, for the first time in Israel’s history, Chief of the General Staff
of the Israel Defense Forces Lt. Gen. Gadi Eizenkot issued a public version
of Israel’s national security doctrine. Unfortunately, it was released only in
Hebrew. Harvard Kennedy School’s Belfer Center for Science and Interna­
tional Affairs is now pleased to be able to present an English translation.

The U.S. is not Israel. Not every security strategy that works for Israel is appro­
priate for America. But by making this document available for the American
strategic community, the Belfer Center hopes to encourage a debate about how
the lessons learned by Israel can inform and enrich our own national security
strategy. The online translation of the doctrine includes annotations to provide
context for readers less familiar with the Israeli national security environment,
as well as an article that highlights the IDF’s decision to make deterrence the
centerpiece of its strategy to prevent ISIL attacks in Israel.

### From the Office of the Chief of Staff

Many changes have taken place in the strategic environment in recent years,
which have led to changes in the nature and potency of the threat facing the
State of Israel, spreading outward from the first circle to more distant threats.
The doctrine as formulated here is based on an understanding that the con­
ventional and nonconventional threats in the first circle are on the decline
while there has been an increase in nonconventional threats (terrorist organi­
zations, subterranean infrastructure, high trajectory weapons, etc.) and cyber
threats. At the same time, we are aware that underlying the multi-year plan
is the need to build the IDF’s might both in multi-theater and in multi-di­
mensional defense and for simultaneous attacks on a number of fronts in
preparation for D-Day.

The “IDF Strategy” document presents the changes the IDF needs to
undergo in light of the future challenges and changes in the characteristics
of the enemy, such as reinforcing and improving the effectiveness of ground
maneuvers, diversifying operational capabilities in campaigns between wars,
strengthening the cyber dimension, and preserving intelligence, aerial, and
naval superiority. As to the use of the force, the strategy is based on unchang­
ing principles — deterrence, early warning, defense, defeating the enemy, and
victory. In addition, the approach sets out the command and control doctrine
for combat with the aim of enabling the effective use of the IDF’s capabilities
in the entire war theater.


-----

Dealing with the IDF’s Strategy has been part of the IDF’s operational activ­
ities for many years. The approach as formulated in this document will be
the basis for the processes that the IDF will lead within the framework of the
“Gideon” multi-year plan and will be the compass for building and operating
the force with the aim of realizing its capabilities while studying the changes in
the enemy’s characteristics and being conscious of the IDF’s might.

Formulating the strategy is not the supreme test, the proof lies in the imple­
mentation of the task in Routine, Emergencies, and War (REW). The IDF will
succeed in facing each and every task and challenge and in carrying out its
mission: to defend and to be victorious.

### Introduction

1. **The IDF Strategy document is the basis for guiding and building**

**up the use of force and deals with the following issues: [1]**

A. **How the IDF analyzes the domestic and external operational**

**environment.**

i. Describes the State of Israel’s security doctrine (as reflected

in earlier work and the way in which Israel operates.)

ii. Describes the IDF’s operational environment— international,

operative-strategic, and domestic.


B. **Strategy for the use of the force focusing on**

the common foundations of the various oper­
ational arenas in which the conflict is fought
against a substate enemy (such as Hezbollah
and Hamas). The unique context of the area of
operation needs to be developed in a parallel
process, the main point being to impose the
general principles in various situations to the
unique operative challenge in a particular
theater.

roles of the General Staff and the headquarters
of the operational theaters, defining the Chief of
the General Staff as the IDF’s sole commander of the campaign
and the principles of command and control.


D. **Principles for building up the force and the capabilities**

**needed by the IDF with prioritization in principle derived from**
an analysis of the operational environment and the principles
guiding the use of force.

1 This document is the unclassified version of the IDF Strategy document formulated within the
framework of the “Gideon” multi-year plan.


-----

2. **These are the next steps as derived from this document:**

A. Formulate an overall approach to the use of force and approaches

for using the force in the theaters of operation and having these
principles written up by the commanders of the operating force
headquarters.

B. Formulate and write up concepts for building up the force in the

divisions and branches.

C. Continue to prioritize the capabilities needed by the IDF and the

plans to fortify it as derived from the IDF Strategy — a process that
should be led by the Planning Division and the Operations Division
in collaboration with the branches and the divisions within the
framework of their preparations for the “Gideon” multi-year plan.

### Chapter 1:
 The Strategic Framework

1. The IDF Strategy is the conceptual and practical foundation for all

basic military documents. As such, it is based on vital national inter­
ests, the basic assumptions of national security, and the principles of
military thinking and action. It guides us on how to incorporate the
basic assumptions of national security into the principles and rules of
military doctrines.

##### National Objectives

2. These are the national objectives of the States of Israel:[2]

A. Secure the existence of the State of Israel, defend its territorial

integrity and the security of its citizens and inhabitants.

B. Uphold the values of the State of Israel and its character as a Jewish

and democratic state and as the homeland of the Jewish people.

C. Ensure the State of Israel’s social and economic strength.

D. Strengthen the State of Israel’s international and regional status

while striving toward peace with its neighbors.

2 From the staff work to develop a national security doctrine (Meridor document, 2007-5767)


-----

##### Threats

3. The threats facing the State of Israel are

the following: States — distant (Iran) and
nearby (Lebanon), failed states and states in
a process of disintegration (Syria); substate
**organizations (Hezbollah, Hamas); terrorist**
**organizations without links to a particular**
**state or community (Islamic Jihad, Palestinian**
Islamic Jihad, ISIS, and others).


—
IRAN

**Eizenkot on Iran:**

“Without a doubt the nuclear
deal between Iran and the West
is a turning point, historically. It
is a big change in terms of the
direction that Iran was headed
towards, and the way that we
saw things. It has many risks,
but also many opportunities
that it presents. The IDF’s role
and my role is to look at the
risk prism and the capability
prism and to judge from that—
not because we assume that
the worst-case scenario will
take place, because I think that
is as dangerous as imagining
the best case scenarios.”


##### Principles of the national security doctrine

4. The military aspect of the security doctrine—deterrence, early warning,

defense, and decision—find expression in these principles:

A. **Reliance on a defensive security strategy based on assuring Israel’s**

existence, creating effective deterrence, neutralizing threats as
necessary and avoiding confrontations.

B. **Offensive military concept — the basic assumption is that the**

enemy cannot be defeated through a defensive posture. Therefore, it
is necessary to use force in an offensive posture to achieve clear-cut
military results. The use of force will be carried out with resolve in
order to achieve the political goals while operating in accordance
with the rules of international law with an emphasis on the rules of
war,[3] and safeguarding the State of Israel’s legitimacy.

3 Rules of war are founded on basic principles whose implementation depends on the context: mili­
tary necessity, judgment, proportionality, and humanity.


-----

C. **Strategic cooperation — strengthening the**

relations with the United States and developing
strategic ties with other key states in addition to
establishing and reinforcing centers of support
around the world.

D. **Strengthening Israel’s regional status — reinforc­**

ing the peace accords and maximizing the potential
for cooperation with moderate elements in the
region.

E. **Maintaining the relative advantage based on**

human quality, advanced technological capabilities
(weaponry) and various types of intelligence.

5. Premise underlying the security concept is:

A. **Maintaining long periods of security calm to enable the devel­**

opment of society, science and the economy, and to improve the
preparedness for Emergencies and War.

B. **Creating deterrence in the regional environment and against**

elements that could become threats based on augmenting a strong
and relevant military force and resolving to use the full might of the
military force when required.

C. **During Routine — implementing, enhancing, and maintaining**

deterrence by building the force and creating a credible threat
relative to our willingness and readiness to use it. At the same time,
using all the defense organizations in coordinated action to impede
the enemy’s capabilities to build up its force.

D. **In Emergencies and War — speedily removing the threat while**

minimizing the damage to the State of Israel and enhancing Israel’s
deterrence in the region.


-----

##### The link between national goals and the use of force

6. When the political echelon finds it must use the army it should draft

the guidelines as follows:

A. What are the goals and strategic conditions necessary to end the

conflict?

B. What is the role of the army and how is it integrated into achieving

these goals?

C. In what contingencies force would be employed?

D. Defining the additional efforts (political, economic, media, social)

and the IDF’s role in relation to them.

7. Instructions from the political echelon require clarifications and

ongoing dialogue between the senior military echelon (Chief of the
General Staff) and the political echelon. The guidance from the govern­
ment is the basis for strategic thinking processes in the General Staff
but is also influenced by them — there is reciprocal impact.


-----

### Chapter 2:
 The Strategic and Operational Environment

1. In recent years there has been a change in the threat against the State of

Israel. Previously, the enemy sought to advance a vision stressing Arab
nationalism and aspired mainly to defeat Israel using regular armies,
while today the enemy carries a local, ethnic and religious banner
and has switched to actions that combine military activities, guerrilla
actions, terror, and “soft” warfare.

##### Characteristics of the international and strategic environment

2. In the environment outside Israel the following strategic logic can be

observed:

A. The enemy aspires to impose Islamic rule in the Middle East,

including inside Israel. It works to erode and exhaust Israeli society
on the assumption that its steadfastness is low.

B. The “resistance” Islamic movements aspire to replace the regimes

in the states and try to establish themselves in outlying areas where
governance is weak.

C. Problems with Western states which impact Israel’s international

legitimacy.

3. In Israel’s domestic environment:

A. Israel is a peace-seeking nation that aspires to avoid confrontations.

B. If a confrontation is forced on Israel, it will concentrate its capabili­

ties and will win.


-----

C. The changes in the national order of

priorities lead to a reduced investment in
defense in favor of social and economic
development. At the same time, the
expectation remains that there will be a
speedy resolution of conflicts and defense
against all threats.

##### Characteristics of the operational environment


—
UNREST

Doctrine is likely referring to large
protests in Israeli cities in 2011
that called for economic reforms.


4. The characteristics of the enemy’s use of force have changed and pose

new challenges for the IDF:


A. Decline in threats from regular national

armies and a rise in threats from irregular
or semiregular substate organizations
supported by Iran which aspire to become
governmental entities (a decline in the
threat of maneuvers into our territory
with a limited threat of infiltration to
carry out hostile terrorist activity or for
propaganda purposes).


—
INFILTRATION

An example of terrorist
infiltration used for propaganda
purposes is this 2014 Hamas
attack, perpetrated using a
tunnel into Israeli territory. Five
Israelis were killed and Hamas TV
released the video of the attack.


B. Increased threat of fire on the home front (volume, pace, accuracy,

size of the payload, survivability) and an attempt to create a stra­
tegic threat against national weak spots and the national economy.
This is in addition to an ongoing endeavor by the enemy to assure
the survival of its firepower through decentralization, camouflage,
protection and the use of the civilian environment to provide it
with a bargaining chip and “victory photographs.”


-----

C. The enemy is deployed and integrated in

inhabited civilian areas in order to make it more
difficult for the IDF to fight it, to increase the
attacks on noncombatants, and to hinder the
IDF’s freedom of action.

D. Combat capabilities (explosive charges, con­

ventional warheads, short-range missiles, anti-tank weapons,
surface-to-air missiles, anti-ship missiles, electronic warfare,
subconventional warfare) are aimed at deterring and disrupting
the IDF’s efforts on the ground, in the air and at sea, offsetting its
technological advantages, maximizing civilian and military losses,
and intensifying the strategic pressure on Israel.

E. A multi-dimensional approach during a campaign and between

campaigns, including cyber-attacks, public perception and legal
efforts, and terrorist activity in Israel and abroad, such as kidnap­
ping civilians and soldiers for bargaining purposes, etc.

5. In the context of operational capabilities:

A. The IDF’s costs for weapons, intelligence and defense escalate

because of the operational challenges posed by the enemy which
has significantly lower costs.

B. Ensuring the IDF’s continued technological advantage is being put

to the test due to the availability in civilian markets of some of the
technologies that used to be available exclusively to state defense
industries.

6. In its counter-fire campaigns against substate Islamic organizations, the

IDF will have to:

A. End the warfare with a victory and dictate the conditions for

ending the fighting.

B. Significantly reduce damage to the home front.


-----

C. Create an improved security situation after the fighting that makes

it difficult for the enemy to regain strength.

D. Preserve the legitimacy to use force.

7. On the military level, the confrontation will require a decision on the

best ways to integrate and prioritize the various means — defensive,
offensive, special operations, and the other support endeavors — in
order to conduct a battle that best supports the political and strategic
goals and corresponds with the resources allocated to it.

##### Other outlines that are not the focus of the doctrine

8. When assessing all the risks and opportunities, possible shifts due to

the high level of uncertainty in the region must be taken into account.

### Chapter 3:
 Deploying the IDF’s Force

1. In this chapter, we will present the general principles for the use of

force by the IDF during Routine, in War, and in Emergencies; the
principal political and strategic goals required of the IDF; the IDF’s
basic functioning situations; and the operational characteristics and
their rationale.

##### General principles for deploying the IDF’s force

2. The following are the general principles for the use of force by the IDF:

A. **Prevent confrontation and deter the enemy:**

i. A campaign to weaken negative forces, harm the enemy’s capa­

bility, and demonstrate a high and immediate level of readiness
to carry out the army’s mission — to defend and to win.

ii. Expand and deepen regional and international cooperation

against the enemies.

B. **Early warning and intelligence[4] on the enemy’s capabilities and**

**intentions:**

i. Maintain intelligence superiority that will provide sufficient

early warning on the enemy’s capabilities and intentions.

4 National intelligence — intelligence that enables the formulation of a national security strategy,
defining the reference threats and reference scenarios for building the force, that allows for optimal
utilization of resources at any point in time in accordance with developments on the ground, and
enables the shifting of resources between readiness and strengthening, as well as identifying shifts
which call for the IDF to change its deployment. This includes an ability to identify such shifts and
to respond to the concerns at all levels involving national security (not only in the military context).

Strategic intelligence — intelligence that enables the design and planning of campaigns, the draft­
ing of an achievable strategic goal in military and measurable language, which reflects the goals of
the political echelon in the war theater and is coordinated with it.

Systemic intelligence — intelligence that enables the use of force at the system-wide level (follow­
ing an analysis of the enemy’s centers of gravity) and tactical level, in order to maximize damage to
the enemy and to achieve a tactical advantage in all dimensions. This intelligence will come from all
the collection agencies up to the level of a battalion, a single aircraft or a single vessel (depending
on relevance).


-----

ii. Maintain early warning on states, substate military organiza­

tions and terrorist organizations, including identifying shifts at
all levels: strategic, system-wide, and tactical.

iii. Intelligence that enables operational planning and qualitative

harm to the enemy.

C. **Defense and protection:**

i. Defense in all four dimensions (land, sea, air, and cyber).

ii. Defense of Israel’s citizens and inhabitants, infrastructure, and

its physical integrity (securing its sovereignty).

iii. Prevent the enemy from making any territorial gain at the con­

clusion of a confrontation and reduce the enemy’s achievements
in all other dimensions.

D. **Victory and defeat:**

i. Use military superiority to achieve the objectives of the oper­

ation as defined by the political echelon in order to improve
Israel’s strategic situation.

ii. Maintain the continuity of the economic and war efforts

through effective and multi-dimensional defense (land, sea, air,
cyber).

iii. At the tactical level, defeat the enemy at every encounter.

##### The purpose of military deployment in the IDF’s functional situations

3. A number of key political and strategic goals can be defined for the use

of force:

A. **Defer the next confrontation by using force in Routine.**

B. **Maintain or improve the strategic situation after the enemy has**

started a hostile action characterized by a change in the modus
operandi and intentions.


-----

C. **Radically change the situation until there is a shift in the strategic**

balance which finds expression in neutralizing players or in a
significant change in their capabilities or status.

4. Alongside the range of operations there is a defined continuum of

military functional situations which differentiates between three situa­
tions: Routine, Emergency, and War (REW). The functional situation
is defined by the Chief of the General Staff depending on the military
situation being faced. This definition helps to express an understanding
of the confrontation on the battlefield, to conduct a dialogue with the
political echelon, to define the basic political situation, and to make
decisions on enlisting state resources:

A. A Routine situation refers to ongoing security, a limited and

ongoing confrontation, and the campaign between wars (CBW).

B. An Emergency situation refers to campaigns and limited opera­

tions that are not within a war framework.

C. A War situation.

5. IDF Strategy is based on operations that enable it to achieve what it

has set out to do. This is accomplished by organizing the tasks, the
resources, and the command authority in a way that permits optimal
action and achievement of the defined goals.

6. The IDF will respond to sudden initiated moves and will operate to find

strategic opportunities in the region.

7. Characteristics of actions in the various situations and their operational

rationale:

A. In a Routine situation — defensive and offensive activities,

creating legitimacy and nonmilitary actions aimed at reducing


-----

the enemy’s freedom of action and increasing Israel’s freedom of
action.[5]

B. In an Emergency situation — using limited military force (com­

pared to a War situation). The purpose of the use of force is to show
the futility of using force against Israel and returning to a situation
of quiet and calm without aspiring to an immediate strategic
change. Disruption to daily life on the home front will be as limited
as possible. In addition, the campaign will focus on a limited/
circumscribed achievement.[6]

C. In a War situation — use of the force in war is characterized by a

significant mobilization of military and state resources for action
together with a readiness to take high risks, and using force at a
continuous high level in order to achieve victory.

##### Campaigns in Emergency and War situations


8. The basic scenario to which this section refers

is a confrontation with substate military
organizations (such as Hezbollah and Hamas,
with the characteristics as described above).
Despite the focus of the scenario, the response
to it — approaches to the use of force and
capabilities that will be developed to build the
force — is usually also appropriate for cam­
paigns waged against armies and states.

HEZBOLLAH

**Eizenkot on Hezbollah:**

“The main rival the IDF has
at this time is Hezbollah.
That is our main rival. It is an
organization that for many
years, dozens of years, has been
building a strategic idea that is
very simple and is challenging
the intelligence, aerial and
ground superiority of the IDF.”


9. Any use of force is carried out in context, using logic and unique

operational patterns. Presented here will be two main patterns with a
rationale that is clear but different both politically and militarily, on the
basis of which concrete operational approaches can be developed for
the different battle zones.

5 Such a campaign would include all the efforts and would be conducted at the national level, and
would include legal, economic, and public perception and information campaigns.

6 Circumscribed — relative to the maximum possible achievement of a decisive victory. The achieve­
ment is circumscribed at the strategic and system-wide level. At the tactical level the achievement
required from the units will be the full achievement of a tactical victory.


-----

10. At the strategic level, in all types of campaigns, we must strive for

**victory, which means achieving the political goals decided on for the**
**campaign in a way that will lead to the improvement of the security**
situation after the confrontation.

11. The IDF will provide answers to two types of requirements from

**the political echelon: First — to achieve a complete and clear-cut**
**military victory against the military organization on the other side.[7]**
Second — to strike at the enemy in a limited and circumscribed
**manner.**

12. A campaign to achieve a victory

A. At the strategic level in the rationale for this operation is the aim is

to strive for victory by creating a situation in which a cease-fire or
political arrangement can be forced on the enemy from a position
**of strength, based on its military defeat or on its inability or lack**
of desire to continue fighting. A victory based on defeat makes an
important contribution towards creating or restoring deterrence.

B. In the operational theater and when using force a clear tactical

defeat is necessary, which will be defined by eliminating the
enemy’s desire and ability to continue fighting and operating
against our forces. The main achievements in defeating an enemy
like Hezbollah and Hamas will be:

i. Eliminating the enemy’s capability by destroying its forces.

ii. Reducing the effectiveness of the enemy’s capability against the

Israeli home front.

iii. Achieving goals that the enemy regards as being valuable.

iv. Crushing the enemy’s desire to continue fighting.

C. Furthermore, in an offensive operation significant weight will be

given to the defensive component and protecting the borders as a

7 Generally, in order to achieve a clear and obvious political victory or to destroy or seriously damage
the military capabilities of an organization or state.


-----

central element aimed at minimizing the enemy’s achievements and
increasing the IDF’s freedom of action.

D. The IDF’s principal approach to achieving victory is the maneuver

**approach.[8] This approach is based on components of pin-pointed**
offensive actions against the enemy’s weak spots, while exploiting
the relative advantages with emphasis put on momentum, speed
of action, and initiative, the combination of which achieve shock
and awe. These are designed to harm the enemy’s decision-making
process in order to disrupt the effectiveness of its operations as
early as possible both in time and in relation to the resources at its
disposal and while using minimum IDF resources.

13. Limited campaign

A. The IDF will sometimes be required to conduct campaigns in

which the achievement sought is limited or circumscribed. In most
cases, this type of campaign will result in a limited outcome in the
harm it does to the enemy with the aim of returning calm and to
serve as a deterrent in the future.

B. The operational rationale is characterized by pin-pointed and

limited operations against targets of strategic value combined with
a defensive effort and the presentation of the potential for realizing
a military victory. These actions demonstrate to the enemy the
extent of the potential damage it can expect from a deterioration
in the situation and the limited benefit its action will bring if it
does not change its policy, and will exert pressure on it to stop its
activity.[9]

C. The operational achievements of this campaign are based on a

combination of:

i. Partially neutralizing specific abilities of the enemy.

ii. Significant damage to targets of strategic value and government

institutions which contribute to the war effort.

8 The maneuver approach from the concept of maneuvering the enemy.

9 This type of activity is known as enforcement.


-----

iii. Reducing the effectiveness of the enemy’s capability against the

home front.

iv. Restraining the enemy from making a decision to employ

combat means or methods — preventing escalation by threat­
ening a response to an escalation.

D. To demonstrate the expected damage if the enemy continues to

fight it will be necessary to incorporate public perception methods
to change the enemy’s expectations.

##### Principles in the use of force in Emergency and War situations

14. The IDF operates according to principles of war and values that

embody the IDF spirit, and of these stress will be put on the principle
of persevering with the mission keeping the goal in mind, maximizing
force, and striving for victory.

15. The underlying principles in the IDF’s use of force with an emphasis on

Emergency and War situations will be based on:

A. **Quality of the commanders’ decisions and initiative.**

B. **Performing missions fully, quickly and with a minimum of**

resources.

C. **Fighting spirit of commanders and forces.**

16. In Emergency and War situations, the IDF will operate on the basis of a

number of fundamental principles that will guide the planning for the
use of force in all circumstances. Nevertheless, there will be differences
in the strength and scope in the use of the offensive force (depending
on the purpose of the force, whether it is a limited campaign or a cam­
paign to defeat the enemy), while the defensive effort at all levels will be
operated fully and completely in all types of campaign:


-----

A. **An immediate and simultaneous combined blow using two basic**

components: First — an immediate maneuver whose purpose
is to hit the enemy, conquer territory, reduce the fire from the
occupied territory, seize and destroy military infrastructures and
attack the sustainability of the enemy’s government. Second — use
**strategic and systems-wide fire based on freedom of action in the**
air and high quality intelligence.

B. **Special operations effort.**

C. **High quality intelligence to deal the enemy a significant blow**

starting with the opening of the campaign and throughout the cam­
paign, both in terms of defensive efforts to neutralize the enemy’s
offensive capabilities, and by supporting offensive countermeasures
(fire) and engaging the enemy (maneuver).

D. **Effective defense against high trajectory weapons.**

E. **War economy that permits the IDF to maximize its capabilities**

throughout all the phases of the fighting in such a way as to assure
the execution of the mission in the most effective way.

F. **Networking between a very large range of capabilities, resources,**

and knowledge.

G. **Integration between branches to maximize the IDF’s capabilities.**

H. **Flexibility in all aspects of the use of force as a means to enable**

the IDF to switch effectively between the necessary operational
situations and operational theater, and to adapt the activities to
developments in all levels of fighting.


-----

##### Main capabilities and efforts in War and Emergency situations

17. The strategic level is unique in its ability to conduct multi-discipline,

multi-theater operations, and a combined effort.[10] The efforts and the
main capabilities to be used in wartime and in emergencies for the two
purposes and using the two operational rationales described are as
follows (not in order of priority):

A. **Simultaneous defense in all operational theaters and in all**

dimensions.

B. **Offensive capability on several fronts simultaneously using:**

i. Immediate ground maneuver that is rapid, fatal, survivable,

and flexible for transfer between the theaters and fronts.

ii. Use of fire that is effective, powerful and superior, accurate,

multi-dimensional, in all theaters of war, at all times, and which
includes the element of surprise.

iii. **Deep attacks and operations that include weapons fire, focused**

maneuvers, and special operations.

C. High quality intelligence at all levels for the purpose of formulating

a national defense strategy, for designing and planning campaigns,
and for the use of force at the system-wide and tactical level.

D. Maintaining a continuous effort in the war and the economy

(home front) through a multi-layer defense (intelligence for attack,
early warning, blocking and disruption, aerial defense, fortifica­
tions, etc.).

10 **Effort (see Operations Division Doctrine and Training 1.22 dated 1 October 2014) — (at the**
campaign and military strategic levels) in the operational sphere this is a term for the temporary
unification of forces and resources under a single authority in order to carry out a mission.

Effort has three components: mission — the task imposed on the commander of the effort;
**military resources — means and sources of military force (order of battle, headquarters, and**
weaponry from various service arms) allocated to the commander of the effort to accomplish the
mission; authority — the legal power given to the commander of the effort to assign tasks to his
subordinates in order to delegate his authority to them over all the allocated resources.


-----

E. Total integration on the basis of combat networks among all

elements of the IDF force.

F. **Logistics response (economic and military) by multiple branches**

and flexible throughout the entire war theater.

G. Constant investigation and study of the strategic and operational

environment while implementing the changeability required of the
IDF.

H. Ability to conduct effective public relations and legal efforts

during and after the fighting with the aim of generating legitimacy
for the operation.

##### Details of the efforts

18. Intelligence effort for early warning before a confrontation and for

planning operations

A. Point to a risk or a threat that might materialize and call for prepa­

ration for a response.

B. Provide early warning of a surprise attack on the Israeli home front

that uses high trajectory weapons and ground infiltrations across
the border, early warning about significant change in the envi­
ronment, and early warning about technological and perceptual
changes that the enemy is preparing.

C. Intelligence for planning and conducting campaigns as required at

all levels of operation.

19. Offensive efforts: Maneuver, fire, special efforts, and cyber

Using the offensive force in War and Emergency situations for the two
purposes and the two rationales described will be based on an offensive
use of force by means of: maneuver, fire, and special efforts simultane­
ously and immediately while maximizing intelligence, command and


-----

control systems, and network capability. The basic components of these
operations are:

A. **Maneuver effort at the front and deep into the fighting zone: A**

pin-pointed ground offensive operation will be carried out against
the enemy’s centers of gravity while aspiring to speedily reach the
final lines of the fighting. When these have been reached the forces
will operate to stabilize the defense lines and sanitize the area.

B. **Firing effort: Using continuous system-wide fire power at**

maximum capacity from the moment the confrontation starts
both deep behind enemy lines and at the front. The use of fire will
be tested against the principles of proportionality and ethics, and
considerations of legitimacy will be secondary. Conducting “a
munitions economy” and using a variety of munitions in various
combinations will be a main component in planning the use of the
firing effort from the start of the fighting.

C. **Special operations effort.**

D. **Cyber effort within the framework of a War or Emergency situa­**

tion will support the defensive and offensive efforts at all levels of
fighting — strategic, operative, and tactical.

20. Defensive efforts


A. **Defense** to prevent the enemy from attaining

territorial gains in the border areas.[11] Against
organizations that are the focus of this approach,
this refers to defense against raids, attacks, and
complex terrorist attacks, including from the air
and sea. This defense capability will be based on:

i. Flexibility in using IDF forces in the border

areas.

11 Preventing a gain will be measured at the end of the defensive combat.

RESPONSIVENESS

**Amir Oren, senior correspondent**
for Israeli newspaper Ha’aretz,
summarized this approach as
such: “A basic term in Eizenkot’s
doctrine is prioritizing, giving
up the pretense of maintaining
forces for every possible need. The
Eizenkot line is the opposite of the
Bar-Lev line on the Suez Canal:
not standing outposts between
which the enemy can break
through, surround and destroy, not
desperate defense of every acre,
but forces relying on sophisticated
means used with flexibility.”


-----

ii. Reducing civilian weak spots (including

the evacuation of civilians from threatened
communities) in the border area.

iii. Collecting intelligence and early warning

systems.

B. **Protecting the home front (defense): Defense**

EVACUATIONS

IDF Brig. General (reserve)
**Michael Herzog notes**
that evacuation of civilians
represents “a departure
from the Israeli ethos.”


of the civilian home front and the military rear against high trajec­
tory weapons attack together with ensuring continuity of the attack
function, in which the order of priorities for protection will be:

i. Protection that permits the continuous use of military force

both for defense and for attack — including core systems in the
military rear and the civilian home front.

ii. Protection of vital national infrastructures and governmental

institutions in order to maintain continuity of the functioning
of state institutions.

iii. Protecting population centers.

iv. In operations that require a limited achievement, a need to give

priority to direct protection of the civilian home front will be
considered.

v. The main components in the ability to protect the home front

are effective defense, early warning systems, and physical
protection.

C. Cyber defense in Wartime and in Emergencies is vital to enable the

operation of state institutions in a confrontation and to enable the
effective operation of the IDF, which is based on networking.

21. Enabling efforts are supposed to support offensive and defensive

efforts, such as logistics and computer technology efforts.

22. National, public perception, and legal efforts to maintain and

**improve the legitimacy of the operation will begin already in the**
preparations stage and will continue during the campaign to maintain
and improve the legitimacy of the operation both in Israel and in the


-----

international community. Use will be made of domestic and external
public perception efforts, as well as efforts in the international arena at
the diplomatic level, in the media, and in the legal sphere.

##### Principles underlying the use of force during Routine

23. As stated, the goal in Routine is to maintain security, deter the enemy

from operating against Israel, and to delay the next confrontation as
much as possible by a combination of covert and overt actions.

24. Use of force during Routine includes the following actions:

A. A continuous defensive effort by Israel that enables the population

to lead a normal life (ongoing security, defending the borders and
inside the borders, cyber defense).

B. Early warning through an ongoing offensive effort (CBW). This

effort is mostly covert and undercover and incorporates a public
perception effort.

C. Civilian aid operations.

D. Creating legitimacy that would enable Israel to initiate a con­

frontation, give our forces freedom of operation while depriving
the enemy of freedom of operation during Routine, War, and
Emergency situations.


-----

##### Deterrence

25. Deterrence is created in perception but

is based also on physical and concrete
elements that constitute part of the enemy’s
considerations, such as the outcome
of previous confrontations, activities
during Routine that stress the futility of a
confrontation and constant threat of the
use of force.

26. Israel’s general and basic deterrence


—
DETERRENCE

**Amos Yadlin, the former chief of**
Military Intelligence and one of
Israel’s foremost strategic thinkers,
has explained: “Vis-a-vis Hamas and
Hezbollah, we haven’t destroyed
their capabilities, but we were able
to establish deterrence. This is
basically because we hit them hard,
and because the terrorists, in a way,
became non-full-state-entities, but
half-state entities…. The terrorists
have discovered that when they are
responsible for their economy, for
education, for the life of their people,
suddenly they are not daring to use
terror all day.”


which relies on the IDF’s advantage and
might still exists, but its relevance is more restricted than in the past
because the threat has changed.

27. Deterrence must be specific and adapted to each enemy; it must be

based on an ongoing analysis of the enemy’s characteristics, consider­
ations, capabilities, identity, and decision-making processes.

28. Deterrence against any enemy must be:

A. Without a specific context — generalized and cumulative over

**time in order to maintain the existing situation and frame “rules of**
the game” favorable to Israel.

B. In the context of a particular crisis — specific and pinpointed, in

order to force the enemy to act or to avoid acting in order to stop
deterioration in the situation and prevent war.


-----

C. These are the components of deterrence:

i. A credible threat of severe offensive operations

that will exact a heavy toll if we are attacked.
This component is based on 
a. **Building a force that is partially visible to**

the enemy, which shows our capability and
readiness to cause it damage.

b. **Public perception actions that show our**

readiness to take risks.

c. **Limited offensive actions to signal that**

the “rules of the game” have been broken
and there is a readiness to take risks.

ii. **Building a force that illustrates to the enemy**

the futility of continuing to fight (e.g. defensive
systems).

iii. **Foiling and disrupting capabilities.**

29. Many of the actions meant to deter will be carried out

within the framework of a campaign between wars
(CBW).

##### Campaign between wars (CBW)

30. The rationale behind the use of force in CBW is

to maintain and enhance the achievements of the
previous campaign in a series of secondary goals
and objectives designed to prevent war:

A. To weaken the components of the negative

forces.

B. Minimize the enemies’ abilities to strengthen

themselves.

“In the past we had the army is in one
of two situations: either prepared for
war, or at war. But at the moment this
is not the reality. We are not preparing
for war, and we’re not at war. We’re
in a different situation where we hold
a whole campaign with a different
perception that relies on intelligence
and covert and overt possibilities
to prevent the strengthening of our
opponents, to try to weaken the
enemies in a way that will not bring
about acceleration.”

-----

C. Create optimal conditions for victory in a future war.

D. Create legitimacy for Israeli action and deny a legitimate basis for

the enemy’s action.

31. Conducting operations in this framework is based on the multidisci­

pline concept (military, economic, legal, media, and political). In other
words, CBW is an expression of the idea of operations based on a single
strategic rationale.

32. The basic idea behind the use of an offensive force in CBW is a combi­

nation of:

A. **Covert and clandestine[12] action in all fronts and dimensions**

outside Israel’s borders; this policy is based on intelligence and is
directed at harming the enemy’s efforts and initiatives.

B. **Overt actions to create deterrence — underlines the limits of**

Israel’s restraint. All of this — while creating legitimacy for Israel’s
action and while maintaining an ongoing defensive effort on Israel’s
sovereignty.

33. These are the guiding principles for the use of force in CBW in the

**covert and clandestine campaign:**

A. An initiated, continuous and controlled operation in which forces

operate in a covert and clandestine manner for short periods of
time.

B. Inter-organizational cooperation both on the operational and

intelligence levels.

12 **Covert operations — operations whose outcomes are visible to the enemy and are intended and**
carried out in such a way that the identity of those behind them are hidden or have the possibility
of deniability.

**Clandestine operations — operations conducted in a way that ensures secrecy or concealment. A**
covert operation is different from a clandestine operation in that the emphasis here is on conceal­
ing the operation rather than the identity of the person behind it.


-----

C. International cooperation for the purpose of intelligence and to

thwart the enemy and to preserve the legitimacy of the IDF’s action
and to reduce the legitimacy of the enemy’s action.

D. Operating in the public perception, economic, and legal areas as

part of the effort to reduce the enemy’s capabilities and legitimacy.

E. The need for accessible and precise intelligence at all the required

levels of operation.

##### Achieving and maintaining legitimacy

34. The enemy is also active in dimensions that are not military-kinetic

and has succeeded in the past to offset the IDF’s achievements in these
fields. This campaign has both defensive and offensive aspects. It is
aimed at creating legitimacy for Israel (including freedom of action
for the IDF) and simultaneously delegitimizing the enemy (thereby
restricting its moves).

35. Modes of operation in the campaign require us to fully exploit the

expertise of the various elements within the IDF and outside it, and
to ensure the flow of information and synergy between them. These
methods include, among other things, intelligence, public relations,
professional information, psychological warfare, diplomatic and polit­
ical channels, etc. Furthermore, we should take into consideration the
state of legitimacy in assessing the overall situation and adapt relevant
components from the processes involved in building the force and
operating it.

36. The public perception effort will have three secondary efforts on the

timeline based on the functioning of the IDF:

A. **Effort during Routine is designed to build the ideal conditions**

for creating legitimacy for the IDF and international support. This
effort is fundamental and is meant to have a long-term impact, and
changes and improves the IDF’s situation and method of operation
in light of the challenges posed by the claims of those who want to


-----

delegitimize Israel’s military action, which are based chiefly on a
critical analysis of Israel’s actions.

B. **Efforts in context include activities that exist during Routine**

as part of CBW and are directed toward having a medium-term
impact. This effort advances legitimacy for IDF operational activity
in the field during a specific operation and time frame.

C. **Efforts during or after an Emergency or War, accompanying the**

operation and the efforts after it. This effort is directed at having
both a short-term impact — advancing legitimacy during the mili­
tary operation until its completion under favorable conditions — as
well medium and long term impact — preserving the operation’s
strategic achievements and freedom of action to use force again in
the area when needed.


##### Operations against states without a common border

37. This type of operation is not in the focus of

this approach but appears here because of
its uniqueness.


—
DISTANT RIVALS

Israeli military observers assess this
as a thinly veiled reference to Iran,
although historic enemies Saudi
Arabia and Iraq, among others, also
do not share a border with Israel.


38. The achievement required against states without a common border

will be based mainly on a continuous multidisciplinary action in all
situations. The purpose of the action will be directed towards a limited
concrete achievement aimed at deterring escalation.

39. The underlying idea is based on action within the CBW framework

that is supported by continuous and ongoing intelligence and takes
place using air power together with special forces. This activity is based
on covert and clandestine operations up to the point of attacking the
enemy’s efforts at strengthening its forces and its offensive initiatives in
its territory and on reducing its freedom of operation that will disrupt
and foil its capabilities and intentions.


-----

40. These principles guide the use of force:

A. Effective, accessible, and precise intelligence in all necessary opera­

tional dimensions.

B. Initiated and controlled action below the war threshold for short

periods of time.

C. Offensive action in the target country.

D. Inter-organizational cooperation — operational and intelligence.

E. International cooperation for intelligence purposes.

F. International cooperation to maintain the legitimacy of the IDF’s

operation and to reduce the legitimacy of the enemy’s action.

G. Continuous public perception effort to reduce the legitimacy of the

enemy’s action and its freedom of action up to the point of foiling
and disrupting its initiatives.

### Chapter 4:
 The Command and Control Concept and Preparing the IDF for Combat  

##### General Headquarters (GHQ)


1. The GHQ is the IDF’s supreme

headquarters and includes the
Chief of the General Staff and the
General Staff.

2. The GHQ is the only echelon in the

IDF that is in permanent contact
with the political echelon, and is
the only unit authorized to trans­
late its instructions into military
operations.


—
GHQ, TEL AVIV

(CC-BY 2.0; Dr. Avishai Teicher)


3. The GHQ is the IDF’s multi-armed strategic headquarters (HQ) and its

purpose is to command and control the deployment of IDF forces on
all war fronts and to build the IDF force.

4. **The Chief of the General Staff is the supreme commander of the**

**IDF, and commands all IDF operations through the GHQ. The GHQ**
is responsible for coordinating and synchronizing all efforts, including
those exercised by the main HQs to use force in the war theater and in
all the operational theaters.

5. The GHQ also serves as the supreme operational HQ for the operation

of ground forces.


-----

6. Operational resources are held by the GHQ and it allocates them to

the main HQs to carry out their missions according to an order of pri­
orities that depends on the missions imposed on them. The GHQ will
balance the missions imposed on the HQs with the resources allocated
to them.

7. **This GHQ responsibility cannot be decentralized or transferred to**

**the main HQs.**

##### Chief of the General Staff as battle commander

8. The Chief of the General Staff commands all IDF battlefields and

decides on all the efforts and missions imposed on the main HQs.
The Chief of the General Staff determines the concept and the way to
achieve the mission, and consequently the efforts to be made by the
main HQs and the reciprocal relations between them.

9. The Chief of the General Staff commands the campaign through the

main HQs, which exercise various efforts. These efforts could be inde­
pendent, that is, operated by a single HQ or through a combination of
several HQs (multi-HQ). There are reciprocal relations between efforts
which are regulated as part of the battle command and control.

10. An appropriate command and control architecture must be built

**for each campaign. The command and control architecture will be**
planned in a way that maximizes the use of force. The command and
control architecture will make use of the IDF’s capabilities through
independent efforts and in combined efforts. That is why it should be
planned in the standard operating procedure, be decided on at the
outset of the event (“transition from plan to order”), be examined
during the course of the event, and even be changed if necessary.


-----

##### Main headquarters (HQs)

11. Campaign arenas are areas of operation allocated to the commanders

of the main HQs. These commanders have overall responsibility for
achieving the missions in their areas of responsibility.

12. Commanders of the main HQs are required to exercise their authority

over the operational arenas under their authorities and the three
states of Routine, Emergency and War. Within this framework they
are expected to fulfill two basic missions: One, to defend Israel’s sov­
**ereignty in their (geographic/dimensional) area, and two, to develop**
**operational know-how on the area for which they are responsible in**
all its aspects.

13. It is the responsibility of the main HQ to develop know-how in

wide-ranging connections both for itself and for the other main HQs.
The process will be implemented as a collaborative effort by the HQs.

##### Principles of command and control 

14. Mission command — is the basis for the command and control

concept and must be maintained despite the multiplicity of means of
command and control and information flow processes between the
various levels.

15. Uniformity of command — each commander is subject to the

authority of one commander at any point in time. Orders will be given
according to the chain of command and on the principle that the last
order is the decisive one — and the superior officer has the authority to
revoke an order of his subordinate.

16. Defining the mission — the command echelon defines: mission,[13]

**resources, command authority.**

13 Constraints of implementation will always be defined within the framework of the mission, among
them time and the borders of the arena.


-----

17. Consolidated command and control processes in the IDF — the

processes and management of combat procedures will be uniform
throughout the IDF and will be based on the basic combat doctrine of
the IDF and on a simple and clear common language.

18. Creating optimal conditions — each level of command has the

responsibility to create for its subordinate ranks the optimal condi­
**tions to carry out the mission by optimal planning of the force and**
its operation, allocation of resources, and reducing the constraints.
Within this framework the area of responsibility of each commander
(in the home front and in deep operations) should be limited in order
to enable him to focus on fulfilling his missions.

19. Decision making in the course of the fighting — each commander

has the possibility and the duty to make decisions that differ from the
initial planning in the course of the fighting.

20. Dialogue between commanders, HQs — great importance is given to

a constant process of dialogue between commanders and HQs aimed at
developing shared knowledge, war games, study sessions and exercises.
All these can create a joint infrastructure that will serve as a basis for
D-Day. The dialogue will take place on the principle of transparency of
information and hierarchy of command.


-----

### Chapter 5: Building the IDF’s Force

1. The purpose of the military force is to defend the integrity of the State

of Israel, provide security for its inhabitants, and enable the political
echelon to advance its national security policy and the state’s vital
national interests. In the military sphere, these objectives will be
achieved through the IDF’s ability to deal with threats, deter Israel’s
potential enemies, prevent and foil developing threats and defend the
strategic and civilian home front.

2. Building the force is aimed at creating the capabilities needed to fulfill

the IDF’s mission and use it against its enemies, and in that way, build­
ing the force contributes to deterrence and shapes the characteristics of
the fighting in the future.

3. The goals for building the force are readiness, which is the ability of the

forces and units to meet the goals of operation, and buildup, which is
the future capability of the force. Building the force is subject to tension
between the defense needed and restrictions on the resources, and
between slowness of buildup and the speed of changes in the strategic
and operative environment.

##### Guiding principles for building the force

4. The guiding principles for building the force combine the principles

for operating the force as stated above, as well as additional principles
which are unique to building the force.


-----

##### Building the IDF’s relative advantage 

5. In order to develop a capability to overpower the enemy, the IDF needs

to develop these components:

A. Maneuvering.

B. Effective use of fire.

C. Maximizing good quality intelligence to cause significant damage

to the enemy.

D. Defense against high trajectory weapons.

E. Networking.

F. Consolidated command and control processes throughout the IDF.

G. Maintaining the appropriate order of forces in the IDF.

H. Learning processes in the course of the fighting.

I. Maintaining and developing technological capabilities (basic or

preliminary) and infrastructure, which will enable expansion
within a short period of time in order to provide answers to unan­
ticipated strategic changes.

6. Building the force must be developed through these actions:

A. Develop an overall concept to operating the force in the war zone

in addition to concepts to operating the force in the operational
arenas adapted to the rapid changes in the characteristics of the
threats and the fighting.

B. Strengthen the ability to identify changes and to change in the

course of the confrontation by means of these actions:


-----

i. Training and exercises to strengthen the independence, initia­

tive, and creativity of the commanders.

ii. Learning processes in the midst of the fighting.[14]

C. Accelerate the rate of development, replenishment and assimilating

new technological solutions while taking risks to shorten develop­
ment time by these actions:

i. Increasing off-the-shelf procurement of existing products.

ii. Develop technological infrastructures that will enable adapting

the solution to the problem over time and not at the outset.

iii. Networking that supports the operation of the force.

D. A high level of capability to change in accordance with developing

problems based on a high level of basic fitness and the ability to
change directions in development and replenishment in the wake
of the development of threats and changes in the order of priorities
not foreseen at the outset.

##### Planning and implementing the building of the force

7. The force will be built on the basis of compatibility between the

different fields in building the force and reaching a full operational
capability:

A. Concept and doctrine — the cornerstone of each capability

required.

B. Weaponry — emphasizing components of the order of battle

(ORBAT) and inventory.

C. Infrastructures.

D. Personnel development.

14 IDF networking enables it to disseminate learning process insights during the fighting faster than
the enemy, which is limited in its ability due to its need to conceal communication.


-----

E. IDF organization.

F. Training (exercises and training) — the basis for skills and

capabilities.

##### Utilization of resources

8. The IDF as an organization, and IDF units in all their missions, operate

under a permanent constraint on resources which is accentuated in
Emergencies and Wartime. Dealing with this limitation has a number
of aspects: Utilization of resources through multi-year planning,
creating a basis for inter-organizational and inter-state cooperation in
the development of weapons, and the development of weapons with the
highest possible number of characteristics.[15]

##### Critical mass

9. Building capabilities will be carried out by creating or maintaining a

critical mass.[16] In addition to the importance of achieving a qualitative
and technological advantage, the quantity of means that can be
operated is very important. Quantity impacts quality and flexibility in
operation. Mass together with flexibility is the way to deal with uncer­
tainty over future challenges on the battlefield.

##### Prioritization in principle in building the force

10. As a rule, building the force will focus on a War scenario and will be

adapted as required to Emergency and Routine. Designated capabilities
for a scenario that is not War will be as restricted as possible and will
include the essential components to assure normal civilian life in
Routine.

11. The force building process presented in this chapter is directed toward

a concrete scenario of fighting a sub-state enemy. At the same time,

15 General development — suitable for a wide range of uses by different consumers.

16 [Translator’s note: Footnote missing]


-----

technological infrastructures will have to be developed in order to
respond to strategic changes in the arena, which if they take place, will
require reprioritization of capabilities.

12. The IDF’s order of priorities in principle will continue to be to develop

**offensive capabilities before defensive capabilities despite the central­**
ity of defense and overcoming threats to the home front.[17]

##### Core capabilities required by the IDF

For the sake of convenience and coherence of the discussion, we will
present the capabilities in this format:

**Attack** **Defense**

An assault ORBAT enables ground Defensive capabilities enable:
operations by:

                           - Defense of the borders in

 - Ground maneuvers Emergency and War

 - Firepower capabilities - Defense of the borders in Routine

 - Special operations - Defense against high trajectory

 - CBWs weapons

**Defense and attack in cyberspace**

Capabilities enable:

 - Utilization of intelligence

 - Continuity of performance

 - Networking enabling cooperation

 - Logistics response

 - Investigation and learning

 - Operating in a coalition

 - Influence on perception

 - Achieving legitimacy

 - Legal response

##### Capabilities needed in the field of defense

13. It is necessary to have simultaneous defense capability in all the oper­

ational arenas, in all Routine, Emergency and War situations and in all
dimensions (ground, air, sea, and cyber). The IDF’s primary mission is
to defend Israel’s territorial integrity and sovereignty.

14. The order of priorities to deal with the threats on the borders:

A. Prevent the enemy from making a territorial gain at the end of the

confrontation.

B. Foiling terror and attacks on the borders.

C. Defense against high trajectory weapons and precision fire, includ­

ing statistical fire in large numbers.

D. Defend air, sea, and cyber space.

E. Foil mega-attacks.


##### Defending the borders in Emergencies and War

15. The pinpointed threat in this field is an

attempt at infiltration and occupying
Israeli territory, on the ground,
subterranean, and by air and sea.

##### Defending the borders in Routine


16. The border area should be considered a —

permanently threatened area. The threat REINFORCING THE BORDER
includes advanced capabilities (anti-tank, In December, the Israeli military

fortified the border with Lebanon

ground-to-air missiles, high trajectory with new concrete barriers, in

anticipation of a Hezbollah attack.

weapons, etc.) which make it possible to
harm our forces from a large distance.
Therefore, preparations must be made to defend our forces and the
communities in the area adjacent to the border in a number of ways.


##### Defense against high trajectory weapons

17. High trajectory weapons are the dominant component in the enemy’s

offensive capabilities. The threat includes harm to the civilian home
front, strategic damage to national infrastructures, and damage to mil­
itary installations and the deployed military units. Building the force in
this field will be based on these actions:

A. Continuous integrated defense[18] capable of dealing with a high

flow of threats, which combines “soft” and kinetic capabilities to
neutralize the enemy’s precision firepower systems.

B. Maximum defense of strategic assets on the ground and offshore.

C. Ability to create operational control over a large area in order to

suppress fire directed from it.

D. Pinpointed early warning on launchings.

##### Capabilities needed in the field of attack

18. There must be an offensive capability on a number of fronts

**simultaneously.**

18 Integrated defense — defense based on multiple layers and capabilities from various fields.


-----

A. Carry out a simultaneous and highly powerful attack on the

ground, in the air and at sea in an integrated manner in the relevant
operational theaters.

B. Shifting air and intelligence efforts between the theaters.

##### Ground maneuvering

19. Ground maneuvering capabilities are required. A distinction will be

made between two types of maneuvering.

A. Deeply focused maneuvering to political/governmental centers of

gravity.

B. Decentralized and simultaneous maneuvering against the enemy’s

wide tactical deployment.

20. Building the force will be carried out through coordination between

the ground, air, and sea arms and by utilizing maneuvering to expose
the enemy and cause damage through the use of accurate firepower.
Building the force will focus on lethality, mobility, and survivability
of the force. Building the force in this area will be based on these
capabilities:

A. Employing a lethal maneuver with a low attrition rate by using

advanced defense systems.

B. In terms of ORBAT, time, and depth:

C. Operating a ground force in any available ORBAT at the outset of

the fighting[19] and gathering forces for a full offensive across a time

19 The purpose of the maneuvering (even if limited in scope and making do with seizing controlling
positions close to the border) is to create immediately a situation on the ground that “neutralizes”
the obstacles to carrying out a ground maneuver and creates a feeling of pursuit by the enemy, on
the one hand, while on the other — makes it possible to retreat to the border line and prevent an
escalation in the sector, if such a decision is made.

This competency calls for practice, decentralized command and control that will enable the
commander to analyze the situation and decide in real time, HQ fitness, and provides enabling
instruction to commanders, and the appropriate routine orders (e.g., in a kidnapping incident).

axis while maintaining a logistics capability that allows for action
over time.

i. Use of effective supporting firepower against an entrenched

enemy with high availability, operating air support at short
ranges and small safety ranges.

ii. Building the force on the ground in a differential manner. Pref­

erence will be given to the IDF’s vanguard divisions.

##### System-wide fire

21. It is necessary to have the capability to operate effective system-wide

**firepower (air, ground, and sea) in each war theater, at full strength,**
with any force, at any time, and with a capacity to hit thousands of
targets in a single combat day, and for the rest of the time — the ability
to attack hundreds of targets in a day. Three characteristics for use of
fire:

A. **Fire at pre-planned targets —** building the force will enable an

accurate multi-dimensional burst of fire, in the shortest time possi­
ble and at a large bank of targets. The objective of building the force
in the northern arena: tens of thousands of targets, the objective for
building the force in the Gaza arena: thousands of targets.

B. **Fire at targets of opportunity —** the ability to use intelligence and

disseminate it over short periods of time to the fire range. Building
the force will make operational processes possible starting with col­
lecting and processing data, setting up the target and attacking it,
and damage assessment. This requires a high speed network which
combines multi-dimensional fire, ground and air data collection,
processing and prioritizing engines, advanced planning tools and
wide dissemination in all units.

C. **Fire to support maneuvering —** synergy must be created between

air, ground, and sea firepower and ground forces by means of
supporting operational systems, a consolidated network, and joint
exercises which will lead to trust between the parties and permit
attacks with small safety ranges.


-----

i. Ability to launch a surprise burst of massive fire within several

hours.

ii. Strengthen the planning and control entities and base them on

manpower that is available at short time periods.

iii. Use quality intelligence that supports the use of fire against stra­

tegic targets.

iv. Joint exercise and getting to know one another in order to

create inter-branch trust.

v. Develop fire capability to damage all the above types of targets.

##### Infantry ORBAT incursion from the air

22. The ability to parachute or fly in infantry forces for an incursion onto

the enemy’s centers of gravity will be built. The purpose of building the
force includes the following capabilities:

A. Flying a significant infantry ORBAT (helicopters and aircraft with

high survivability).

B. Autonomy for the force’s activities, without logistics.

##### Deployment of special forces deep behind enemy lines

23. A capability to carry out special operations deep behind enemy lines

and on a wide scale will be built.

A. Planning and implementation of the special operations in the war

theaters and in the operational theaters.

B. Carry out an “unplanned operation.”

C. Build a “bank” of pre-prepared special operations.


-----

D. Standardize special means, weaponry and combat doctrine

(common language), among all special units, in support of imple­
mentation of large ORBAT special operations.

##### Building capability for CBW

24. Building the force for CBW is required in order to give freedom of

operation to the existing and developing operation while maximizing
the use of the existing capabilities. As a rule, building the force for
CBW is included in the building of the overall force in the IDF. In a
pinpointed context, it is necessary to act as follows:

A. To set up a coordination center for CBW operations in the

Operations Branch, to include inter-organizational and inter-min­
isterial elements.

B. Develop capabilities for covert and clandestine operations for CBW

use.

##### Building cyberspace capability

25. Cyberspace is another area of combat. Defense, intelligence collection,

and assault activities will be carried out in this space. Building the IDF’s
force in this sphere will be based on these actions:

A. Establish a cyber arm that will constitute the main HQ subordinate

to the Chief of the General Staff to operate and build the IDF’s
cyber capabilities and will be responsible for planning and imple­
menting combat in cyberspace.

B. Develop technological capabilities for cyber defense of all oper­

ational systems and defense capabilities of the support systems
(manpower, logistics).


-----

##### Building enabling capabilities

26. Develop a uniform joint language for command and control in all

IDF HQs that operate or function in the inter-arm sphere. Building the
force in this field will be based on the establishment of the principal
school for command and control.

27. Develop the capability to use quality intelligence at all levels of

operation: national intelligence, strategic intelligence, and operational
intelligence. Building the force in the field of intelligence will be based
on these actions:

A. Develop and refine the ability to integrate information from all

sensors, in all dimensions and all disciplines, to create information
systems communications in large areas and with the required
output.

B. Develop the ability to hold onto contiguous territory based on

integrating intelligence information from various disciplines which
enable the creation of targets with high accuracy and in short time
periods.

C. Monitor the enemy’s combat doctrine with emphasis on advanced

means.

D. Utilize the intelligence, analyze it, and make it accessible (as

needed) to all levels: from the GHQ, the district command, to the
tactical levels in the battalions and the commands that operate the
force.

E. Present a picture of the status of the enemy’s formations and

measure the effectiveness of the IDF’s offensive efforts against them.

28. Maintain continuity of the war and economic effort through

multi-layer protection. Building the force for developing capabilities
supporting continuity of functioning will be based on these actions:


-----

A. Protection for national and strategic infrastructures.

B. Continuous operation of the economic and war effort through the

effective protection of strategic military infrastructures.

C. Protection and maintaining a routine of REW in the home front

(few casualties on the home front):

i. The ability to respond quickly to the site of an incident based on

networking all rescue and communications services with civil­
ians and the local authorities.

ii. Selective early warning to the home front that permits the

highest focus on the hit area and maintains a normal routine in
most of the areas that are out of range.

D. Ability to operate under cyber-attack.

29. Networked combat capability by all firepower elements in the IDF

enables lethal utilization of accurate fire and creates synergy between
fire and maneuver against various enemies using a range of tactics.

30. Combining information collection networks and simultaneous air,

ground, and sea fire to enable the IDF to create superiority even against
a concealed enemy. Building the force in the field of network capability
will be based on the following:

A. A high-speed network infrastructure that enables multi-arm and

inter-organizational sharing of information.

B. Networking that enables rapid integration of information from

various disciplines and its processing into targets in short time
periods.

C. Make the appropriate information accessible to each level.

D. Manage uniform information databases and geographic infrastruc­

tures throughout the IDF, which are continuously being updated in
all the operational systems.


-----

31. Maintain a multi-arm and flexible logistic response (economic and

military) in all REW situations for all the arms and branches and in all
aspects.

32. Logistic capability that enables ORBAT ground maneuver, while over­

coming the threat of high trajectory weapons fired at the Israeli home
front and the threat of guerrilla warfare threat along the arteries.

A. Speedy organization for maneuvering of vanguard divisions.

B. Logistic supplies.

C. Mobility between the theaters.

33. The ability to impact the shaping of perception in all the circles

associated with the conflict is required by using system-wide measures.
Focused attention on developing capabilities in the perception-infor­
mation effort as follows:

A. Develop a well-ordered approach to impacting the enemy’s percep­

tion in all REW situations.

B. Ability to plan and synchronize the perception effort with the

other government ministries (Prime Minister’s Office, Ministry of
Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Justice, etc.).

34. Ability to manage effective public relations and legal efforts during

Routine, and during and after combat in order to enable the IDF to
achieve its goals, including legitimization of its actions. Building this
force should take into account the power of the media through mecha­
nisms operating in the short term and by planning and synchronization
between operations on the battlefield, the perception-public relations
effort and the legal effort. Focusing efforts on developing capabilities to
achieve legitimacy will include these actions:

A. Operational planning supported by legal knowledge.


-----

B. Strengthen mechanisms for inter-ministerial (Ministry for Foreign

Affairs, Ministry of Justice, etc.) cooperation in order to shorten
decision-making and response times.

C. Cooperation with states with similar interests.

##### Risk management for scenarios that are not the focus of the doctrine

35. Although the concept is focused on a sub-state enemy, the IDF must

also consider the capabilities needed in the face of extreme scenarios
that are not part of the referenced concept in order to manage risks,
which on the one hand will focus building the force on the referred
scenario, and on the other — will not expose Israel to unreasonable
risks to its existence.

##### Developing capabilities against states without a common border 

36. In the face of the challenge to uphold its qualitative advantage, the IDF

will maintain the safeguarding of basic readiness, based on a balance of
deterrence, while preserving mechanisms to speed up procurement.[20]
Building the force in this context will be based on these actions:


A. Strengthening strategic and tactical deterrence

via cyber warfare.

B. Early warning intelligence at suitable periods of

time for launching a preventive strike.

C. Preemptive strike capability in accordance with

early warning indications in order to foil an
attempted attack on Israel.

### Conclusion

1. Developments in the region lead the IDF to deal with a broad range

of threats that challenge its operating concept and the processes for
building the force derived from this concept. The main change is the
development of the sub-state enemy, such as Hezbollah and Hamas,
and threats from states that do not share a border with Israel.

2. This document provides the approach in principle to operate the force

in contexts that are common to all operational theaters against a semistate enemy and in the IDF’s various functional situations: Routine,
Emergency, and War.

3. The document of principles for building the force is derived from these

principles for operating the force. These principles should serve the
IDF’s force building elements when planning how to strengthen the
IDF in the coming years.

4. This document requires the necessary follow-up action, the main one

being the development of special operational concepts in the battlefield
and developing operational concepts for the operational theaters and
the commands that operate the force. At the same time, the force
building elements must formulate special force building concepts
derived from this document.

5. The IDF has always based its power on the quality of its people and the

deep understanding that the IDF is the guarantor of Israel’s national
existence. Therefore, the IDF will take steps to provide defense for the
state in all situations, by utilizing the basic qualities of its commanders
and fighters, chief among them being: fighting spirit, initiative and
quality of action, and carrying out missions fully and in an uncompro­
mising manner.
