This is a highly commendable achievement. But despite assurances, terrorist activities in Jammu and Kashmir and other parts of the country continued to be sponsored and supported from across the country.

 1.13 There has been marked improvement in the security situation in some States of the North Eastern region. However, continued violence by some insurgent groups and their reported cross border links in some States, such as Assam and Manipur is a matter of concern. The armed forces therefore, continue to be deployed in aid to civil authorities in some area of the

 1.14 The extremist activities of ‘Maoist/ Naxalites’ have the potential for causing internal security problems in some areas of certain states. In this context, funding through illegal fl ows and possible links indulging in arms and smuggling are also matters of concern. The Government is following a holistic security-cum- development oriented approach to deal with the problem.

Moreover, a large number of Indians serve in the countries of the Middle East and South East Asia - both regions with whom we share ancient civilisational ties. The safety and stability of the region is not only a matter of our security and energy needs but also one of umbilical linkages with India.

 1.16 The energy situation is in a state of instability. We are expecting a steep rise in competition as the dependency increases along with the prices. We also have a vital stake in the security of the sea-lanes to our East and West. The Bay of Bengal is a region rich in natural gas and oil and could impact on the future energy calculations.

 1.17 Today there are more challenges than opportunities to world peace and regional security. As the world continues to shrink and get more and more interdependent due to globalisation and advent of modern day technologies, peace and development remain the central


###### agenda for India. With a steadily growing economy, India has a vital stake in a safe and secure world. India and Indians have increasingly become drivers of global growth and prosperity. We understand a strong defence force is a necessary pre- requisite for growth, stability and peace. India has been committed to prepare its level of defence preparedness to deter any type of threat both conventional as well as unconventional. During the year we have also contributed several troops to the United Nations in support of peace across the world. In the year gone by, India has made signifi cant progress in expanding her defence cooperation with like-minded countries and has enhanced her ties with several countries across the world from within the Asia Pacifi c region to Europe, Americas and the African subcontinent not only to enhance the security environment of the region but also the global security scenario in order to maintain world peace, promote socio- economic collaboration and the overall development for the common good of all the people around the world.

 2.1 After independence Ministry of Defence was created under the charge of a Cabinet Minister, and, each Service was placed under its own Commander-in-Chief. In 1955, the Commanders-in-Chief were renamed as the Chief of the Army Staff, the Chief of the Naval Staff and the Chief of the Air Staff. In November 1962, a Department of Defence Production was set up to deal with research, development and production of defence equipment. In November 1965, the Department of Defence Supplies was created for planning and execution of schemes for import substitution of defence requirements. These two Departments were later merged to form the Department of Defence Production and Supplies.  In 2004, the name of Department of Defence Production and Supplies was changed to Department of Defence Production. In 1980, the Department of Defence Research and Development was created. In 2004, the Department of Ex-Servicemen Welfare was created.

###### 2.7 Jointness within the Services: One of the primary objectives of HQ IDS is to promote jointness within the Services. Jointness is aimed at obtaining optimal operational and cost effectiveness in the current and envisaged future geopolitical environment. It will also enable the services to operate seamlessly with common understanding of missions and joint strategies to accomplish them. This would entail bringing about transformation and reforms within the armed forces. The vertical and horizontal aspects of integration have been identifi ed and are being put into place in an organized and logical manner through the establishment of inter-service committees, functioning in and with HQ IDS.

 2.8 HQ IDS has achieved a number of milestones within a short span in promoting the concept of jointness within the services. 


###### 2.6 Integrated Defence Staff (IDS) was created on October 1, 2001 as a sequel to the decision by the Group of Ministers based on Kargil Committee Report. The staff of HQ IDS is provided from three Services, MEA, DRDO, Armed Forces HQ (AFHQ) Civil Services and DoD. IDS is presently functioning as staff in the advisory mode to the Chairman COSC, and is headed by Chief of Integrated Defence Staff to Chairman COSC (CISC).

 3.18 The contours of our security challenges are numerous and varied. To the military complexities arising out of the problems of unsettled borders, the challenges of the proxy war in Jammu & Kashmir, the insurgency in the North East and the growing Naxal menace in Central India, the ever enlarging spectre of terrorism and numerous non-military threats to our security have also been added.

###### efence Research & Development Organisation (DRDO) is fully dedicated towards progressive enhancement of
# D 
###### self-reliance in defence systems and also to enhance R&D infrastructure and capability of the country.


###### 8.1 The Defence Research & Development Organisation (DRDO) has come a long way since its inception on January 1, 1958 to become a major Science & Technology force to reckon within the country. It has grown multi-dimensionally and emerged as a strong and mature organisation with a vast network of 50 laboratories spread across the country.  Supported by a large pool of committed manpower and with an established high- tech research and development, production eco-system, DRDO has to its credit today a wide range of strategically signifi cant defence equipment and technologies, which are in use by the Armed Forces.

 8.2 The fi rst decade up to 1970s was a phase of providing planning and advisory services and of learning by doing and setting up science laboratories. It was also a phase of meeting short-term requirements of the users to maintain, substitute or improve the imported defence equipment. Initially, DRDO was engaged in the development of small arms and ammunitions. Subsequently, in the second decade during 1970-80, it started work in reverse engineering and started gaining know-how of system engineering. Many infrastructure and facility projects got into action during this period. 


###### 8.3 During 1980s, thrust was given to major programmes like development of guided missiles, electronic warfare systems, aircrafts, communication systems, radars, sonars, etc. These programmes gave a new impetus to multiple design and technology centres, which resulted in productionisation of weapon systems during 1990s. The Department of Defence Research and Development came into existence in 1980. It has mission to design, develop and lead to production of state-of-the-art weapon systems, platforms and allied equipment and also to provide combat support for meeting the current requirements of the Armed Forces. The Organisation is fully dedicated towards progressive enhancement of self-reliance in defence systems and also to enhance R&D infrastructure and capability of the country. It has vision to promote the corporate strength and to make the country independent of foreign technologies in critical sphere and also to act as a reservoir of expertise in most sensitive scientifi c and technological domains. DRDO plays signifi cant roles, like providing scientifi c and technological advice to the MoD in support of defence policy; as evaluator of defence equipment for the military operational requirements; and generating new technological knowledge to

###### be transferred for development of state- of-the-art weapon systems by the defence industries. The Organisation also advises the Government to make technical assessments of international security threats and the military capabilities of both current and potential adversaries. 

 8.4 Today after 50 years of its existence, DRDO is one of the fi nest models of R&D organisations in the whole world.

 ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE

 8.5 The Department of Defence Research & Development is headed by the Secretary to the Government of India, who is also Scientifi c Adviser to Raksha Mantri (SA to RM). The Secretary is assisted by the Chief Controllers Armaments & Combat Engineering and Naval Systems (ACE&NS); Missiles & Strategic Systems (MSS); Aeronautics & Materials Science (AMS); Services Interactions (SI); Life Sciences & Human Resources (LS&HR); Electronics & Computer Sciences (ECS); Resources & Management (R&M). The Organisation has two tier systems, viz. the Technical and Corporate Hqrs at New Delhi; and laboratories/establishments, regional centers, fi eld stations, etc. located at different stations all over the country.

 8.6 DRDO Headquarters : DRDO Hqrs, under the Department of Defence Research & Development, is organized in two different types of Hqrs Directorates. Technical Directorates include Directorates of Aeronautics; Armaments; Naval Systems; Combat Vehicles and Engineering; Electronics and Computer Sciences; Materials; Interaction with Services for


###### Business; International Cooperation; Technology Acquisition; Missiles; Naval Research and Development; Life Sciences; Civil Works and Estates; and Technical Examination Cell. These Directorates act as ‘single window’ to facilitate laboratories and establishments, functioning under them, in obtaining approvals of new projects from the Government, facilitate in monitoring and review of ongoing projects and also to co-ordinate with other laboratories and directorates. Besides these, Scientifi c Advisers to Chief of the Army Staff (COAS), Chief of the Air Staff (CAS), Chief of the Naval Staff (CNS) and Deputy Chief of Integrated Defence Staff also act as Technical Directors to render services to their respective Chiefs. Corporate Directorates, like Directorates of Personnel; Human Resource Development; Materials Management; Planning & Coordination; Management Services; Rajbhasha and Organisation & Methods; Budget, Finance & Accounts; Security & Vigilance; Extramural Research & Intellectual Property Rights; Public Interface; and a Center for Technology Extension & Cooperation assist laboratories in improvement of their infrastructure, creation of new facilities, induction of manpower, answering Parliament Questions, coordinating with other ministries/departments, etc. and also in getting Government approvals for taking up projects in their respective areas. Recruitment and Assessment Centre (RAC) and Personnel Assessment Centre (PEACE); undertake fresh recruitments and assessment on periodic basis for the promotions of scientists and technical staff for all laboratories & Hqrs of DRDO under Defence Research Development Service

###### (DRDS) and Defence Research Technical Cadre (DRTC), respectively.

 8.7 DRDO Laboratories/ Establishments: DRDO executes various programmes/ projects through a network of fi fty laboratories/establishments, fi eld stations, regional centres of military airworthiness, etc. located all over the country. These are engaged in R&D activities in the fi eld of aeronautics, armaments, missiles, combat vehicles, advanced computing & networking, electronic warfare, life sciences, advanced materials, composites and underwater sensors/weapons and warship technology. DRDO has two societies, namely Aeronautical Development Agency (ADA) and Society for Integrated Technology Applications & Research (SITAR).  ADA was set up in 1983 at Bangalore and has mission to undertake design & development of advanced technology aircraft. SITAR designs digital components and devices required for various projects including high performance computing. Defence Institute of Advanced Technology (DIAT), earlier an establishment of DRDO, attained status of Deemed University in 2005. The Institute organizes courses on vide spectrum of technologies including regular long and short term courses for newly recruited scientists and Post Graduate Programmes to meet defence requirements in general and weapon systems in particular. These are also administered and funded by the DRDO. Gallium Arsenide Enabling Technology Centre (GAETEC) at Hyderabad is a foundry, set up for design, development and fabrication of critical microwave components for various programmes


###### undertaken by DRDO and Department of Space.

 HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT (HRD)

 8.8 DRDO has adopted a dynamic and systematic approach for Manpower Development. A Human Resource Consultative Body has been constituted in DRDO to look into an integrated approach for development of HRD related policies and strategies for implementation in organisational system. A Manpower Planning Board manages the Scientifi c, Technical, Administrative and Allied Cadres. Through various mechanisms like optimization of cadre structure, incentive schemes, enhancement of capabilities by implementation of DRDO training policy, enhanced promotional opportunities and exit interviews, the organisation has endeavoured to ensure optimum utilization of human resource, apart from attracting and retaining young talent.

 8.9 Every year, scientists are recruited through an annual competitive examination at national level called Scientist Entry Test (SET). In addition to this, talents are also searched through campus interview, scholarship schemes through Aeronautic Research and Development Board (ARDB) and Ph.D. scholars under Registration of Student with Scholastic Aptitude (ROSSA).

###### ESM. The major placements done are as under:
 (a) Security Agencies: The DGR empanels/ sponsors ESM run private security agencies for providing security guards to various CPSUs and industries in the private sector. The scheme offers good self-employment opportunities to retired offi cers and adequate employment opportunity to ex-PBORs in a fi eld where they have suffi cient expertise.

The Department of Public Enterprises (DPE) has issued instructions to all CPSUs to get security personnel through ESM security agencies on the panel of DGR or from State Ex-servicemen Corporations (ESM Corporations), in states where they exist. Through this scheme, around 2000 ESM security agencies have been empanelled and over 1,90,000 ESM have gained employment. The RBI has also issued instructions that the security of the treasury chests of all Banks in the country be entrusted to DGR sponsored ESM Security Agencies, if the banks do not have their own security setup or state police security is not in place.

 (b) Offi cer’s Employment: During the year, a total number of 705 offi cers were registered with the DGR for employment assistance. 3239 offi cers have been sponsored for various employment opportunities. To spread

###### Appendix-III

 SUMMARY OF LATEST COMPTROLLER & AUDITOR GENERAL (C&AG) REPORT ON THE WORKING OF MINISTRY OF DEFENCE

 Report No. 4 of 2007: Union Government (Defence Services) Army and Ordnance Factories


###### II. MINISTRY OF DEFENCE

 Para 2.1 Delay in execution/ renewal of lease

 Abnormal delays ranging from 06 to 36 years in renewal of leases of Defence land occupied by Madras United Club at Chennai, Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) at Jabalpur, State Bank of India at Avadi, IOC and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd. at Belgaum resulted in non- recovery of substantial amount of rent and premium of several crore of rupees, and loss of interest thereon, which was yet to be assessed. Such delays on the part of the Ministry and the Director General Defence Estates in deciding the cases of extension of lease and revision of rental are inexplicable and require investigation.

 Para 2.2 Excess procurement of Hand Held Thermal Imager

 Ministry of Defence procured Hand Held Thermal Imager (HHTI) initially through a contract signed with a foreign


###### vendor during the year 1999 as pointed out in Para 4.1 of Report No. 7A of 2001 (Kargil Report) of CAG of India. Thereafter, the Ministry/ Army HQ procured HHTI through different sources including Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL).

 Based on the scales as approved by the Ministry, Army HQ assessed a total requirement of 4062 of HHTI inclusive of a reserve stock of 10 per cent which have been observed by Audit that Army HQ adopted an incorrect no. of Battalions while calculating the requirement and resulted in assessment and procurement of 56 HHTI in excess of authorization valuing Rs. 10.16 crore.

 III. ARMY

 Para 3.2 Extra expenditure in purchase of Post Fence Metal Angle

 Unjustifi ed delay in processing and fi nalisation of tender by the Director General Ordnance Services resulted in expiry of


-----

###### validity of bids necessitating subsequent retendering. Consequently 56867 pieces of Post Fence Metal Angles had to be purchased at a higher price resulting in avoidable excess expenditure of Rs. 52.34 lakh.

 Para 3.4 Non-crediting of revenue into Public Fund

 In violation of Ministry’s orders of January 2001 and diversion of revenue amounting to Rs. 1.28 crore realized by three Army units/ establishments from shops run on Government land/ buildings was irregularly deposited into their Regimental Fund instead of Government Account.

 Para 3.5 Recoveries/ Savings at the instance of Audit

 Based on audit observations, Army units and formations recovered or agreed to recover irregular/ overpayments amounting to Rs. 7.09 crore on account of double increments, fi eld allowances, transport allowance, encashment of leave etc. etc.

 IV. WORKS AND MILITARY ENGINEER SERVICES

 Para 4.1 Under-recovery of electricity charges

 Audit Scrutiny of bills in respect of recovery of electricity charges


###### from the paying consumers in Jaipur and Jodhpur area revealed that six out of nine GEs did not recover the element of fi xed charges from their paying consumers as levied by the Electricity Supplying Agencies in these areas. This led to under-recovery of Rs. 88.42 lakh for the period April 2001 to September 2005. On being pointed out by Audit, an amount of Rs. (4.58+0.27) 4.85 lakh have been recovered and balance is yet to be recovered.

 Para 4.3 Irregular sanction of special works

 In contravention of the prescribed procedure, Army HQrs sanctioned and constructed 76 garages for married offi cers at Pune and Chennai Stations in excess of authorization resulting in irregular expenditure of Rs. 67 lakh.

 V. RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT ORGANISATION

 Para 5.1 Sanction and execution of unauthorized works by DRDO

 DRDO is dedicated to the design and development leading to production of weapon systems and equipment in accordance with the needs projected by the three services and the grants


-----

###### voted by the Parliament for them are intended to be utilized economically and effectively for achieving these objectives. 

 Audit observed two cases of utilization of the funds for unauthorized works, one by ‘construction of a Convention Centre in New Delhi’ at a cost of Rs. 6.40 crore and second ‘repair and improvement to a Municipal road at Bangalore’ spending Rs. 64.13 lakh.

 VI. Border Roads Organisation

 Para 6.1 Faulty planning in construction of two bypass roads

 Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) issued by Director General Boarder Roads in October 1999 stipulated that the estimates submitted by the Chief Engineer of the Project for obtaining sanction for road works should invariably specify the availability or environment/ forest clearance details of land acquisition etc apart from other details of the project.

 In violation of above procedure, two Chief Engineers obtained sanction of DGBR for construction of roads to by pass Dimapur and Batala towns without ensuring complete acquisition of land and prior clearance of Forest and Railway authorities. As a result, partially


###### completed by pass roads constructed at a total cost of Rs. 11.75 crore (Rs 3.71 crore in respect of Dimapur and Rs. 8.04 crore in respect of Batala) remained non-operational since March 2005 due to land disputes and delay in construction of bridges.

 Para 6.2 Irregular payment of counter insurgency allowance

 In contravention of the orders of Ministry of Defence for payment of counter insurgency (CI) allowance with effect from  April 1, 1993, Army Offi cers and Personnel Below Offi cers Rank posted to Border Roads Organisation were paid CI allowance aggregating to Rs 2.99 crore though they were not actually engaged in the counter insurgency operations.

 VII. Ordnance Factory Organisation

 Para 7.2 Excess consumption of yarn

 Ordnance Clothing Factory Shahjahanpur consumed excess raw material to the extent of 35- 38 per cent of the authorization in the manufacture of socks during 2003-05, entailing a loss of Rs. 1.96 crore. No Board of Enquiry was constituted to investigate the reasons for the excess consumption.

 Para 7.5 Recoveries at the instance of Audit

 On pointing out the omission to avail of rebate or exemption


-----

###### from payment of energy tax, the Ordnance Factory Ambernath and Ammunition Factory Kirkee recovered Rs. 1.17 crore from the respective Electric supply agencies.

 PERFORMANCE AUDIT

 DEFENCE CAPITAL ACQUISITION (ARMY)

 A sound defence acquisition system ensures acquisition of capabilities sought for by the Armed Forces to meet the threat perception within a stipulated time and at an optimal cost.

 Performance audit of the capital acquisitions pertaining to the Army with main focus on procurement through import revealed the following:

 The capital acquisition planning in the Army suffered from delays and low fulfi llment. Approvals of both the Long and Medium term plans were abnormally delayed. Percentage fulfi llment of last three medium term plans varied from 5 to 60 per cent in respect of various Arms and Services of the Army.

 There was lack of effective coordination among the Services viz Army, Navy and Air Force in procurement of common items/ capabilities resulting in Army resorting to independent procurement of common systems instead of planning joint procurement to obtain best value for money, reduce tendering cost and minimize processing time.

 The acquisition process suffered from a major drawback of inaccurate formulation


###### of Qualitative requirements (QRs). In 50 per cent of the procurement cases test checked, specifi cations were changed after issue of tender/ request for proposal (RFP). Defi ciencies in QRs hampered selection of the optimum product and achievement of economy in procurement.

 The process of technical and trial evaluation did not demonstrate adequate objectivity and fair play. In 60 per cent of the cases, only a single vendor was qualifi ed after trial evaluation. Time taken for trial evaluation was unduly long and the time taken for preparation of the trial evaluation report was longer than the trials.

 Identifi cation of vendors in most of the capital acquisitions was inadequate. The number of vendors who responded to the RFP were too few thus restricting the competitive process in Army procurements. There was no system of vendor rating of the prospective suppliers.

 There were inordinate delays in procurement through Fast Track Procedure thus defeating the very purpose of adopting such procedure on the grounds of urgency.

 Internal lead time for normal procurements was also too high as 60 per cent of the cases took more than three years to sign the contract.

 The number of repeat order was considerably high. In 50 per cent of the cases examined, procurements were made by placing repeat orders on the vendors from whom the equipment were purchased earlier. Due to repeat orders, economies of scale or increased volume of procurement


-----

###### could not be exploited to negotiate better terms

 Multiple agencies with dispersed centres of accountability resulted in lack of coordination, diffused accountability and delay.

 Ministry has introduced revised Defence Procurement procedures in 2005 and 2006 incorporating some improvements in the procurement policy such as laying down time limits for fi nalisation of procurements, impact of which remains to be seen. (Chapter-I of Report No.4 of 2007 Army and Ordnance Factories (Performance Audit)

 Recruitment and Training of Personnel Below Offi cers Rank in the Army

 Personnel Below Offi cers Ranks (PBOR) constitute more than 90 per cent of the total strength of the Indian Army. For the Army to remain combat ready, it is vital to correctly assess the manpower requirement, recruit the right candidates in a timely manner and train them adequately for induction into appropriate Arms and Services. A performance audit of manpower management of PBOR with thrust on Other Ranks (ORs), i.e. excluding Junior Commissioned Offi cers and focus on manpower planning, recruitment and training revealed the· following:

 Due to incorrect assessment of manpower there was a mismatch between the authorization and actual manpower held. The defi ciency of the PBOR in Army consistently decreased from 6.88 per cent in 2001-02 to an excess of 2.41 per cent


###### over authorization in 2005-06 involving an additional liability of Rs. 524 crore in 2004- 06.

 Excess release of vacancies impacted the quality of training since the Regimental Training Centres (RTC) had to train recruits in excess of their designed capacities to the extent of 122 to 314 per cent.

 The manpower requirements of various Units and Establishments of Army were determined adopting vintage norms, which did not conform to the technological advancements and changed scenario.

 The system of review of Establishments by the Army Standing Establishment Committee (ASEC) for optimization of manpower was woefully inadequate as two-third of the establishments due for review, were not reviewed by ASEC during 2001-06.

 The incidence of relegation of recruits increased from nine per cent in 2001 -02 to 22 % in 2005-06.

 There was signifi cant defi ciency of critical infrastructure and essential training equipment such as fi ring ranges, parade grounds, gymnasium, simulators, tanks and other vehicles at RTC of six Arms and Services test checked in audit.

 Inadequate co-ordination among the various authorities resulted in signifi cant delays in commencement of Basic Military Training, Technical Trade Training and dispatch of recruits to Units after the completion of training.

 (Chapter-II of Report No.4 of 2007 Army and Ordnance Factories (Performance Audit)


-----

###### Management to Transport in the Army

 Transport is the lifeline of the troops during peace time as well as during operations. Class ‘B’ vehicles constituting personnel carrying/ load carrying and specialist vehicles provide mobility and logistic support to the Army. A performance audit, focusing on management of Class ‘B’ vehicles revealed the following:

 Modernization of transport fl eet in the Army was slow, as restructuring of the fl eet of ‘B’ vehicles initiated in 1971 had not been fully implemented till 2006. The delay resulted in Army carrying on with the vintage vehicles for nearly three decades that were not only fuel ineffi cient but also did not match the changed tactical requirements and weapons and equipment profi le.

 The system of review of establishments by Army Standing Establishment Committee to right-size their manpower, vehicles and equipment was inadequate as only 34 per cent of the establishments due for review were reviewed by ASEC during 2001-06.

 The information maintained by MISO about vehicle authorization and holding by various Units and Establishments was incomplete and unreliable.

 Procedural delays and involvement of multiple agencies delayed issue of authorized vehicles to Units up to 29 months.

 Army Headquarters was holding vehicles much in excess of their authorization to the extent of nearly 400 per cent by inducting, hiring, and attaching vehicles from lower units/ formations.

 About 32,000 unserviceable vehicles were lying in depots awaiting disposal, resulting in


###### unnecessary inventory carrying cost and loss of disposal value due to prolonged storage.

 Chapter-III of Report No.4 of 2007  Army and Ordnance Factories (Performance Audit)

 Summary of Important Audit Observations by C&AG of India

 Audit Report containing results of audit of Ministry of Defence in so far as they relate to Air Force, Navy and associated DRDOs for the year ended March 2006 (Report No.5 of 2007) was presented in both Houses of Parliament on May 14, 2007. The report included 21 paragraphs. Some of the important audit fi ndings included in the Report are indicated below:
 I.  Delay in replacement of obsolete radars in Air Force stations

 Based on requirement projected by IAF, the Ministry in March 2003 contracted for acquisition of radars with associated equipment and spares at an aggregated cost of Rs 585 crore with transfer of technology from the foreign vendor. Acquisition of these critical air surveillance radars to replace obsolete radars was considerably delayed. The acquisition process also deviated from the prescribed procedures. Further, ten radars costing Rs. 251 crore received by IAF between March 2005 and August 2006 remained uninstalled due to non-completion of works services. Consequently, IAF air bases continue to operate fl ights with obsolete radars. (Paragraph 2.1)


-----

###### II. Refurbishment and modernization of an aircraft

 Ministry concluded a contract in July 2001 with Original Equipment Manufacturer for Mid Life Upgradation of fi ve maritime reconnaissance aircraft of the Indian Navy at a cost of Rs. 673.42 crore to avoid replacement of the entire fl eet. Audit examination revealed that Mid Life Update Programme did not progress as per schedule owing to delays in fi nalisation of contracts for certain avionics, weapon systems and customer supplied equipment. Two aircraft refurbished at a cost of Rs. 269.37 crore were delivered after a delay of 25 and 16 months respectively. These aircraft are without essential avionics and weapon systems seriously limiting their operational capabilities. (Paragraph 2.2)

 III.  Training of Naval Pilots Abroad

 Indian Navy failed to synchronise training of pilots abroad with the acquisition schedule of the newly acquired fi ghter aircraft. Over projection of the requirement of the pilots to be trained, abroad resulted in avoidable liability in foreign exchange. The delays in fi nalisation of the deal also resulted in avoidable extra expenditure of Rs. 4.62 crore. (Paragraph 2.3)

 IV. Procurement of mine scanning equipment

 The Navy adopted non competitive process for inviting bids in the case of acquisition of mine scanning equipment costing Rs. 12.76 crore. This had resulted in acceptance of higher price with avoidable expenditure of


###### Rs. 3.07 crore. The delay in the installation of equipment resulted in loss of extended guarantee costing Rs. 9.81 lakh and also 20 per cent service life of the equipment. (Paragraph 2.4)

 V. Avoidable expenditure on repair and overhaul facilities of Main Fuel Control Units of an Aircraft

 IAF failed to get the repair and overhaul facilities for main fuel control unit of an aircraft set up in a BRD validated by the OEM within the validity period of the contract as the concerned BRD could not undertake a sample repair of MFCUs even with trained manpower. Repair facilities created at an investment of Rs. 5.57 crore thus remained unutilized even after seven years of being set up. As a result 37 MFCUs were offl oaded to the OEM for repair and overhaul at a cost of Rs. 18.38 crore and Ministry had to conclude another contract with the OEM for fresh validation and correlation of the facilities at a cost of Rs. 9.20 crore, which was avoidable. (Paragraph 2.5)

 VI. Extra expenditure on irregular grant of an Allowance

 Air HQ failed to adhere to the prescribed procedure for sanction of counter insurgency allowance and paid excess amount towards the allowance to all the IAF personnel posted in State ‘T’ (except one region) instead of identifying and paying the allowance to the personnel actually taking part in such operations as stipulated in the Government orders. (Paragraph 3.1)


-----

###### VII. Avoidable extra expenditure in procurement of spare aero -engines

 Flaws in technical evaluation of aero- engines coupled with failure in adhering to provisioning norms by Air HQ and poor planning in procurement of spare aero- engines for a fuel refueller aircraft resulted in avoidable extra expenditure of Rs.6.90 crore on subsequent procurement. (Paragraph 3.2)

 VIII. Injudicious procurement of prime movers

 Poor planning, lack of foresight in anticipating administrative problems and defi ciency in the procurement process adopted by IAF led to procurement of prime movers without successful fabrication of trailers resulting in unproductive expenditure of Rs. 48.65 lakh on procurement of ten prime movers and wasteful expenditure of Rs. 4.37 lakh on account of unsuccessful fabrication of trailer proto type. Six years after the procurement, the prime movers have neither been disposed of nor put to any alternative use resulting in blocking of funds. (Paragraph 3.3)

 IX. Unnecessary procurement of NATO suits

 Air HQ unauthorisedly imported NATO suits for eight years. Even after Ministry approved its introduction, Air HQ continued its procurement from the same foreign vendor without inviting competitive tenders although NATO suits was not a proprietary item. Failure to follow the basic provisioning norms also entailed an unnecessary


###### procurement of NATO suits worth Rs. 3.21 crore. (Paragraph 3.4)

 X. Operation of an auditorium on commercial basis by IAF on prime defence land without sharing earnings with the Government

 IAF permitted running of an auditorium as a commercial venture on prime defence land and no fi nancial benefi ts were being passed on to the Government as per MoD instructions even though manpower and other resources are being diverted from IAF to run the facilities. While the Government has incurred a loss of revenue to the extent of Rs. 8.02 crore on account of non recovery of rent, it incurred unauthorized expenditure of Rs. 1.37 crore for creating a supernumerary establishment for the auditorium and loss on account of consumption of electricity, which was yet to be quantifi ed. (Paragraph 3.5)

 XI.  Extra expenditure in conclusion of repair contract

 IAF sustained a loss of Rs. 1.52 crore owing to its failure to avail of higher rate of discount on account of conclusion of two separate contracts within a short time span of fi ve months instead of clubbing the requirement for concluding a single contract. (Paragraph 3.6)

 XII. Non-utilisation of XBT Probes

 Poor inventory management coupled with failure to assess effectiveness of the XBT


-----

###### Probe held as War Reserve by the Indian Navy led to non-utilisation of 1925 XBT probes within their shelf life entailing an infructuous expenditure of Rs. 47.16 lakh. (Paragraph 4.3)

 XIII. Delay in Development of a Sonar System

 A user driven staff project for indigenous development of Sonar system with a defi nite time-frame remained incomplete even after time overrun of over four years owing to improper planning, lack of co-ordination and poor monitoring of the execution of project. The delays led to upward revision of the project cost by Rs. 19.97 crore of which an expenditure of Rs. 9.94 crore was avoidable. Further, non-availability of contemporary technology to Indian Navy resulted in commissioning of four frontline warships without Sonar capability. (Paragraph 5.1)

 XIV. IT Audit of Air Force Central Accounts Offi ce, New Delhi

 IT audit of Air Force Central Accounts Offi ce, New Delhi disclosed overpayment of Air Worthiness allowance of Rs. 8.20 crore to Airmen due to inadequate check codes. (Paragraph 6.1)

 XV. Audit of Integrated Pay Accounting and Disbursement System (IP ADS) in Naval Pay Offi ce, Mumbai.

 Offi cers and sailors borne on the complement of a Naval ship are not entitled to Hardlying Money (HLM) when they are required to stay ashore during the period of refi t/ repair of the ship. Audit


###### examination of the data of Integrated Pay Accounting And Disbursement System of the Naval Pay Offi ce revealed that owing to failure of internal control, the offi cers and sailors borne on the complement of the ship continued to draw HLM even during the period a ship remained by shore for refi t/ repair in contravention of the rule resulting in overpayment to the extent of Rs 1.77 crore. (Paragraph 6.2)

 Operation and maintenance of an aircraft fl eet in the Indian Air Force

 Aircraft “A” are medium tactical transport aircraft primarily used for transport of troops and cargo; para trooping; supply dropping and casualty evacuation. IAF contracted purchase of 118 such aircraft and inducted the same into squadron service between 1984 and 1991. Facilities for maintenance of airframes were created at BRD “X” and for aero-engines at BRD “Y”. A performance audit of the aircraft fl eet’s operation and maintenance during the period 2001-06 was conducted. The audit focused on operational aspects such as achievement of fl ying tasks; assigned roles; serviceability targets and availability of operational manpower. Besides, with regard to aircraft maintenance the focus was on adequacy and effi cient utilization of repair and maintenance facilities existing in the IAF for the aircraft.

 The important audit fi ndings are:

� The serviceability levels achieved by
###### the aircraft fl eet were low and the percentage of Aircraft on Ground


-----

###### (AOG) was high indicating low effi ciency of operation of the fl eet. In comparison to the capacity of the aircraft, payloads carried were also low.

� Aircraft were predominantly used for
###### routine and miscellaneous tasks at the expense of primary air maintenance and training tasks.

� Eight aircraft were modifi ed for
###### “VIP Role” without approval of government thereby diverting them from operational tasks. Further, the modifi cation also lacked justifi cation as a separate specialized communication squadron with adequate aircraft for use by VIPs already existed.

� Para trooping is one of the primary
###### tasks of Aircraft ‘A’. In the Para trooping School and in a training center set up to impart training, most of the courses showed shortfall in achievement of targeted output. Envisaged conversion courses for which six aircraft were provided to the School, were not held at all during the past fi ve years.

� There were delays in conducting
###### overhauls and repair both by the engine and airframe overhaul facilities.

� BRD ‘Y’ failed to complete a large
###### number of allotted repair and overhaul tasks during the last 5 years due to shortage of spares which had resulted from delayed and inadequate provisioning. Consequently, 120 engines had to be sent abroad to the OEM for overhauls at a cost of Rs. 64.12 crore. Besides, several of the engines overhauled by this depot had to be prematurely withdrawn.


� Establishment of repair and overhaul
###### facilities for airframes at BRD ‘X’ was considerably delayed and some facilities are still to be established. Further, a project for creating facilities for overhaul of turbo-generators at HAL, Koraput, approved in 2001, is yet to be completed as of October 2006.

� There were delays in completing
###### second line servicing in a signifi cant percentage of cases due to shortage of spares.

� Though, indigenisation of mandatory
###### and non-complex spares at BRDs has made signifi cant progress, commercial exploitation has been limited.

� Inability to obtain technology for life
###### extensions of engines beyond 4000 hours would make IAF completely dependent for overhauls on the OEM in a few years.

 Provisioning and procurement activities at HQ Maintenance Command (HQMC) and Depots

 Provisioning and procurement together constitute the cornerstone of IAF’s materials management system. Earlier, all provisioning and procurement activities of stores were centrally undertaken by Air HQ but in September 1995, Government accorded sanction for transfer of provisioning/ procurement activities of stores to HQMC and Depots in a phased manner. Audit examined provisioning and procurement activities undertaken by HQMC, three Base Repair Depots (BRDs) and three Equipment Depots (EDs) during 2001-2006.


-----

###### Signifi cant audit fi ndings are:

� There was abnormal delay in
###### implementation of the plan for decentralization of procurement activities to Maintenance Command and Depots. Even after more than a decade, half of the provisioning and procurement activities continue to be centrally controlled by Air HQ.

� Provisioning reviews conducted by
###### HQMC for making procurements under delegated powers were delayed. HQMC failed to complete 70 per cent of the review work within the prescribed time schedule.

� Procurement from Government
###### agencies was low and HQMC procured items from trade at the rates higher than those offered by the government agencies entailing avoidable expenditure of Rs. 2.33 crore.

� There was lack of competitiveness
###### in the procurement process due to limited vendor base being maintained by HQMC and Depots.

� Indiscriminate changes in specifi cation
###### of clothing and general items of stores were made without reference and approval of the government. These changes resulted in reducing competition and avoidable extra expenditure and delay in procurement.

� Excessive local purchases of clothing
###### and MT stores were undertaken indicating HQMC not able to provide the required items in time to the dependent IAF units/ formations.


� Poor level of demand satisfaction and
###### large number of outstanding AOG demands and other demands for spares disclosed weakness in provisioning activities conducted by HQMC.

� Project for online management of
###### material inventory started in 1995 suffered from time and cost over-runs and is yet to become fully functional.

� Devolution of provisioning and
###### procurement responsibilities to HQMC was slow and halting and as such IAF was deprived of benefi ts envisaged from such devolution.

 Management of Equipment in Naval Dockyards, Mumbai and Visakhapatnam

� Naval Dockyards, located at Mumbai
###### and Vishakhapatnam, primarily undertake “refi ts” and repairs of naval ships and submarines. These Dockyards hold a large number and diverse range of equipment to conduct repairs and refi ts. Effective management of equipment thus has a critical bearing on the operations of these dockyards. A performance audit was conducted to study various aspects of the management of these equipment such as maintenance, operation and utilization, adequacy, replacement and augmentation of installed equipment in the dockyards. The period covered by this study is fi ve years starting from 2001-02. The principal fi ndings arising from the audit are given below:

� Funds provided for purchase of
###### equipment were not fully utilized by the dockyards.


-----

� Several old and obsolete equipments
###### were awaiting replacement due to shortcomings in the planning and contracting of equipment replacement.

� There were delays in creating repair
###### and maintenance facilities for newly acquired naval vessels.

� Maintenance of equipment in both the
###### dockyards was reactive to breakdowns and defects. Breakdown repairs took considerable time to complete even where these were off-loaded to trade.

� The dockyards undertook procurement
###### of spares only when repairs were on hand. These procurements, however, took considerable time to complete.

� Records of machine operation and
###### use were either not maintained or inadequately kept. Consequently, performance of equipment could not be monitored effectively by the dockyard managers.

 Bharat Earth Movers Limited

 Performance of Engine Division

 To meet the requirement of engines for the production of Earth Moving (EM) equipment, the Government accorded approval (1988) to establish manufacturing facilities of engines at the Mysore Complex of the Company. The fi rst phase of the project was commissioned in April 1991 and the second phase (with establishment of Flexible Manufacture System) in March 1998. The project envisaged manufacture of 2400


###### engines in the sixth year of commencement of production. A performance audit of the Engine Division was carried out and the major audit fi ndings were as below.

 The Company fi xed the annual production targets between 15 and 57 per cent of the installed capacity during 2000-01 to 2005-06. However, the Company could not achieve even these low targets as there were shortfall of 23 and 27 per cent in achieving these targets during 2003-04 and 2005-06 respectively.

 The Company resorted to manufacture of EM equipment with engines of other make despite availability of in-house capacity. As a result, the Company could utilize only 14 to 42 per cent of the installed capacity for captive consumption during 2000-01 to 2005 -06.

 The Company could not recover even the material cost in nine out of twenty models of engines produced during 2005- 06. The excess cost incurred by the Company worked out to Rs. 2.09 crore. The manufacturing cost was higher mainly due to high cost of raw material and components, under utilisation of installed capacity and low volume of production for captive consumption.

 The diversifi cation efforts (1998-99) made to manufacture and sell Company’s engines for use in Diesel Generator sets were not successful resulting in loss of Rs. 2.49 crore besides accumulation of unsold stock valuing at Rs.3.14 crore as on March 31, 2006. Another diversifi cation effort made (2004-05) to use the Company’s engines in compressor application was also not successful as there was no demand for the

###### compressors made by the Company in the market. (Chapter-III)

 Hindustan Aeronautics Limited

 Outsourcing activities

 The Company had been outsourcing components, tools and assemblies since 1980, However, a major thrust to outsourcing was given from 2002-03 by formulating (April 2002/ March 2003) the procedures and systems for outsourcing. The Company had outsourced works amounting to Rs.625.61 crore which worked out to 3.72 per cent of the turnover of Rs.16795 crore during 2002-03 to 2005-06. A performance audit was taken up to review the outsourcing activities in the Company during the period 2001-02 to 2005-06.

 The major audit fi ndings were as below.

� Determination of available in###### house capacity, which was vital for deciding quantum of outsourcing, was not realistic and uniform among divisions. In-house capacity was not properly utilized before resorting to outsourcing. The method adopted for working out savings from outsourcing was also not uniform.

� A systematic database of the items
###### to be outsourced had not been developed.

� The vendors list was not updated
###### regularly, mandatory documents during registration process were not obtained and orders were placed on unregistered vendors in certain cases.

� Developed vendors were not
###### nurtured by placing continuous orders.


###### Dependence on limited sources and non-development of alternative sources were also noticed.

� Placement of orders in excess of
###### capacity of the vendors was noticed. Repeat orders were being placed on selected vendors in spite of poor performance.

� It was noticed that orders were split,
###### repeat orders were placed without entering into any Long Term Agreement with vendors and adequate security was not taken for the raw material issued. There were also lacunae in the system of physical verifi cation and reconciliation of material lying with vendors. (Chapter-IV)
