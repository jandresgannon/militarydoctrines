MINISTER OF DEFENCE OF THE REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA

# Dear Readers,

We are publishing the new White Paper on Defence in a year when we are celebrating the 20th jubilee of the formation of the Army of the Republic of Macedonia and at the very beginning of the new cycle of defence transformation. The objective of this White Paper is to present comprehensively and transparently the security and defence policy of the Republic of Macedonia and to reaffirm its interests and values. The White Paper depicts the achievements in the defence sector and provides information on the contribution to global and regional security and stability. 

Furthermore, it presents the long-term defence development goals and the resource requirements, as well as the vision for further development of the defence. The Republic of Macedonia sees its future as integrated in NATO and the EU. The defence system of the Republic of Macedonia is fully prepared to assume the responsibilities and obligations that derive from the NATO 
membership, including the long-term contribution to regional and EuroAtlantic security and stability. 

We, in the defence sector, dedicated to our goal, are working on all levels, that is, on international, state and Army level. In international frames, in regard with the NATO membership, we are working on implementing all reforms and on the substantial contribution of the Republic of Macedonia to global peace through the military missions and the visibility of the country in all international institutions. In national frames, we are working on enhancing the inter-ethnic and inter-religious confidence. On the level of the Army of the Republic of Macedonia, we are working on creating a modern and professional army, improving the standard of the Army members and bringing the Army closer to the citizens. 

8 WHITE PAPER ON DEFENCE
The achievements in accomplishing the strategic defence missions thus far bind us to continue forward in the same direction. In the upcoming decade, the MOD and ARM will be transformed and will develop a broader spectrum of defence capacities and capabilities in accordance with the Long-Term Defence Development Plan. By 2015, the Army of the Republic of Macedonia will have a more efficient organizational - formation structure, will be more mobile and will comprise 50% deployable interoperable military capabilities. The manning level of the ARM will be steadily kept at 90% with qualified, well educated and well trained military personnel. The process of formation restructuring will be carried out gradually in a synchronized manner and the operational capability of the Army will be increased for the purpose of accomplishing the strategic defence missions, including the collective defence of the Republic of Macedonia and the contribution to the collective defence of the Alliance. 

The Army has to be modern, more mobile and fully interoperable with the Alliance member countries. The military equipment will be modernized gradually in the upcoming decade and beyond. Hence, the regional and multinational initiatives for developing common deployable capabilities in accordance with the NATO Smart Defence Concept will be utilized to the maximum extent. 

The Army of the Republic of Macedonia, being one of the institutions with the highest credibility with the citizens of the Republic of Macedonia, will serve as a model for cohabitation and mutual respect and confidence build*ing among the citizens of all ethnic and religious communities by taking up* the responsibility to provide inclusion in all leading structures of the Army. The accomplishment of this vision requires a political consensus in the country. The Ministry of Defence will ensure full transparency of the defence policy and of the implementation of the defence reforms, which called for adoption of the White Paper on defence. The reforms are a process that can only be achieved by ourselves by means of maximum utilization of the domestic expert capacities, the strong public support and the inter-agency coordination and cooperation. 

I believe in peace and stability as the foundation for sustainable development. Globalization and integrations are an imperative that leads to a better quality of life through stronger competition, transparency and functional democracy. In this respect, I see the Euro-Atlantic integrations as the best alternative for the future of the Republic of Macedonia and the Balkans. The future depends only on us - the citizens of the Republic of Macedonia, our preparedness to face the challenges and use all our potential to improve the living standard and the quality of life, that is, to make Macedonia a better place for living. 

Macedonia, a country of the equals, a country among the equals in NATO and the EU.

2. As a first White Paper published after 2005, it portrays the progress accomplished in defence during the past seven years in order to achieve higher security for the citizens of the Republic of Macedonia. The White Paper underlines the key processes and activities required for the determination of the future strategic guidance as prescribed in the strategic documents. Moreover, the White Paper contains details in regards to the important programmes, projects and activities contained in the 10 year Long-Term Defence Development Plan (LTDDP: 2011-2020).

3. The White Paper on Defence reaffirms the national values and vital interests, and provides a focus on achieving the defence priorities, especially those related to attaining membership in NATO and the EU, including its contribution to the Euro-Atlantic and regional security and stability. The Alliance recognizes Macedonia's dedication to the NATO values and out contribution to the Euro-Atlantic and regional security and stability. Furthermore, the 2012 White Paper on Defence will contribute to the better understanding of the future reform requirements and long-term investments in the defence by the state leadership and political structures as well as by the general public. The conclusion that the investments for development of the military capabilities of the Army in the upcoming decade are to be initiated now is inevitable.

- Reaffirming the readiness and dedication of the Republic of Macedonia to take on responsibilities and tasks that will arise from its future NATO and EU memberships. 

6.

SECURITY 
ENVIRONMENT 

![15_image_0.png](15_image_0.png)

# Security Environment

1. The current contemporary world is characterized with fast, complex and dynamic changes and faced with new growing asymmetrical threats and risks. Terrorism, transnational organized crime, fourth generation warfare, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, religious radicalism and extremism, illegal migration, unstable and non-functional countries and computer attacks are but a few. The world financial interdependency with its reflection on the crises of 2008 can be listed in the modern global challenges. The slow economic recovery and high financial deficit for some EU member states continue to be both an economic and a security challenge which, one way or another, result in the overflow of the financial instability to its surroundings. Thus, the need of security today is universal - no country can be completely isolated from the new security challenges. 

2. The 2010 NATO Strategic Concept describes the security environment as a wide and evolving set of possibilities and challenges to the security of the territory and population of the Alliance. According to the assessment by NATO, the globalization, the newly raised security challenges, sources of instability and potential conflicts will continue to contribute to the unpredictability of the security environment of the Euro-Atlantic area including the Region of Southeast Europe. The Republic of Macedonia shares the NATO assessment on the security environment and continuously provides significant contribution to the Euro-Atlantic security and stability. 

3. The Republic of Macedonia is located in the central part of SEE as the geographic crossroads between Europe, Asia and Africa which is of great significance for its development. From a security perspective, being on the crossroads of the main routs means greater possibility for terrorism, illegal migration, drug, human and weapons trafficking as regular transnational threats which impose the need of active cooperation with neighbouring countries and the international community. 

4. The strategic security environment of the Republic of Macedonia has significantly changed and improved in the past several years. The democratic changes in the SEE countries and the support from NATO and the EU have increased the impact on the Euro-Atlantic integrative processes. These positive changes create the modern political and security scene of the Western Balkans, where peace, cooperation, economic and democratic development between states has visibly improved and contributes to the advancement of the entire Region, including Macedonia. The Region, to which our country belongs to as well, is still burdened by unsolved issues and faces complex security risks. 

5. The Republic of Macedonia is aware of the influence by the global strategic changes and the irrationality and insufficient efficiency of an isolated security system. The defence system of the small countries with weak economies becomes even more sensitive to the global changes. That is why the Republic of Macedonia is even more dedicated to creating a system of joint values and participating in the cooperative forms and activities of the collective security systems with the end goal - accession to NATO 
and the EU. 

6. Even though the Republic of Macedonia is currently not facing direct conventional threats to its national security, it is not immune to the contemporary security threats. In that regard, the Republic of Macedonia will remain prepared to face threats on its national security and will continuously monitor the global trends and possibilities for development and advancement of the required defence-security capabilities and capacities. 

7. The NATO and EU membership is a strong motivational factor for the comprehensive national defence reform in the Republic of Macedonia. The Republic of Macedonia is fully prepared to undertake the obligations and responsibilities as a NATO member country and start the pre-accession negotiation for EU membership. From the perspective of the republic of Macedonia, NATO represents the key pillar of the contemporary Euro-Atlantic security architecture, while the EU is considered as the main driving force for democratic, economic and social development of the entire European continent. Once all countries from this region are integrated in the Euro-Atlantic family we can talk about Europe as a whole, free, democratic community of equal member states.

COMPREHENSIVE 
APPROACH TO 
NATIONAL SECURITY 

# Comprehensive Approach To National Security

## National Interests

1. The national security interests arise from the fundamental values set in the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia. Independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity and the unitary character of the country as well as its multi-ethnic and multi-cultural character are the lasting interests of the Republic Macedonia. 

2. The vital national interests are the following:
- Protection and promotion of peace, security, health and personal security of the citizens; 
- Promotion of the multiethnic democracy and multiethnic relations; - Preservation and improvement of democratic values of the state: human right and liberties, rule of law, political pluralism, open political dialogue between the political parties, principle of division of power, protection of the cultural identity and heritage of all Macedonian citizens; 
- Stimulation of sustainable economic and social development of the country based on the principles of market economy, private property and entrepreneurship;

3. The necessary preconditions for execution of the vital the interests are the following: 
- Contribution to the peace and stability in the world, in Europe and in the Region of Southeast Europe; 
- Development and maintenance of all possible forms of cooperation with neighbouring countries, expedient to the vital interests;
- Building a just social state from the aspect of creating equal opportunities for all citizens regardless of their gender, race, religion, political or ethnic background;
- Improvement of the internal stability of the country, as a precondition for sustainable political, economic and social development; 
- Development of a modern democratic society; - Protection and improvement of the environment. 

4. The Republic of Macedonia will accomplish its interest by consistent observance of the human rights and liberties, the democratic principles and the international law, which in turn enables peaceful solution of disputes, promotion of peace and stability and improvement of the image that the Republic of Macedonia has in the democratic world. The Republic of Macedonia provides long-term contribution in handling crises in the Euro-Atlantic area as part of the international initiatives and missions. 

## National Security And Defence Policy

5. The National Security System of the Republic of Macedonia reflects the security policy implemented through the foreign, interior, defence, economic, social and environmental policies. The subjects of the national security system are constantly upgrading and enhancing the institutional capacities so as to respond to the national security threats. 

6. Protection and promotion of the lasting interest and the vital interests of the Republic of Macedonia are fundamental goals of the national defence and security. 

In order to enforce, defence is organized as an integral part of the system for comprehensive security possibilities and capacities. Integration in NATO and EU and the active participation in other forms of international cooperation are considered to be a possibility for effecting national interests by the Republic of Macedonia. Macedonia has declared its dedication to joining NATO since 1993 and the dedication to join the EU in 2004.

7. The Republic of Macedonia has well a developed strategic framework in regards to the security and defence, and a well established system for long-term planning, programming, budgeting and execution. The instituted political and normative frame of the strategic defence documents demonstrate the outlook and direction of the national security and defence policy, the development of the defence system, the challenges that require a response and the risks and threats that the defence system will deal with in the future period by accomplishing its strategic missions. 

8. In support of the national security, the defence system of the Republic of Macedonia is capable of providing support and executing of the following strategic missions:
- Defence and protection of the territorial integrity and independence of the Republic of Macedonia;
- Participation in the NATO collective defence; - Contribution to operations in the broad spectrum of UN, NATO and EU led missions;
- Protection of the wider interests of the Republic of Macedonia.

9. The national security goals of the Republic of Macedonia articulate the effective organization of the national security system and represent the basis for practical inter-departmental coordination and joint actions. The development and maintenance of the national defence system as an instrument of the national security policy represents a continuous obligation of all state institutions. For that reason the state institutions continuously enhance the capacities and capabilities for:
- Development and implementation of efficient assets and methods for information and data collection of vital importance to the security, high quality expert analysis of the security environment and efficient inter-departmental cooperation;
- Interoperability and compatibility of the national defence capabilities in accordance with the NATO and EU standards;
- Leading comprehensive foreign policy for attainment of the national interests and goals in compliance with the international - legal standards, building and enhancing the multilateral and bilateral relations with the international entities;
- Dealing with transnational organized crime in all its forms, terrorism and corruption;
- Participation in UN, NATO and EU led international peace keeping operations;
- Leading an active, good neighbourly policy and participating in the improvement of regional cooperation.

## Institutional National Security And Defence Responsibilities

− decides on the methods for accomplishment of the defence preparations.

15. The use of ARM in the crisis management system is regulated in the Crisis Management Law. Part of the Army provides support to the police when the crisis situation threatens the security of the Republic when the state administration bodies do not have the appropriate resources for its prevention and management. Upon a proposal by the Government, the President decides on the participation of part of the Army in crisis management situations. The manner of participation of part of the Army in crisis management is regulated by the President, while the operational and other procedures of the Army in support to the police are regulated by a Guidance adopted by the Minister of Defence and the Minister of Interior.

# The Army Of The Republic Of Macedonia

## Missions And Organization

1. The primary mission of the Army is the defence and protection of the territorial integrity and independence of the Republic as well as the protection of the population against external threats in all conditions - peacetime, crises and war. Moreover, the Army is prepared to meet international obligations - contribution to NATO collective defence, participation in international operations and protection of the broader national interests. 

2. The current and planned ARM priorities, missions and tasks are the following:
- Surveillance and air defence of the national air space and NATINADS ; - Participation in international (multilateral, regional and bilateral) air policing arrangements for our national air space;
- Support to the police and other state institutions in the protection of the critical national infrastructure and support in dealing with the consequences in case of a terrorist attack;
- Support of the state institutions in case of natural disasters and epidemics, technical - technological and other hazardous situations and crises; - Rapid deployment of credible forces in multinational NATO-led joint operations abroad or in THE NATO collective self-defence operations; 
- Effective command and control in accordance with the requirements of the NATO Network Enabled Communications and Information Capabilities Concept; 
- Effective military intelligence and reconnaissance in support of the ARM 
expeditionary operations; 
- Logistic sustainability of the deployed national contingents, including the capabilities for involvement in multinational logistics;
- Role 2 medical support of the deployed contingents; - Force survival and protection in conditions of close combat and NBC 
threats;
- Defence of the forces against improvised explosive devices; - Execution of operations in complex geographic and climate conditions, including extremely hot and cold weather conditions;
- Urban operations; - Training of all units, particularly the deployable capabilities, according to the NATO Joint C2 Doctrine and Procedures and the Joint and Combined Land Operations;
- Development of CIMIC capabilities;
- Contribution to the broad spectrum of peace support operations led by the UN, NATO, EU or friendly coalitions;
- Contribution to NATO military structures; - Multilateral and bilateral defence cooperation. 

3. The Army's role in support of the Police and other government institutions is regulated with the Defence Law and the Crisis Management Law, as well as with the establishment of practical standard operational procedures.

The Army provides continuous support during natural and humanitarian disasters and catastrophes management. Each year, the Army engages 1000 Army members, hundreds of motor vehicles, and several helicopter in fire fighting operations in the country. Also, the ARM was engaged in removing the debris caused by the adverse weather conditions in the municipalities of Radovish, Strumica, Tetovo, Prilep and other. Each winter, the helicopters of the Army participate in the distribution of food and other essentials to the local population in the areas difficult to access due to heavy snow storms and in saving and evacuating sick people in need of medical assistance. 

4. The ARM has demonstrated high operational commitment to international operations. Around 3000 male and female military personnel have participated in international operations, 11 of which gave their lives for the mission. The military personnel of the Army displayed a high level of training and qualification; however the sustainability of our contingents in international operations represents quite a challenge. 

5. The Army is designed as a unique set of effectively structured, multipurpose, interoperable and deployable forces whose purpose is to fulfil the national and international obligations. The Army consists of branches, services and support services organized in units, commands, staffs and institutions. According to their capabilities and task, they are grouped in combat forces, combat support forces and combat service support forces. 

6. The ARM has an approved military personnel size of 8133, and the manning will continually be maintained at around 90%. By the end of 2020, the ratio Officers-NCOs-Professional Soldiers should be 1:2:4.

The JOC commands the following units: - 1. Mechanized Infantry Brigade;
- Air Force Brigade; - Logistics Brigade; - Military Police Battalion; - Signal Battalion; - Active Reserve Forces. 

10. The First Mechanized Infantry Brigade is the main combat force of the ARM which provides forces prepared to execute the Army mission. It participates in peace operations and fulfils the international obligations abroad. 

11. The Air Force Brigade provides air support and transport of the ARM 
units, surveys the national air space and provides air defence for the combat units elements and more significant facilities on lower altitudes. Moreover, it participates in peace support operations abroad. The brigade units conduct search and rescue, fire fighting and medical evacuation of civilians during natural disasters and catastrophes. 

12. The Logistic 

![37_image_0.png](37_image_0.png)

Support Brigade does planning, organizing, coordinating transport, supply and maintenance and medical support to the commands and units of the ARM.

13. The Training ad Doctrine Command (TRADOC) is responsible for the individual combat training of the active and reserve military personnel. TRADOC is also responsible for developing combat training doctrines as well as organizing foreign language courses and professional development. The following centres fall under the TRADOC: 
- Individual Training Centre; - Training Support Centre; - Centre for Doctrines and Lessons Learned,
- Cadet Training Centre; - Foreign Language Training Centre; - K-9 Centre. 

14. The TA Krivolak, also under TRADOC Command, is intended for execution of different types of tactical exercises, live shooting with various calibres and 

![38_image_0.png](38_image_0.png)

shooting air targets. The size of the area and built infrastructure allows training up to the brigade level. The area is used for execution of pre-deployment training of the declared units for participation in international operations. The Training Area Krivolak offers the training areas for: execution of operations in urban environment, operations in alpine conditions, and operations in authentic conditions - African village, sniper shooting house and launching hand grenades. The modernization of the training area is underway with the construction of a Non-lethal Weapons Centre supported by Kingdom of Denmark, USA and other countries. 

15. The Special Operations Regiment (SOR) executes special operations, conventional and non-conventional operations, independently or in co-action with other ARM units in peacetime, crisis or war. In support of peace and conflict prevention the SOR includes: 
- Command Company; - Special Forces Battalion; - Ranger Battalion; - Logistic Support Company.

16. The purpose of the Electronic Reconnaissance Centre is to collect intelligence data by electronic reconnaissance of the electromagnetic spectrum to enable early warning and protection of the armed forces as well as important national security and defence data collection.

17. The ARM commands and units are located in the barracks and facilities in the garrisons: Skopje, Petrovec, Chojlija, Tetovo, Shtip, Kumanovo, Kichevo, Veles Prilep and Krivolak. 

18. The strategic commitment of the Republic of Macedonia for longterm contribution to regional and Euro-Atlantic security and stability, as well as the full readiness to take on all the obligations and responsibilities that come with NATO membership obliges us to develop and maintain deployable interoperable capabilities at 50% of the total ARM land force structure. Upon NATO request we will deploy a maximum strength of one Medium Infantry Battalion Group and National Support Element. The Medium Infantry Battalion Group is generated from the Mechanized Infantry Brigade and will be fully manned, trained and equipped with the available military equipment. 

19. The Republic of Macedonia will develop and sustain the following Army units and capabilities for NATO led operations: 
- One Medium Infantry Battalion, to be transformed into a Medium Infantry Battalion Group, by the beginning of 2015;
- Two transport helicopters; - One Military Police Company;
- One Long-range Reconnaissance Company;
- One Role 2 Medical Treatment Facility, as of 2014; - One Engineering Platoon; - One Engineering Demining Team; - Two Special Operations Teams.

## Transformation

20. In the period 2005 - 2012, a radical transformation of ARM based on 

![40_image_0.png](40_image_0.png)

the thorough plans and conclusions from the 2004 Strategic Defence Review was carried out. The Army has transformed itself into a fully professional force, with a smaller number of personnel and structure, and with significantly improved interoperable forces to be deployed abroad for participation in NATO, EU and UN led international operations. More specifically, today, around 30% of the Army land forces are ready to deploy in international operations, which allows for good preparation, timely contingent rotations and effective overall contribution in five international operations. 

JOC - Joint Operational Command LSC - Logistic Support Command TC - Training Command SOR - Special Operations Regiment TRADOC - Training and Doctrine Command 21. The new cycle of the Army transformation that began in 2012 was thoroughly planned in 2010-2011, in close cooperation with NATO and our Strategic Partner - the USA. In 2010, the President adopted the RM Defence Strategy, a document that provides strategic guidance for transformation of the Army into an effective, efficient armed force ready to face 21st century challenges. The Government then approved the LTDDP 2011-2020, which provides a unity of institutional efforts for systematic development of defence and alignment of the limited resources with key development priorities. In 2011, the President and Commanderin-Chief of the Armed Forces passed a Decision for Transformation of the Army Units and Commands. 

22. Essential benefits from the new ARM structure are as follows: 
- Simplified force structure;
- Appropriate grouping of the combat, combat service and combat service support forces under one command;
- Improved integration of the air capabilities, for air defence and air surveillance within one unit - air brigade;
- Achieving better manning of the units with personnel and equipment; - Introducing a new category of active reserve.

## Building Military Capacities And Capabilities

23. The fulfilment of the strategic defence missions requires upgrade of the existing and development of new ARM operational military capabilities for execution of a broad spectrum of military operations, from large scale combat operations (Alliance Collective Defence) to peace support and humanitarian operations 
(assistance during disasters). The ARM must be modern, mobile and fully interoperable with the NATO forces. Hence, new large transformation efforts are required for developing interoperable deployable military forces, with flexible structure, properly manned with quality military personnel, well equipped and well trained. 

24. In the coming decade, the efforts and resources will be focused on improving the existing military capabilities and developing new currently nonexistent military capabilities required for conducting the assignments resulting from the strategic defence missions. In the development of new ARM military capacities and capabilities, the priority will be placed on the following areas: 
- Air surveillance and air defence of the national air space and connection to the NATINDAS; 
- Participation in intentional air policing arrangements for the Republic of Macedonia;
- Development and sustainment of 50% deployable capabilities of the Army land forces for contribution to NATO-led multinational joint operations or in NATO collective defence operations; 
- Upgrading and promoting the education and training capacities.

25. By 2015, we plan to establish a proper Air Surveillance and Reporting System and connect this system to the relevant NATO capacities through the ASDE Programme. This will provide an air situation picture and support the air operations over our territory. By establishing the Air Surveillance Operations Centre 
(ASOC) and the Air Operations Centre, we will meet all the key preconditions for creating an integrated C2 system and utilizing the air space control and protection capacities.

26. The Memorandum of Understanding signed by Republic of Macedonia and SHAPE in 2011 regulates the connection of national air surveillance and reporting capacities with NATINADS. Modern 3D radar systems are to be procured as part of the BRAAD Initiative (Balkan Regional Approach to Air Defence) between Macedonia, Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro. The full implementation of the BRAAD Initiative represents a creative and rational approach to the development of the joint regional air defence capabilities in the spirit of the NATO Smart Defence Concept.

27. Regarding the air defence capacities and capabilities, the plan is to equip the Air Force Brigade with 3 to 4 low altitude air defence missile batteries and three to four short range radars by 2020.

28. In order to reinforce the infantry operational capabilities, by 2015 we plan to provide packages for training, operational application and logistic support for at least one medium infantry battalion in accordance with the NATO Code of Capacities and Capabilities. As part of this project, we also plan to acquire medium and long range anti armour systems. One additional medium infantry battalion will be modernized by 2020, followed by gradual modernization of the remaining infantry battalions beyond 2020. 

29. The military personnel and equipment (howitzer 105mm and selfpropelled system BM-21 GRAD) from the current four artillery battalions will be concentrated into one partially deployable artillery battalion. The modernization with Howitzer 155mm is planned for the period 2016 - 2020 and beyond.

30. The lessons learned from participation in international operations indicate that it is of an imperative importance to possess proper tactical level capacities for handling IEDs. The personnel and equipment in the existing permanent compositions for detecting and destroying IEDs and the expertise and personnel from pioneering compositions will represent the basis for developing the organic capabilities for handling IEDs as part of the engineering units.

31. The international operations support capabilities are essential for the future development of the Logistic Brigade. Ever since 1999, the ARM has continually provided logistic support to KFOR. In 2007, we took over the entire responsibility for the KFOR Coordination Support Centre located in Petrovec.

32. The Military Medical Centre will establish and sustain one Medical 

![43_image_0.png](43_image_0.png)

Treatment Facility Role 2 (MTF Role 2) with support from the Kingdom of Norway (medical equipment package) and the USA (logistic equipment package). MTF Role 2 can be deployed in international operations, independently or in segments, as part of the regional and multinational medical task forces.

RESOURCES

# Defence Resources

## Human Resources 47

1. The successful implementation of the strategic defence missions depends essentially on the operational capabilities of the Army, i.e. educated and trained, capable and motivated professional military and civilian personnel. Practice shows that all aspects of the Human resource management, attraction, selection, education, training, motivation, rewarding, promotion and service termination contribute to the successful development and maintaining of the operational forces and capabilities.

2. In 2006, the conscription service was replaced by the voluntary army service, thus making the ARM fully professional. With the MOD and ARM transformation, in the period between 2005 and 2007, the number of officers and NCOs significantly decreased. In addition, part of the of military and civilian personnel from the Army have been transferred to the Ministry of Interior, the Protection and Rescue Directorate, the Crisis Management Centre, the Directorate for Security of Classified Information, the Court Police and other bodies of state administration.

REVIEW 
number of employees in the ARM in categories for the period from 31.12.2005 to 31.07.2012

![47_image_0.png](47_image_0.png)

3. In 2012, the ARM is manned with 6952 military and civilian personnel or 85.5% manning. The Ministry of Defence employs 976 personnel out of whom 197 are military personnel in the Army. 

By 2016, an active reserve of 1800 personnel will be established. The active reserve model requires contracting the persons that will apply for the advertisement announced by the MOD. The members of the active reserve will be paid a certain amount per month and will be obliged to participate in the training and exercises in the country and abroad in the course of the year. 

4. One of the greatest challenges in the future will be to continue attracting the high quality personnel. To that end, in 2005, the MOD adopted the Programme for attraction of qualified, competent and highly educated professional military and civilian personnel. The MOD and ARM will conduct campaigns on the military profession in the high schools and universities and media campaigns in the electronic and written media.

5. The personnel selection process is based on the laws and by-laws adopted by the MOD. The proper selection in all categories ensures the selection of highly qualified personnel that will provide the future potential managers and leaders in the MOD and ARM. The time and efforts spent on selecting the right people for the right positions facilitate the personnel managing process, thus preventing any potential problems in the subsequent phases. 

6. The retention of qualified personnel in the MOD and ARM is based on the financial benefits from the employment, the standards and conditions of work, and the perspectives to build a career through education, training and professional training. The compliance with the laws and by-laws and the implementation of the Concepts for Officers and NCOs in the ARM, provide continuity in the development and retention of the qualified personnel in the defence. 

7. The Army Service Law enables the military and civilian personnel to attain the right to retirement with at least 25 years of service in the Army regardless of their age, insofar as they do not meet the age limit retirement conditions. 

8. With the amendments of the Army Service Law in 2010, the legal regulation of the resettlement process has been completed with full application of the NATO standards. The resettlement process in the MOD is conducted through the Lepeza Programme. In the period between 2006 and 2012, around 410 members of the Army used the benefits of this programme. The programme is implemented with the support of the Government, the Employment Agency, the entire business community and the Kingdom of Norway. 

9. The healthcare of the military and civilian personnel in the ARM and MOD 
is regulated with the Army Service Law and the Law on Health Care. In 2010, the Military Hospital was transformed into the City General Hospital 8 Septemvri and the ARM Military Medical Centre. The Centre is intended to provide health care to the employees in the MOD and ARM and the personnel from the garrisons and units during field activities. 

10. The equal opportunities policy is based on the generally recognized civilization principles and the basic principles of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia which stipulate that: "all citizens of the Republic of Macedonia are equal in their freedoms and rights, regardless of sex, race, skin colour, national and social origin, political and religious beliefs, property and social status". This policy is the basis for the Equal Opportunities Programme in the ARM and MOD adopted in 2005. 

The improved working conditions and the observance of the trends in the modern armies have resulted in the increasing interest of women to serve in the Army.

## Gender Representation In The Army Equitable And Appropriate Ethnic Representation

11. According to the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia, one of the fundamental values of the constitutional order of the country is the appropriate and equitable ethnic representation of the citizens that belong to all ethnic communities in the Government bodies and other public institutions. The Defence Strategy of the Republic of Macedonia pays special attention to the preservation and promotion of the strong and functional multiethnic democracy and constant promotion of the interethnic relations as a separate vital interest, which can be achieved by fulfilling the objectives from the Programme for appropriate and equitable ethnic representation in the ARM and MOD of 2012.

12. In the period 2005-2012, the appropriate and equitable ethnic representation of military personnel (officers, NCOs and professional soldiers) has significantly improved. The analyses indicate that the set goals have not been achieved yet and that greater efforts should be invested in the production of officers from the non-majority ethnic communities.

## Representation Of The Ethnic Communities In The Military Personnel Of The Army

13. This situation imposed a need for adopting a new programme on appropriate and equitable ethnic representation in the ARM and MOD. The program foresees the implementation of a number of measures in different spheres, from attracting, educating, training, retaining of qualified personnel to promoting leaders and holders of senior military functions in the country and abroad. The implementation of the programme will ensure the balancing of the outflow and inflow of military personnel from the ethnic communities which will contribute to building mutual trust and respect among the employees, while respecting the standards for highly qualified personnel. 

The goals for the civil servants will be achieved on the basis of the Law on Civil Servants and the Strategy for appropriate and equitable ethnic representation in the Government of the Republic of Macedonia.

## Education And Training

14. The education and training cover the overall education throughout the career course of the employees, starting with the entry level in all personnel categories. This education is provided by the Military Academy, the national training centres and through participation in international courses and exercises. The aim is to provide continuity in the education and training of the personnel, especially of the declared forces. 

15. The Military Academy General Mihajlo Apostolski - Skopje as an associate member of the University Goce Delchev - Shtip, represents a higher education and scientific research institution for educating personnel for the needs of the Army (students - cadets) and for the Crisis Management System and the Directorate for Protection and Rescue. The Military Academy is an accredited higher educational institution in compliance with the Bologna Convention and the European Credit Transfer System according to which the following university studies are conducted:
- first cycle (BA) accredited programme; - second cycle (MSc and MA) accredited programme; and - third cycle (PhD) accreditation ongoing.

16. In compliance with the reaffirmed goals for continuous professional education of the officers in the ARM, the Military Academy introduced an advanced education of officers. The education covers: 
- Course for officers for the logistic specialties and services in the ARM; - Course for company commanders of services and logistic specialties; - Course for battalion level staff duties.

![51_image_0.png](51_image_0.png)

17. The Military Academy provides continuous education for the cadets and students and at the same time offers a wider spectrum of curricula subjects in defence as a wider scientific area in social studies, especially the part referring to military and military - technical sciences, the crisis management system and protection and rescue. The basic goal of educating the cadets and the students in our Military Academy is a comprehensive development of the personality of the future military officers and civil servants that will be psychologically, physically, morally ready and specialized in executing the tasks and dealing with the new challenges. 

18. In order to promote itself, the Military Academy is also engaged in intensive international cooperation, and especially undertakes measures and activities for its establishment as a regional educational institution. The Military Academy educates cadets for the needs of the Montenegrin Armed Forces. As of 2012, cadets from the Republic of Kosovo will be educated at the Military Academy. Thus, the diploma received upon graduation from the Military Academy is recognized and accepted outside our national borders. 

19. The Ministry and the Army, in cooperation with other higher educational institutions, educates personnel for its own needs in all three cycles of education. Moreover, a certain number of officers and civil servants acquire a higher level of education in the military academies, colleges and other higher education institutions abroad. 

20. The Military Academy has been organizing the international project Summer Campus attended by cadets, students and officers from different universities and 

![52_image_0.png](52_image_0.png)

academies from the country and abroad. The aim is to bring closer to the participants the complexity of the challenges that they might face in their line of work. The level and quality of the Summer Campus have been increasing each year. The renowned professors, academic workers and experts in the area of security and defence from the country and abroad, as well as from several influential operational and academic institutions from the entire world make the effects achieved by this project even more prominent.

21. The training in the ARM and especially of the declared units for NATO-led operations is based on the accepted NATO standard procedures. The quality of the ARM training and the operational capability of the declared units is evaluated through the Operational Capabilities Concept, NATO evaluation and reporting, and the АCО Forces Standards - Combat Readiness Evaluation - CREVAL. The key personnel in the ARM 
and MOD and the declared units have a priority in language training. 

22. The lessons learned from the international operations and exercises, as well as the NATO recommendations highlighted the need of developing deployable interoperable forces and capabilities. The experience and the lessons learned in the international operations and exercises are constantly being applied in the training and they are to be used in the preparation of doctrines for training of the active military and reserve personnel. 

23. The training is conducted in the TRADOC, the Military Medical Centre, the Regional Communications Training Centre, the Joseph Kruzel Centre and the Pilot Training Centre. 

24. The Military Medical Centre is responsible for maintaining and promoting the development of the Medical Training Centre, which has already been included in the regional network of training centres. The centre was established with the assistance of the Swiss Confederation, nevertheless it needs additional investments in order to be transformed into a Regional Medical Training Centre. The Centre conducts training for the following profiles:
- first aid instructors; - lifesaver self aid or buddy aid training (first aid) training; and - pre-deployment medical training. 

25. The Regional Training Communications Centre (RTCC) conducts public relations trainings. The conducted training to date is organized on 3 levels (basic, intermediate and advanced level) of trainings in communication skills and media training, communication in crises, as well as military briefings. The initiative for transforming the RTCC into a PfP/NATO Centre of Excellence was launched in 2011. Our priority is to extend the content and the number of instructors, both nationally and regionally, and thus contribute to the promotion of the regional character of the Centre. The future vision is to include national level participants from other ministries, the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia, the local self-government and other institutions in the existing target training groups, having in mind that this is the only centre that can provide such services to the state administration. 

## Defence Funding

26. The MOD/ARM perform their essential missions, tasks and functions using all available resources, thus underlining the vital importance of the Government of the Republic of Macedonia to develop representative and well-defined national fiscal strategies that: 
- enable proper prioritization of resources among national security-related missions, tasks and functions; 
- provide for appropriately balanced use of resources across the Ministries and organizations to support the national security/defence goals and objectives; 
- encourage a dialogue among/between Parliament and the Ministries regarding national security; and 
- develop a disciplined sense of purpose and transparency for planning and implementing practical security/defence budgets. 

27. During the past seven years, the defence planning systems and processes have been used with increased efficiency to accomplish support for security resourcing without sacrificing effectiveness. Additionally, better business practices and enabling technology tools have been used to increase the overall security capabilities and capacities. While going through an ambitious reform process, the security institutions, including the MOD/ARM, have been able to accomplish the current missions, tasks and functions and plan and prepare for the future at the same time. Without the focused strategies, determination, vision and involved leadership, the current security and defence reform efforts would not have been possible in an era of limited resources caused by the global economic crisis.

28. The planned structural changes, based on the Strategic Defence Review, were successfully implemented by the transfer of border security to the MOI 
and the Military Hospital to the Public Healthcare System, and the establishment of the Crisis Management Centre, the Directorate for Protection and Rescue and the Directorate for Security of Classified Information. The process of transferring certain functions from the Ministry of Defence to other state bodies, followed by the regrouping of the ARM units, was successfully completed by the process of divesting the excess military facilities to other state bodies and the local self-government. 

The implementation of the structural changes led to redefining the MOD/
ARM missions accompanied by a reduction of the employees by 20%, thus creating objective conditions for restructuring the defence budget, i.e. allocation of the budget in accordance with the 50:30:20 formula (personnel, operations and maintenance, equipment and modernization). 

29. Despite redefining the ARM and MOD missions, the budget was sustained at 2% of the GDP, which enabled the full professionalization of the Army and manning with qualified personnel, improved the maintenance of the equipment, promoted the education and training, initiated the process of equipping and modernization and brought about a permanent increase in the contribution to international operations (Table 1).

30. Nevertheless, the global financial crisis and its negative influence on the economy in the past three years have triggered a cut in the defence budget. Despite the efforts of the ARM and MOD to achieve financial efficiency, the defence budget cut has gradually impaired the ARM modernization and equipping efforts. Even with the defence budget cut visible achievements can be noted in the continuous manning of the ARM with qualified personnel, restarting the Military Academy, intensifying the education and training, conducting operations in support of other state institutions and significantly increasing our contribution to international operations. 

31. Prioritizing the programmes, projects and activities is critical at a time of limited defence resources. The main priority is reflected in the lasting commitments for NATO membership, including the long-term contribution to the regional and Euro-Atlantic security and stability. Thus, the costs for international operations since 2005 account for about 50 million Euros, i.e. 8-10% of the annual defence budget. Our participation in operations has contributed to the improved interoperability with our allies and partners; has provided practical training of our soldiers; has improved the reputation of the Republic of Macedonia as a stakeholder in the global security and stability and has enhanced the strategic alliance with our partners. 

32. The transformation of the ARM and the preparation of 50% deployable forces, as well as the reduced dynamics in the implementation of the equipping plans over the past years shall be completed by the gradual growth of the defence budget, development of new modalities in the regional cooperation, implementation of the NATO Smart Defence Concept, as well as through the direct support from the friendly countries via donations in the defence sector. 

33. Working more economically, and applying the PPBE system enables allocation of the limited defence resources among the critical project, activities and programmes. Modernization in the forthcoming years can be positively influenced by constant budget growth, development of new models of regional cooperation, utilization of the NATO Smart Defence Concept, and direct support from the friently countries. If the current economic crisis continues to deepen, the MOD/ARM 
shall seek new modalities and concepts for development of military capacities and capabilities. Based on the Smart Defence Strategy, the Ministry of Defence will rationalize the defence expenditures and enhance the activities and its involvement in regional and international projects in accordance with our defence goals. Regional cooperation and the application of the NATO Smart Defence Concept provide the possibility for the Republic of Macedonia to jointly invest with other countries from the Region and NATO. The lacking capacities and capabilities shall continue to be developed on a regional basis. 

34. In circumstances of an economic crisis, it is difficult to predict the dynamics of the defence budget increase. However, the Government remains committed to the future defence development and will invest additional efforts to accelerate the return of the defence budget projections as given in the 2011-2020 Long-Term Defence Development Plan (Table 2).

Based on the Smart Defence Strategy, the Ministry of Defence will rationalize the defence expenditures and intensify the activities and its involvement in regional and international projects in accordance with our defence goals.

# Contribution To International Operations And International Cooperation

## Contribution To International Operations

1. Led by the principle of indivisibility of the security in the Euro-Atlantic region, the Republic of Macedonia contributes in the efforts of the international community for protection of world peace and security. The contribution of the Republic of Macedonia towards global security, peace and stability is first and foremost reflected in the investment of its own security capabilities and capacities in accomplishing the common values and interests. 

2. In accordance with the ratified international agreements, the Army units from the active and reserve component or parts of them, as well as officers and civilians in the Army and the employees of the MOD, can participate in exercises and training in humanitarian and peace-keeping operations abroad. 

3. The first contribution of the Republic of Macedonia abroad started in 2002 within the framework of the NATO led mission ISAF in Afghanistan. Macedonia later increased its contribution by taking part in the mission Iraqi Freedom, the EU military operation in Bosnia and Herzegovina ALTHEA and the UN mission UNIFIL in Lebanon. Additionally, the Republic of Macedonia has been providing constant support to the NATO led mission KFOR in Kosovo since 1999.

## Arm Contribution To International Operations

4. The Republic of Macedonia as a responsible member of the international community remains resolutely involved in the joint efforts for establishing security and achieving long-term partnership with Afghanistan on the basis of the principles for transferring ownership of security to the Afghan government and the NATO 
principle "in together, out together". The contribution to date and the mission of the national contingent will gradually change from force protection to training and assisting the Afghan security forces. 

5. Our contribution with forces to **ISAF** began in 2002. It was gradually 

![61_image_0.png](61_image_0.png)

increased and in 2010 it reached the highest level of approximately 250 soldiers per rotation. In the framework of our contribution to the ISAF heretofore, ARM medical military personnel has been part of the Combined Medical Team of the Adriatic Charter nations (Macedonia, Albania, and Croatia) and from August 2005 to July 2009 successfully functioned in 8 rotations at Kabul airport. Currently, the Republic of Macedonia deploys one company securing the ISAF Command in Kabul (150), staff officers in the OMLT, the Joint medical surgical team in the Norwegian provincial reconstruction team (PRT) in Maymana and police instructors (A5 team) in the Military Police School of the Afghan National Army in Kabul. In addition, in the course of 2010, the ARM contributed to the contingent of the 86th brigade of Vermont National Guard (USA) in ISAF with a military police platoon for training of the Afghan National Police and a ranger platoon for training of the Afghan National Army. 

6. In the period 2003 - 2008, the Republic of Macedonia participated in the mission **Iraqi Freedom**, led by USA, with a total of 11 rotations and 490 military personnel. The initial contribution was a single special task platoon which was reinforced with an additional platoon in 2008. 

7. In 2006, the first contribution of the Republic of Macedonia in the EU 
led mission **ALTHEA** commenced with the participation of a helicopter detachment of two helicopters Mi-8/17 and it ended in July 2008. The contribution to ALTHEA continued with the deployment of the Role 1 Medical Team, the Legal Advisor and Preventive Medicine NCO in the EUFOR HQ. 

8. The Republic of Macedonia participates in the EU Battle Group Concept and is part of the **EU BG II/2012** with Germany as the lead nation - together with Austria, the Czech Republic, Ireland and Croatia. The national contingent comprises 150 military personnel: one infantry company, staff personnel in the force command, mixed NBC section, intelligence team, medical technician in the medical company Role 1 and a National Support Element. The contingent is fully prepared to be deployed during the second half of 2012. 

9. As of May 2007, we started our contribution in the UN-led operation UNIFIL in Lebanon with one staff officer. Currently the sixth rotation is underway.

10. The contribution of the Republic of Macedonia to international operations represents a concrete confirmation of the successes achieved in the defence reform and the firm strategic commitments of the country for NATO and EU membership. Two hundred members of the Army have been decorated with various medals of bravery, dedication and high professional achievements. 

11. The Mid-Term Defence Development Plan 2012-2017 sets forth the projections for future participation in international operations as follows:
- Continued participation in the NATO-led ISAF mission by 2014 and contribution and support to the Afghan Security Forces beyond 2014;
- Participation in EU-led operations; - Participation in UN-led missions; - Continuous support to KFOR.

## International Defence Cooperation

12. The Ministry of Defence remains to be active in the defence multilateral, regional and bilateral cooperation. As a nation aspirant for NATO and EU membership has intensive and close cooperation with both organizations and their member nations. In 2008, the establishment of the strategic partnership with the USA 
brought about conditions for even stronger support of the Republic of Macedonia in its preparations for NATO membership, especially in regard with the education of officers, training, ARM equipping and joint participation in international operations. 

Bilateral Defence Cooperation Plans have been signed with 24 countries and various activities are being executed. In addition to the cooperation with the NATO and EU member countries, the defence cooperation has been enhanced with the People's Republic of China. 

13. The Ministry of Defence has adopted a new Defence Diplomacy Strategy the basic objective of which is to deepen and strengthen the defence cooperation and enhance the defence diplomacy network. The current multilateral defence diplomacy network includes: 
- 1 Defence Attaché in the OSCE Mission in Austria, who covers Austria, Croatia and Slovenia as a non-resident attaché;
- 5 persons in the Mission of the Republic of Macedonia to NATO in Brussels; - 2 persons in the Liaison Office at the Allied Command Operations in Belgium; - 1 person in Liaison Office of the Allied Command Transformation in the USA; - 4 persons in the South-Eastern Europe Brigade (SEEBRIG) HQ in Greece; - 1 person in the RACVIAC Centre for Security Cooperation in Croatia.

14. On bilateral level 6 resident attaches have been posted in the USA, 
the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Turkey and Greece. Moreover, there is a civilian defence attaché in the USA. Also, we have assigned one non-resident attaché that covers Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo. In 2012, the Ministry of Defence will post defence attaché in China, and in future, possibilities and resources are being reviewed for opening new posts in the UN Mission in New York, the EU Mission in Brussels and in Russia.

15. In addition to the personnel executing national duties, the Ministry has appointed personnel to international duties in the NATO Commands and HQs as Partner Staff Elements in Brunssum, Mons, and Brussels, where they will acquire the necessary work experience in multinational headquarters on international duties.

16. The multilateral international cooperation is practically supported through joining numerous conventions and participation in many regional initiatives and projects. The UN is a universal, international organization and forum where our peaceful foreign policy is continuously shared and reaffirmed. Therefore, in the defence and security arena, Macedonia acts in accordance with the UN principles. The Republic of Macedonia, as part of the cooperation with international security organizations - UN, NATO, EU and OSCE, has an active participation approach in the creation and execution of global defence policies and in the improvement of the national capabilities for managing new threats, risks and challenges so as to ensure a more efficient management of civilian and military capacities in the interest of global peace and stability. 

17. The Republic of Macedonia, as a member of the OSCE, is a signatory of the arms control agreements, the Vienna Document 1994, Vienna Document 1999 and Vienna Document 2011. In order to execute the assumed obligations, the MOD 
has established an Arms Control Centre and launched close bilateral and regional cooperation with most of the countries that have signed the agreements. In the future period, we will become a part of the adjusted agreement of the CFE - Conventional Forces of Europe and the training of personnel for implementation of the aforementioned agreements in accordance with the agreement. We are especially active in supporting the arms control measures, preventing the proliferation of weapons for mass destruction and providing capacities for their use. In that respect, the Republic of Macedonia favours the enhancement of its national contribution as a way to promote peace and promote the measures for building trust and security in the world. 

## Regional Defence Cooperation

18. The Republic of Macedonia remains dedicated to the future promoting of the regional cooperation, enhancing the security and stability, exchanging experience and supporting the nations of the region, as well as their integration in the Euro-Atlantic structures. Regional defence cooperation includes regular political consultations on all levels, joint trainings, construction of regional training centres, and establishment of military units as well as joint participation in international operations. 

19. The close and fruitful regional cooperation of the US-Adriatic Charter 
(A5 format) is a sterling example of the successful format for inclusion of all countries in the region, including the Republic of Kosovo. The Republic of Macedonia believes that the promotion of the A5 cooperation is double benefit approach, for the peace and stability as well as for the Euro-Atlantic integration of the Region. 

![64_image_0.png](64_image_0.png)

20. The national defence reforms, especially in conditions of economic crises are a new and great challenge for all countries of the Region. History lessons teach us that periods of economic crises bring the possibilities of new ideas and concepts that can facilitate more rational behaviours and better results. Macedonia is convinced that the innovative NATO Smart Defence Concept can become a strategic guide in management of the contemporary risks not only for Macedonia but for the entire region.

21. The Balkan Regional Approach to Air Defence (BRAAD) initiative is the first project for building joint regional capabilities. The Republic of Macedonia considers that the joint approach can be implemented in other projects in the area of modernization of the national armed forces, after intensive dialogues and consultations with the countries from the Region. 

22. Similarities and joint national operational requirements, as well as requirements for well trained and certified Forward Air Controllers and Regional Medical Task Force represent a significant possibility for joint achievement of capabilities and capacities. 

23. The Republic of Macedonia continues to actively participate in the SEDM process as a wider format for defence cooperation in Southeast Europe, dedicated to the promotion of peace, stability and security of the region. The most visible project of this initiative is SEEBRIG, currently under the command of an ARM general. 

24. The Republic of Macedonia supports the development and the new projects of SEDM; such as the Building Integrity Initiative, with the goal to decrease risks of corruption in the security sector and the Female Leadership in Security and Defence Conference with the goal to assess the place of female leaders in the organization for security and defence in the region of Southeast Europe.

25. As part of the South Eastern Europe Clearinghouse - SEEC initiative, in 2012, the Republic of Macedonia stands as co-host of this initiative. During its chairmanship it intends to promote the Regional Training Communications Centre, the Military Medical Centre and the Krivolak Training Area as possible facilities offered to the use of countries from the region and NATO members. The aforementioned facilities are opened and are being used by the countries from the Region.

# Defence And Society

## Army And Society

1. The civil-military cooperation is an integral part of the contemporary multidimensional operations and activities engaging all involved subjects. The Army of the 

![68_image_0.png](68_image_0.png)

Republic of Macedonia demonstrates its readiness for comprehensive cooperation by implementing concrete activities and projects of broader social interests. Within its possibilities and capacities, the Army is continuously involved in giving logistic support for dealing with certain infrastructural problems, providing material, equipment and services for various sports, cultural and humanitarian events and activities. 

The Army has regularly taken part in the traditional campaign of the Government of the Republic of Macedonia "The Day of the Tree" in which hundreds of members of the Army take part with appropriate logistic support. In addition, the ARM provides logistic support in addressing certain local infrastructural problems, such as road expansion, repairs, reconstruction and consolidation for the needs of the local self-government in the Republic of Macedonia in length of hundreds of kilometres. 

2. The functioning and accomplishment of missions and tasks in multinational and multi-confessional conditions is specific and accompanied by a number of challenges and it entails the need for introducing new training forms and methods for the personnel responsible for civil-military cooperation.

3. The end result of the successfully implemented measures in the scope of civil-military cooperation is building civil - military conditions that will be in function of improving the morale, the material basis, the ecologic environment and creating a tactical advantage in the execution of the task. The personnel responsible for civil military cooperation are to:
- Establish cooperation with the civilian authorities on all levels; - Take direct part in the planning process;
- Make assessments of the immediate and broader civilian environment, including an assessment of the needs of the civilian population;
- Conduct certain civilian activities by using military forces and assets;
- Advise the responsible commander on all aspects of civil-military cooperation.

4. Considering the fact that in the execution of the missions, the unit commanders communicate with many civilian organizations and agencies with clearly defined missions, methods of work, roles and responsibilities, the well trained personnel is a key precondition for achieving success in complex and crisis situations. 

5. The cooperation with non-governmental organizations is accomplished in the area of education of the young population by organizing seminars, debates and other manifestations in which the ARM members take an active part. The Ministry of Defence of the Republic of Macedonia cooperates with the Institute for Security, Defence and Peace at the Faculty of Philosophy, the Faculty of Security - Skopje and all other higher education institutions. 

## Public Relations

6. The capacities of the Ministry of Defence for strategic communications provide correct and timely information about its internal components, the state bodies and the public for the purpose of enabling proper assessment and understanding of the facts related to national security and defence. Providing a continuous inflow of information to the media is especially important for the purpose of avoiding disinformation, rumours, speculations and the impatience of the public and particularly of the families of the ARM members engaged in military operations, as well as for the purpose of increasing public caution and the understanding of the activities conducted in the framework of international operations. 

7. Public relations in the defence sector are undergoing a process of transformation, both in terms of their organization and planning and the manner of work with the information contents and activities. The good part is that this area has a certain foundation to be built upon and experiences for further upgrading and adjustment to the modern possibilities and requirements. 

8. The mission of the Ministry and the Army to inform the public is to provide complete, timely and accurate publishing of the information related to the activities of the Ministry of Defence and the ARM commands and units in the country and abroad in line with the principles and regulations for operational security and for privacy of the forces and personnel. 

9. The principles of the Ministry of Defence for informing the public are intended for a wide spectrum of peace situations, crises and a state of war.

А) Transparency; B) Responsibility and competency for presenting the information; C) Access to information, in compliance with the Constitution and the laws; D) Timely and correct publishing of the information for the public; E) Equal access of all media to the information; F) Internal informing; G) Personnel security.

10. Starting from the general commitment, public relations should be defined through attaining the following specific principles:
- Providing maximum defence related information to all interested parties, in accordance with the national security and defence policy;
- Achieving and maintaining a level of knowledge and support of the defence policy by the internal structures of the Ministry of Defence and the Army and by the public and the community;
- Achieving and maintaining best possible relations with all structures and segments of the community in terms of mutual cooperation, organizing and implementing joint activities in the process of accomplishing the set tasks in the defence system;
- Developing and strengthening the awareness of the citizens of the Republic of Macedonia of the need for accomplishing the constitutional rights and obligations with regard to the defence preparations and the defence process;
- Raising the dignity, image, morale and readiness of the subjects and holders of the defence activities in all defence structures and inciting the motivation for full and quality execution of the functional tasks. 

11. The basic goal of all efforts of the Ministry of Defence and the ARM 
for informing the public is to ensure public understanding and support for the activities implemented by the competent department and the ARM units and commands in accordance with the missions and tasks. 

12. The specific objectives of the public informing are as follows:

![70_image_0.png](70_image_0.png)

А. Increasing the public knowledge and promoting the understanding of the public of the tasks accomplished by the Ministry of Defence and the ARM, its role, possibilities and its significant contribution to the stability in the region and beyond; B. Ensuring to the best possible extent accurate, full and prompt informing of the public regarding the activities of the MOD and the ARM commands and units in the country and in the framework of the international peace missions for stabilization and peace support outside the country. 

13. These objectives will be achieved for the purpose of:
(1) Increasing the public support for the activities conducted by the MOD and the ARM in the country;
(2) Increasing the public support for the cooperation of the ARM units with NATO, especially in areas where ARM units are deployed in peace support missions;
(3) Overcoming all potential misunderstandings in the public and all potential disinformation regarding the mission, roles, possibilities and activities of the ARM units and commands;
(4) Contributing to the effectiveness of the MOD and the ARM commands, units and personnel in responding to the requests of the media.

14. The Minister of Defence plans, organizes and conducts the overall relations with the public related to the Ministry of Defence and the Army of the Republic of Macedonia via the Spokesperson of the Ministry of Defence. 

In addition, the Spokesperson coordinates the development of information programmes and the production of printed and audio-visual programmes and electronic networks (Internet). The Spokesperson of the Ministry of Defence runs the overall public relations service and bodies in the defence sector and incites their activity by creating conditions for maximum efficiency. 

15. A new Department for Communications, Analytics and Operational Support has been established in the Ministry of Defence run by a Head who is also the 

![71_image_0.png](71_image_0.png)

Spokesperson of the Ministry of Defence. The Department encompasses five sections: 
- Section for Media and Multimedia Affairs, - Section for Publishing and Production, - Section for Planning, Strategic Analyses and Research, - Regional Communications Training Centre, - Protocol Section.

16. In 2012, the Ministry of Defence adopted the Strategic Communications Strategy. In addition to the conventional means of communication, by redesigning the official internet page and regular informing of the public though press releases, the MOD is extensively using the social networks. They are undisputedly the simplest way and an excellent opportunity for prompt and accurate publishing of the daily events and activities accompanied with the necessary multimedia elements - photographs, videos, etc. Moreover, this type of communication enables and incites discussions, which represents the best way of achieving the communication with the public we are targeting. In addition to the "Facebook"- page, the Ministry of Defence has recently opened an official "YouTube"- channel that is constantly updated by presenting important activities in and outside of the Republic of Macedonia, as well as the dynamic of the exercises in which the Army takes part. This news clearly indicates that the Ministry of Defence keeps track with the world trends in this area. 

17. With regard to publishing, the magazine "Shtit" and the journal "Sovremena Odbrana" ("Contemporary Defence") will be published in Albanian and English, 

![72_image_0.png](72_image_0.png)

in addition to Macedonian. In addition, the journal "Sovremena makedonska odbrana" is also published to present and promote the scientific views and achievements in the defence and security of the Republic of Macedonia in the region and beyond. This journal will be raised to the level of international journal whose International Editing Board will include experts from the entire region, including the Adriatic Charter nations. 

18. A confirmation for the positive impact of the public relations system on society is the highest level of trust in the Army of the Republic of Macedonia by all its citizens, in comparison with the other institutions, regardless of their ethnic background. The Ministry of Defence intends to implement specific projects and other forms of cooperation for bringing the ARM closer to all ethnic communities in the Republic of Macedonia. In this way, we will attempt to raise the level of confidence in the members of the ethnic communities. We expect that the Army of the Republic of Macedonia will retain its highest rating with its work and successes and the Ministry of Defence will continue to be a respectable Ministry in close contact with the citizens. 

19. The internal information targets the internal defence structures, that is, the MOD employees and the members of the ARM. The previously defined positions for public informing are equally relevant for the internal informing, with the specific primary objective of motivating the subjects in the defence system for full and efficient execution of the functional tasks. The contents of the internal information are comprehensive and directed towards certain occurrences, events and activities and are made on a daily basis. 

20. The Ministry of Defence has a adopted a plan of activities on the basis of the need for undertaking activities for internal informing of the employees in regard to the measures and activities for restructuring the ARM and the reforms in the MOD. Thematic meetings are held with members of the Union and other employees in the defence sector of the Republic of Macedonia to address issues related to the personnel policy, the statute and the living and working conditions. Thus, the MOD and ARM management leads direct talks with the majority of the professional personnel of the Army and the MOD. In addition, independent institutions make anonymous polls for the employees to determine the employees' mood and views. The results of the poll are then analyzed and appropriate conclusions are made.

# Defence Development Vision

1. The Army is an organization composed of well prepared and capable men and women, fully dedicated to the defence and security of the Republic of Macedonia and the defence of its national interests. In support of the national security goals and tasks our Army successfully conducts missions with a broad spectrum of military operations, ready to respond to different national and international contingencies. In order to be able to ensure the well-being and security of its population, the army must prepare for the unpredictable future. The Republic of Macedonia sees its future as a fully fledged NATO and EU member. 

2. The vision provides guidance on the transformation and building of the Army in the forthcoming decade, supported by the efficient and effective MOD - Army which will be ready to preserve the national interest and contribute to global peace. If we want our Army to be modern, effective, flexible and easily adjustable, the Republic of Macedonia will have to invest into and develop capabilities and capacities essential to its Army. 

3. The overall vision on the required ARM and MOD capacities and capabilities is based on our periodical assessment of the strategic context in which our forces operate. When the state leaderships determine changes in the strategic environment, the MOD will update the Defence Strategy and the Long-Term Defence Development Plan in order to achieve its short and long-term goals. In the forthcoming decade the efforts and resources will be focused on upgrading the existing capacities and concurrently building new military capabilities. The vision will be focused on the following major areas:
- Transformation of the Army and the Ministry of Defence 
- Increased operational capability of the Army - Improved equipment and infrastructure maintenance - Long-term contribution to international operations - Integration to NATO and the EU - Intensive regional and international cooperation - Improvement and integration of the C3 Systems - Improved mobility, transport and deployment capabilities - Achieving interoperability with the NATO member countries - Enhancing the Programmes for leadership and professional development of the ARM and MOD
- Preparing relevant doctrine on the engagement of the ARM in conditions of change in the strategic and operational environment
- Recruiting qualified personnel and achieving appropriate and equitable ethnic and gender representation
- Retention of highly educated and trained personnel
- Development of focused logistics (delivering the right equipment, reserves and personnel in the right quantities to the right place, in the right time in order to support the operational goals)
- Developing defence acquisition based on the strategy "From Concept to Capability"
- Application of the Smart Defence Concept - Strengthening force protection - Developing effective plans for strategic communication - Promotion of the internal working processes - Promotion of the Planning, Programming, Budgeting and Execution System 
(PPBES)
4. The major projects integrated in the Defence Vision are given in short. 

These projects are required for the gradual improvement of the capabilities and capacities without bringing the effectiveness of the ARM and MOD and their missions and tasks in question.

## Restructuring The Army Of The Republic Of Macedonia

5. The Army continues to implement its dynamic transformation process by 2015. This process will ensure greater operational capabilities, better focused C2 System and augmentation with prepared, trained and active reserve personnel with strength of 1800. The ARM restructuring will provide operationally prepared forces manned up to a minimum of 90% with equipment and trained personnel according to NATO standards. 

6. The planned MOD transformation is to ensure greater efficiency in the execution of the missions, tasks and functions. To that end, a Study on the functions and organization of the ARM GS and MOD will be prepared by the end of 2012. The new MOD organizational structure will be introduced In accordance with the conclusions arising from the above-mentioned study.

## Projects For Modernization Of The Army

7. The military equipment of the Army needs to be gradually modernized in the forthcoming decade and beyond. To that end, the regional and multinational initiatives for development of joint deployable capabilities in the spirit of the NATO Smart Defence Concept will be used to the maximum extent. According to the 2011-2020 Long-Term Defence Development Plan it is our obligation to achieve the following major ARM modernization and equipping projects:
- Development of integrated facilities and capabilities for air surveillance and reporting;
- Acquisition of three-dimensional radar(s);
- Helicopter Pilot Training Centre; - Logistic Information System; - Training equipment and infrastructure; - Helicopter modernization; - Individual and collective NBC equipment;
- Communications equipment; - Non-combat motor vehicles; - Wheeled APCs for two medium infantry battalions in accordance with the NATO Code on Capacities and Capabilities;
- Tactical communication system for one medium infantry battalion; - Advanced individual combat systems, and - Low Altitude AD Systems (up to 3000 m).

8. The national air policing poses a great challenge for the Republic of Macedonia to be solved in close cooperation with NATO. In that spirit, together with 

![78_image_0.png](78_image_0.png)

NATO, we are looking into all possible options (bilateral and multilateral) for securing the aviation capacities and providing air policing capabilities. Our first step in that regard is to improve the air force infrastructure for reception and staging of air policing capacities and capabilities.

## Improving The Processes

9. In order to improve the internal operating procedures, new information tools and techniques are being in introduced, along with the subsidiary more efficient business processes and practices. They will ensure the vertical and horizontal communication, coordination and information and documentation flow within the ARM and the MOD and between them. These tools and processes include:
- Personnel Management Information System (PMIS); - Logistic Information System (LIS); - Global Communications Information System (GCIS); - Document Management System (DMS); - Planning. Programming, Budgeting and Execution (PPBE) System; - Computer based training; - Preparation of strategies and plans.

10. The MOD will adopt a Strategy on divesting the excess equipment and non-essential infrastructure which will be handed over to other state institutions and local self-government. This Strategy shall introduce improved business practices, increase the efficiency of the process and achieve transparency. The divesting is planed to be automated as part of the LIS. 

11. The NATO Smart Defence Concept is a better way of developing capacities by pooling resources. The Smart Defence Strategy will enable the Republic of Macedonia to provide methods for improving security while reducing the costs. The Republic of Macedonia is engaged in a number of current and future planned capacity pooling and sharing activities, prioritizing and coordinating the efforts with its partners and allies. The following projects have been initiated to date: 
- joint Adriatic Charter (A-5) team to the Military Police School (MPS) in Kabul; - Balkan Regional Approach to Air Defence (BRAAD); - Regional Training Centre Krivolak; - Regional Non-lethal Training Centre; - Regional Medical Task Force.

## Managing Human Resources

12. The ARM and MOD will continue to attract qualified personnel and retain the most qualified personnel in its organizations. The ARM and MOD operational capabilities and capacities will continue to be supported by well-educated, professional, capable and motivated military and civilian personnel. 

13. In the forthcoming period, the human resource management will focus on:
- updating and implementing the Human Resource Strategy; - implementing the programmes for equal opportunities and equitable and appropriate ethnic representation;

![80_image_0.png](80_image_0.png)

![80_image_1.png](80_image_1.png)

- preparing a Programme for the professional development of leaders/managers; 
- continuing the implementation of the LEPEZA Resettlement Programme; - adopting a Concept for psychological support of military and civilian personnel during deployment in peacekeeping missions and operations; 
- supporting the families of the deployed personnel to international missions and operations.

## Education And Training

14. In the future, the Military Academy General Mihaijo Apostolski will promote the educational progress and professional career development of the offers by:
- introducing new contemporary educational methods and technologies, including the application of simulations and the use of IT;
- intensifying the scientific research; - accrediting at least one III cycle study programme studies; - introducing and promoting the pilot training curricula;
- intensifying international cooperation in the military education field; - initiating cooperation with other higher education institutions in the country.

15. Candidates for the highest military and civilian duties in the Army and the Ministry of Defence should be sent to the appropriate strategic education at the staff and national defence colleges and universities in the NATO member countries. The education should enable better understanding and awareness of the processes for strategic planning, defence institutions, civilian control over the military and Alliance related issues.

16. Continuous investment in promoting individual and collective training commands and units, training the declared units and the active reserve. Parallel to the ARM transformation process, the training should be adapted to the requirements of the modern military equipment and lessons learned from participation in international operations. Moreover, the opportunities for training in the international and regional exercises, as well as the bilateral exercises should be used to the greatest extent possible.

17. The Training Command will modernize the equipment and infrastructure in all garrisons and existing training centres and establish a Centre for the development of doctrines, rules, guidelines and lessons learned.

18. The Pilot Training Centre was opened in 2011 as a public private partnership between the MOD and Elbit Systems from Israel. The advertisement for admission of candidates for pilots was announced in 2012. Their education in the Military Academy will start in the course of this year. In addition to training pilots for the needs of the ARM, training will be provided for other state institutions. The training shall be conducted in compliance with the modern programmes and methods by using simulators. 

In addition to training pilots for the needs of the ARM, training will be conducted for the needs of other state institutions as well. After achieving Full Operational Capability, the Centre will grow into a Regional Pilot Training Centre for the training of pilots from other countries.

19. In the process of learning foreign languages priority should be given to the key ARM and MOD personnel and the personnel to be deployed in international missions and operations. By 2014, the active use of the English language will be included as a necessary condition for promotion to the rank of major and above.

20. The defence infrastructure will be improved by modernizing and reconstructing the existing and building new capacities. 21. The accomplishment of this defence development visions requires political consensus in the country. The Ministry of Defence will ensure full transparency of the defence policy, including the implementation of the defence reforms. Only we, ourselves can implement the reforms, as a process, by maximally utilizing the national expert capacities, strong public support and interagency coordination and cooperation.
