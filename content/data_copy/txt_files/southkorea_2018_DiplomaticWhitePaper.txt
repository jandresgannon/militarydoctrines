Diplomacy reflecting the will of the people, and Diplomacy comprising communication with the people The year 2017 marked a great turning point in the history of the Republic of Korea. At the domestic level there was a clear demonstration of a strong will for change and intercommunication on the part of the people. And, with the changes in the global landscape, at the international level a great number of challenges were faced. On the Korean Peninsula, with the advancement of the nuclear and missile capabilities of North Korea, tensions were heightened.

Against such a backdrop, over the last year, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has strived to engage in a diplomacy that meets the demands of a new era, in keeping with the national vision of the Moon Jae-in administration of seeking to achieve a "Nation of the People, a Just Republic of Korea."
The Ministry has exerted efforts to fulfill the expectations of the people, making the people and the national interest a top priority. At the same time, it has endeavored to confidently conduct diplomacy in a manner befitting the status of the country in the international community. As a result, we have been able to create historic momentum, opening a new era of a peaceful and prosperous Korean Peninsula, and, in that process, have secured the cooperation and support of countries around the world. It is our sincere hope that this precious achievement can go beyond the Korean Peninsula and serve as a starting point for achieving peace and common prosperity in the East Asian region.

In keeping with the keynote of diversifying diplomacy, the New Northern Policy and New Southern Policy have been implemented to expand the diplomatic horizons. In tandem with this, as a responsible member of the international community, we have stepped up our role and contribution on various global issues. Such attempts have served to bolster the solid base of support for our foreign policy from the international community, becoming a driving force for the fostering of a favorable diplomatic environment.

Furthermore, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has exerted heartfelt efforts to realize "Diplomacy reflecting the will of the people, and Diplomacy comprising communication with the people." The Ministry has gained the support and appreciation of the Korean people for our foreign policy through diplomacy for the people and public diplomacy. The Ministry also has exerted untiring endeavors for the protection of Korean people living abroad.

The 2018 White Paper sets out these foreign policies and activities conducted in the diplomatic field. It is our heartfelt hope that this White Paper will serve not only to offer an overview of achievements in our foreign policy, but as a valuable basis for even more active and thriving diplomatic endeavors in the future. In addition, we trust that this White Paper will enable you, the people of the ROK, to gain a deeper understanding of our diplomacy, offering a firm foundation for communication with the people.

Your warm encouragement and continued interest in the ROK's diplomatic efforts in the future also would indeed be most deeply appreciated.

December 2018 Minister of Foreign Affairs   Kang Kyung-wha

## World Trends In 2017

Chapter 1 International Political Chapter 2 Korea's Foreign Policy 8

## � Global Overview 2 Regional Overview

The global economy grew 3.6% from the previous year, on the back of increased trade and shared growth of advanced and emerging economies. In particular, the US
led the economic boom with a GDP growth rate of 2.3% and an unemployment rate of 4.1%, while Europe also recorded the highest economic growth rate of 2.5% in the past ten years due to strong domestic consumption and exports. China, which had recorded 6-7% economic growth rate amid the global economic downturn, grew 6.9% in 2017, maintaining its status as the world's leading economic power along with the US.

Meanwhile, inter-Korean relations were strained by North Korea's sixth nuclear test in September followed by its launch of an Inter-Continental Ballistic Missile (ICBM)
in November. As a result, tensions surrounding the Korean Peninsula were further heightened. In response to North Korea's provocations, the UN Security Council unanimously adopted resolutions on strong sanctions in June, August, September, and December. The Korean government continued its efforts for North Korea's denuclearization in line with such moves by the international community.

President Donald Trump of the United States launched the America First policy in 2017, which brought about a shift in global order. The year also saw the US-led liberal rules-based order facing a significant challenge, both within and without.

The US increasingly turned to protectionism in international trade and immigration, while China's rise and the increasing influence of Russia in East Asia and the Middle East were also prominent developments.

The Trump administration, which was launched in January under the flag of the America First policy, announced six key tasks to make the US great again, such as the creation of jobs and boosting economic growth, rebuilding a strong military, and promoting an America First energy policy. President Trump achieved positive outcomes on several domestic and international agendas related to his campaign pledges to rebuild the US and create jobs. In this regard, he actively pushed ahead with hardline immigration policies and tax reforms. The approval of the tax reform bill in December led to further consolidation of domestic support.

 As for other major international developments, the Middle East became somewhat stable with Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), an extremist Islamic militant group, being finally defeated at the end of 2017. Still, elements of instability related to Syria, lsrael-Palestine relations, and the Kurd issue continued to manifest. Meanwhile in Europe, the anti-globalization sentiment, represented by Great Britain's decision to withdraw from the European Union (Brexit) in 2016, intensified and the shift to right-wing politics became prominent in the face of difficult challenges of refugees and terrorism triggered by the Syrian crisis.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration set reviving the economy and rebuilding the military strength of the US as major goals of its foreign policy. While continuing to strengthen its defense capabilities, the US emphasized the importance of the

alliance network and promoted US leadership through role-sharing and cost-sharing with its allies. In December, the US announced its National Security Strategy (NSS),
which stipulated strengthening the defense of the US mainland, promoting national prosperity, maintaining peace through force, and enhancing US influence as the key security interests. In the trade sector, the US adopted protectionism based on the America First policy direction, such as announcing the withdrawal of the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) in January and launching the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in August, and actively pursued bilateral trade agreements with other countries. Amongst all these policy goals, the Trump administration placed top priority on resolving the North Korean nuclear issue. The Trump administration defined North Korea's nuclear weapons and missile development as a grave threat and sought a diplomatic solution through its policy of "maximum pressure and engagement."
The US economy continued to record a relatively high growth rate thanks to robust private consumption, increased corporate investment, strong employment, and tax cuts. Stock prices, including the Dow Jones Industrial Average, reached record highs, and the unemployment rate fell to their lowest levels in 17 years. The current account deficit expanded due to a slowdown in exports and imports even though consumer prices rose due to rising energy prices. 

In October 2017, China announced its new leadership lineup and policy for the next five years at the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party, the country's largest political event. At the Congress, China incorporated the "Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era" into the Constitution of the Communist Party, declared its entry into the New Era and announced China's pursuit of the Chinese Dream. In international affairs, China held the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation in May and strengthened its cooperation with BRICS
and other developing countries at the 9ª BRICS Summit in September. Regarding US-China relations, the bilateral relationship was smooth for some time since the inauguration of the Trump administration. Exchanges and economic cooperation between the leaders of the two countries continued, including President Xi Jinping's visit to the US in April, the establishment of the Comprehensive Economic Dialogue in July, and the signing of large-scale investment and purchase contracts by President Trump. The economy grew by 6.9%, which was higher than China's initial target of 6.5%, and rebounded in seven years since 2010. China's economic growth and employment were improved as a result of the economic recovery of developed countries, which were China's major export markets. 

In Japan, a school scandal had a detrimental effect on the support of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe which cost the Liberal Democratic Party the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly election held in July. However, the Liberal Democratic Party scored a major victory in November's general election, which led to the launching of the fourth Abe Cabinet. Abe continued his efforts on the constitutional amendment while promoting proactive contribution to peace and global overview diplomacy.

Japan also continued to strengthen cooperation with Australia, the ASEAN states, and the US, especially with the Trump administration. Japan's economy rebounded moderately as the yen weakened and stock prices continued to rise on the back of a five-year implementation of Abenomics and the easing of financial policy in particular. With its internal and external balance restored, Japan's real GDP growth rate reached 1.9%.

In Russia, the ruling United Russia Party won all 16 local government chiefs' elections in September 2017, following its landslide victory in the seventh general election in September 2016, which led to the solidification of Vladimir Putin's presidency. Meanwhile, the Russian economy, which had shown negative growth over the past two years due to falling oil prices since 2014 and the continuous economic sanctions by the West, grew by about 1.5%, owing to the gradual recovery in consumption and investment because of rising oil prices and falling inflation. There was a possibility of improving ties between the US and Russia and of easing sanctions against Russia after the inauguration of the Trump administration, but the confrontation between the two countries continued, with the US adopting the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act in August. On the other hand, China and Russia continued their high-level cooperation based on an overall and strategic cooperative partnership. The two countries held bilateral summits five times, including Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to Russia in July.

withdraw. In June, the Brexit negotiations officially began. In December, both sides agreed in principle on the rights of citizens, financial calculations, and the boundary issue of Ireland and Northern Ireland. However, further consultation was necessary regarding a specific implementation plan. Economic recovery was underway. The GDP
of the EU and Eurozone increased about 0.6% compared to the previous year. The unemployment rate began to stabilize downward and recorded approximately 9%.

In Europe, conservative swing, terrorism, and the separatist independence movement came to the fore. At the presidential election of France in April, a final ballot resulted in the middle of the road candidate Emmanuel Macron polling 24% of the vote and the extreme rightist candidate Marine Le Pen polling 21% of the vote.

Finally, Macron was elected which gave the impression of the rise of the extreme rightist in Europe being repressed. In the UK, as the Conservative and Unionist Party failed to occupy a majority of the seats of congress in the June general election, they stayed in power by forming a coalition with the Northern Irish political party, the Democratic Unionist Party. In Germany, a coalition of the Christian Democratic Union and the Christian Social Union led by Angela Merkel maintained the ruling party status after the general election of September but experienced difficulties in forming the coalition because of the lower-than-expected polling rate. Moreover, the influx of refugees caused concern for the electorate and a far-right political party, Alternative for Germany, which entered the national assembly for the first time and became the third biggest party in the Bundestag. Meanwhile, rapid progress of right wing parties was noticeable in Central and Eastern Europe. As a result of the general election of the Czech Republic in October, center-right party ANO polled almost 30% and became the ruling party. In the general election of Austria conducted in October, the center-right ruling party, the Austrian People's Party, formed a coalition with the far-right Freedom Party of Austria.

In 2017, terrorism occurred in various places of Europe such as Manchester, the In Southeast Asia, major economies experienced an economic growth of 5-6%,
especially in the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Indonesia. It is estimated the major economic policies of their governments achieved some degree of success. In particular, Vietnam's growth rate reached 6.8% based on a socioeconomic development strategy and the Philippines achieved a 6.7% growth rate through the "Dutertenomics" of President Rodrigo Duterte.

In Singapore, as a result of the 2017 presidential election, former National Assembly Speaker Halimah Yacob ran as a sole candidate and became the first female president. Thailand held a royal funeral of King Bhumibol Adulyadej in October and completed the year of mourning. The Philippine government declared martial law throughout Mindanao in May and conducted an operation to eliminate an ISIL-linked organization in Marawi City. In Myanmar, there were approximately 600,000 refugees in the Rakhine state with regard to which the UN Security Council adopted a Chairman Statement in November.

ASEAN celebrated its 50" anniversary in November and the 31" ASEAN Summit and related summits were held in Manila, the Philippines. At the ASEAN Summit, leaders discussed regional issues such as the Korean Peninsula, marine security, anti-terrorism, domestic refugee problems, transnational crime, trade protectionism, and the foundation of an ASEAN community. At the ASEAN+3 Summit, the leaders evaluated the 20" anniversary of cooperation in various fields such as finance and food security and reaffirmed the importance of cooperation on pursuing free trade and regional integration as protectionism and anti-globalization trends continued to spread. At the East Asia Summit, leaders discussed the challenges facing East Asia, including terrorism and violent extremism, anti-globalization, and the spread of London subway, Champ-Elysees, and Barcelona. Each country endeavored to build countermeasures against terrorism. Also, the Catalan independence movement continued and the Parliament of Catalonia unilaterally declared independence from Spain on October 27 and found the Catalan Republic. But, the Constitutional Court of Spain adjudged the declaration of the Parliament of Catalonia null and void on November 8, so the incident was settled for the time being. In March, the government of the United Kingdom officially informed the EU of their intention to

his successor and defense minister, as the Crown Prince in June. In addition, eight countries including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Egypt broke diplomatic relations with Qatar on the grounds of Qatar's support of terrorist organizations. Regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, there was a settlement agreement between Fatah and Hamas in October under the mediation of Egypt, but President Trump's recognition of the Israeli capital and relocation of the US Embassy to Jerusalem in December raised anti-American sentiment in Arab countries, including Palestine. Meanwhile, the economy of the Middle East recorded an economic growth rate of 3.2% in an atmosphere of rising international oil prices and the recovery of the world economy.

Australia maintained a stable economic growth rate of 2.8% year-on-year growth. In November, the Australian government released the first foreign policy white paper in 14 years, which stated that it will "promote an open, inclusive, and prosperous Indo-Pacific," while also strengthening and diversifying partnerships across the globe. In New Zealand, a labor-led government was launched in October and received a positive review for implementing the 100 day plan which was released as part of the Labor Party's policy during the 2017 election campaign.

The approval rating of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi increased to 65% in the beginning of the year, despite criticism of the currency reform in 2016. Based on his strong leadership, Modi introduced the integrated Value-Added Tax (VAT) system in July and set the stage for efficient economic reform in the future by unifying the VAT that was being imposed differently in 29 states. Meanwhile, the China-India relations sunk to its lowest level after 73 days of military confrontation, also known as the "Doklam Standoff," from June. The incident, triggered by road construction by Chinese troops in Doklam (China's Donglang) where the borders of China, India, and Bhutan meet, ended with a compromise between India and China.

While the Pink Tide in Latin America seemed to have ebbed away since 2015, the super election cycle during which major countries held presidential elections attracted changes in the political landscape of Latin America in 2017. The victory of Argentina's center-right governing coalition in the mid-term congressional election and right-wing governments assuming power in the presidential elections in Honduras and Chile worked to affirm the idea that left-wings were in decline. However, the left-wing candidate's victory in the Ecuadorian presidential election, the establishment of Venezuela's new constituent assembly in July, and the following landslide victory in the local elections in October despite the controversy over election fraud demonstrated the sustained power of Latin American leftists.

With increasing interest in political change in Latin America, corruption and The situation in the Middle East in 2017 evolved from a potential conflict, before the ISIS repulsion emerged, into a complex issue. In order to solve the Syrian problem, peace negotiations in Geneva were held five times, but no special progress was made between Syrian government forces and rebels. The Astana peace talks were held eight times led by Russia, Turkey, and Iran, leading to the agreement to set up "de-escalation zones." In April, the US raided the Syrian Air Force base in response to the use of chemical weapons by Syrian troops on the civil town of Khan Shaykhun. After the efforts of repelling ISIS of the international community, Haider al-Abadi, Prime Minister of Iraq, declared victory over ISIS in December following the withdrawal of troops from Mosul, ISIS's biggest focus city, in July. ISIS had continued to lose ground even in Syria.

distrust in existing political powers, rather than ideological confrontations between the left and right, played decisive roles in winning votes in major countries such as Columbia, Mexico, and Brazil, which will hold presidential elections. This is because of the repercussions from Brazil's Odebrecht bribery scandal, into which an investigation was launched from 2016, and growing public opinion criticizing corruption and established politicians around Latin America. Meanwhile, the growth rate of Latin America showed a recovery trend thanks to improvements in the world economy and commodity prices. Possible changes arising from the US including renegotiations of NAFTA, corporate tax reductions, and anti-immigrant policies Iranian President Hassan Rouhani was re-elected in May and Salman bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud, the King of Saudi Arabia, appointed Mohammad Bin Salman,

armed forces" in its official statement. This aimed to demonstrate North Korea's ability to strike the US mainland and gain recognition as nuclear state status from the international community.

In Africa, governance improved as a result of regular elections and a peaceful transfer of power. In Liberia's presidential election in December, the government achieved a regime change by democratic election - the first time since 1944 - by the election of opposition candidate senator George Weah. President Robert Mugabe, who has been in power for 37 years, withdrew from presidency in November with a peaceful military intervention and parliamentary impeachment initiative, and handed over power to Vice President Emmerson Mnangagwa.

However, political tension and confusion during the election and subsequent transfer of power occurred in some African countries, and political crises continued even in South Sudan, Central Africa, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo), and other countries.

Internally, after establishing a unitary rule system centered on Chairman Kim Jong-un at the 7ª Party Congress in 2016, North Korea focused on strengthening its internal crackdown while consolidating solidarity in 2017. North Korea concentrated its efforts on pursuing the Five-Year Strategy for National Economic Development established during the 7th Party Congress in 2016, and actively encouraged
"self-reliance" and principles based on a "mobilization of the entire nation." At the 200 plenary session of the 7th WPK Central Committee held in October 2017, the need to overcome strengthened international sanctions was emphasized and reshuffling the party elites on a large scale to brace itself was attempted. The North Korean economy focused on overcoming the chronic economic difficulties caused by the implementation of enormous sanctions imposed by the international community, including China. It devoted its efforts to exploiting and controlling the markets, finding new sources of foreign currency, and exporting to China.

Externally, North Korea's diplomatic isolation intensified, with the international Terrorist extremists such as al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb of North Africa, Boko Haram in West Africa, and Al-Shabaab in East Africa continued to pose a threat.

Somalia, South Sudan, Nigeria, and other countries faced serious humanitarian crises due to drought and food shortages resulting from political instability and an influx of refugees. Meanwhile, the economic growth rate in Sub-Saharan Africa was only 2.6%
due to the slowdown in global economic recovery, declining raw material prices, the spread of trade protection, instability in Africa, and other factors.

community tightening pressure on the communist state which caused a severance of diplomatic relations and deportation of ambassadors. Tension between North Korea and the US rose sharply since the inauguration of the Trump administration, and its relations with China were somewhat alienated as China joined the international community in imposing sanctions on North Korea. In addition, North Korea-Japan relations deteriorated due to North Korea's test-launch of missiles that flew over Japan. Nevertheless, it maintained relatively good bilateral relations with Russia by expanding personal exchanges (including high-level visits), increasing trade volume, and discussing the possibility of economic cooperation in East Asia.

In the meantime, the intensity of sanctions and pressure by the international community on North Korea's advancement of its nuclear and missile capabilities steadily increased. The United Nations Security Council unanimously adopted resolutions 2356 (June 2), 2371 (Aug. 5), 2375 (Sept. 11), and 2397 (Dec. 22) in North Korea continued to illegally develop nuclear weapons and missiles and conducted high-intensity provocations in 2017, as in the previous year. North Korea continuously advanced its nuclear capabilities by launching ballistic missiles 15 times, including three ICBM-class missiles, and conducting one nuclear test in 2017. The sixth nuclear test in September showed that North Korea's nuclear threats have become quite considerable. After launching a new ICBM-class ballistic missile Hwasong-15 on November 29, North Korea declared its "realization of [a] nuclear response to North Korea's sixth nuclear test and subsequent ICBM-class missile launches.

Sanctions by major countries also continued to expand. Since the inauguration of the Trump administration in 2017, the US designated eight additional independent sanctions and imposed secondary sanctions on foreign financial institutions through the introduction of a new executive order (No. 13810). Under such circumstances, there was an unprecedented sense of crisis on the Korean Peninsula, with some in the US raising the possibility of using military options.

Inter-Korean relations continued to be strained, despite the launch of the new government in the Republic of Korea, due to North Korea's continuous provocations and no response to the efforts of the Korean government. The Korean government continued to make efforts to improve inter-Korean relations while deterring North Korea's further provocations and bring North Korea to denuclearization talks. While firmly responding to North Korea's provocations, the Korean government continuously sought a peaceful resolution while managing the situation in a stable manner to prevent further escalation of tensions surrounding the Korean Peninsula. After the announcement of the Berlin Initiative in July, the Korean government presented the Policy for Peace on the Korean Peninsula by President Moon Jae-in and promoted awareness on the need for peace as well as for resuming inter-Korean dialogue and exchanges at every major occasion to the international community.

The Korean government made various efforts to encourage the participation of North Korea in the PyeongChang Winter Olympic Games through various channels while communicating closely with related countries, based on the idea that the PyeongChang Winter Olympic Games should be used as an opportunity to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue and establish peace on the Korean Peninsula.

The year 2017 was characterized by growing uncertainty in the international

![9_image_0.png](9_image_0.png)

![9_image_1.png](9_image_1.png) order amid increasing regional and global challenges. On the Korean Peninsula, the advancing nuclear and missile capabilities of North Korea and continuing provocations increased tensions in the Northeast Asian region, with competition among key countries deepening. The spread of global trade protectionism weakened the foundation for international cooperation. Domestically, the impeachment of the president led to the suspension of summit diplomacy for a number of months.

Against such a backdrop, the Moon Jae-in administration was launched on May 10, 2017, without any time to establish a presidential transition committee. In lieu of a presidential transition committee, the State Affairs Planning Advisory Committee presented the national vision "A Nation of the People; A Just Republic of Korea" and adopted 100 Policy Tasks to fulfill the vision. In the diplomatic field, the following six policy tasks were selected under the vision "Korean Peninsula of Peace and Prosperity": "To better protect Korean citizens overseas and expand support for other persons of Korean descent" (Task No.10), "To resolve the North Korean nuclear issue Chapter 2 Korea's Foreign Policy

peacefully and build a peace regime" (Task No.95), "To promote the national interest by reflecting public opinion in diplomacy and by supporting public diplomacy"
(Task No.96), "To cooperate diplomatically with the four countries whose interests converge on the Korean Peninsula" (Task No.97), "To create a responsible Northeast Asia Plus Community" (Task No.98), and "To strengthen economic diplomacy and development cooperation to advance national interests" (Task No.99). 

challenges for bilateral relations between Korea and China, the Korean government continued omnidirectional communication to restore relations to normal. As a result, following the announcement of the outcome of the consultations between the Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China on improving bilateral relations on October 31, President Moon made a state visit to China in December for the 25®
anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations. As a result, the groundwork for the recovery of trust and the restoration and development of exchanges and cooperation was laid to strengthen strategic communication regarding issues on the Korean Peninsula.

 In this context, the government of the Republic of Korea pursued the restoration of summit diplomacy with its neighboring four countries; the securing of momentum for peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula; the expansion of the horizons of diplomacy through diplomacy diversification with the New Southern Policy and New Northern policy; and diplomacy with the people.

With the two-track approach of simultaneous advancing of the addressing of historical issues on the basis of firm principles and the development of futureoriented relations, Korea exerted efforts to build a foundation for the improvement and enhancement of relations between Korea and Japan. While the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) of the Republic of Korea implemented firm measures regarding historical issues such as the Japanese political leaders' visits to the Yasukuni Shrine (a symbol of Japan's imperialism which glorifies Japan's military aggression in the past), agreement on strengthening substantive cooperation was also pursued including the restoration of shuttle diplomacy; close cooperation regarding North Korea's provocations and nuclear program; and exchanges in the economic, cultural, and people-to-people fields.

Taking the opportunity of the summit on the occasion of the Eastern Economic Soon after the launch of the new Korean government, the Moon Jae-in administration restored foreign relations to normal and restored summit diplomacy interrupted by the impeachment. President Moon Jae-in established a foundation for the development of bilateral relations with the Republic of Korea's four neighboring countries through summits held over a time of about seven months including three with the US, two with Japan, three with China, and two with Russia.

Forum in September, the leaders of Korea and Russia expressed their will to greatly promote bilateral relations. Above all, President Moon presented the New Northern Policy which underscores the 9-Bridge Strategy (gas, railways, ports, power generation, Arctic shipping routes, shipbuilding, agriculture, fisheries, and industrial complex). The two countries decided to cooperate closely for the development of the Far East region and co-prosperity of the Eurasian region. To this end, they also agreed to establish the Presidential Committee on Northern Economic Cooperation, and the ROK-Russia forum for provisional cooperation to enhance bilateral cooperation.

The leaders of Korea and the US strengthened the close trust and friendship through the exchange of state visits between the countries and frequent contact. Apart from the channels between leaders, various high-level committees including foreign ministerial talks and the Extended Deterrence Strategy and Consultation Group (EDSCG) were held to lay a firm basis for coordinated policy. This close cooperation generated impetus for North Korea's participation in the PyeongChang Winter Olympic Games, the Inter-Korean Summit, and North Korea-US Summit. 

Although the differences in positions regarding THAAD deployment posed

## 2 Securing Momentum For Peace And Stability On The Korean Peninsula � Expanding The Diplomatic Horizons Through Diversification Of Diplomacy

In such ways the Korean government fostered the conditions, shortly after the launch of the Moon Jae-in administration, for a leading role in resolving Korean Peninsula issues by actively restoring summit diplomacy and maintaining close and strategic communication with its neighboring four countries: the US, China, Japan, and Russia. Against the backdrop of North Korea having tested a series of ballistic missiles early in the year, the Moon Jae-in administration was launched amid a grave security environment and declared the resolution of the security crisis and the establishment of peace on the Korean Peninsula as top priorities.

Amid radical changes in the security environment on the Korean Peninsula and in Northeast Asia, the ROK government exerted continued efforts to expand the scope of diplomacy beyond Northeast Asia. Shortly after the inauguration, President Moon Jae-in emphasized the need for diplomatic diversification to expand the ties of cooperation to encompass a greater number of countries and sent special envoys to not only the neighboring four countries but also various regions including the EU, ASEAN, Latin America, and the Caribbean for the first time. Beginning with his visit to the US in June 2017, the President conducted active summit diplomacy around the world including a visit to Germany to participate in the G20 Summit in July, visit to Russia in September and attendance at the UN General Assembly in September, tour of Southeast Asian countries in November, and visit to China in December. 

The ROK government presented the vision for regional cooperation of promoting President Moon Jae-in presented the vision of "peaceful co-existence" and
"co-prosperity" in his speech on the 17th anniversary of the June 15 Inter-Korean Summit and at the Körber Foundation in Germany on July 6, 2017. From the announcement of the policy vision, the ROK government actively presented its position of promoting engagement along with sanctions and pressure against North Korea's provocations. In addition, the ROK government also exerted a variety of government-wide diplomatic efforts in order to realize North Korea's participation in the PyeongChang Winter Olympic Games as one of the practical means for securing momentum for peace and dialogue.

co-prosperity beyond Northeast Asia with Eurasia, ASEAN, and India by announcing the New Northern Policy on the occasion of the state visit to Russia in September and the New Southern Policy during the tour of Southeast Asian countries. Regarding the New Northern Policy and agreeing on strengthening the basis for substantive cooperation with Russia as a strategic partner, the ROK government established the Korea-Central Asia Cooperation Forum Secretariat, an institutional foundation for enhancing bilateral and multilateral cooperation with five countries of Central Asia including Uzbekistan. For the New Southern Policy, the government presented the goal of implementing 3Ps (people, prosperity, and peace) in a Korea-ASEAN 
community in which all thrive and decided to strengthen relations to promote ASEAN as Korea's core cooperation partner with the aim of achieving US$200 billion in trade by 2020.

As a result, the international community expressed its support for the ROK's policy towards North Korea at various meetings such as the ARF, EAS, and ASEAN+3, and the UN General Assembly adopted the Olympic Truce Resolution by consensus to create an atmosphere conducive to North Korea's return to dialogue.

Through these continued efforts in close communication and solid cooperation with the international community to send the message for dialogue the ROK
government laid a foundation to encourage a change in approach on the part of North Korea.

Moreover, the ROK government made efforts to expand cooperation for co-existence and co-prosperity with Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean, Africa, and the Middle East through active high-level exchanges for deepening

ensure their safety and assist in their return in cases of major accidents and incidents overseas such as the Las Vegas shooting in October and Bali volcano eruption in November. Moreover, MOFA further bolstered the basis to secure the safety of overseas Koreans by enhancing the infrastructure for their protection. To that end, MOFA reorganized and expanded its bureau into an Overseas Koreans and Consular Affairs Office, established a Safety Center for Overseas Koreans which operates 24 hours a day year round, and increased the number of consular staff in charge of handling accidents and incidents abroad from 65 to 104.

The ROK government, setting diplomatic diversification as an important goal, also intensified multilateral cooperation to complement the bilateral diplomacy, increasing the number of partners for cooperation in the international community.

President Moon sought to enhance Korea's role and prestige in the international community, attending major multilateral summits such as the June G20 Summit in Hamburg, the 72nd Session of the UN General Assembly, and the November APEC
Summit in Da Nang.

Moreover, the ROK government made efforts to both support overseas Korean nationals and further improve consular services. Following the launch of the Moon Jae-in administration during overseas visits the government held meetings with Korean nationals, on a total of 10 occasions, to promote communication with communities of Korean nationals. In addition, MOFA proceeded with the establishment of the G4K (Government for Overseas Koreans), a comprehensive electronic administration system for overseas nationals, to be launched in 2020.

By participating in these summits, the ROK government responded to and countered the spread of trade protectionism by actively participating in global economic cooperation and announcing support for trade multilateralism; enhanced Korea's role as a responsible middle power country playing a part in resolving global pending issues such as peace, human rights, climate change, development, arms control, and counter-terrorism; expanded Korea's role in the international community by increasing humanitarian assistance; and fostered an atmosphere for the holding of the Olympics of Peace by encouraging the attention and participation of various countries in the PyeongChang Winter Olympic Games.

Finally, recognizing the importance of consolidated support of the people for foreign policy through smooth communication between the government and the people, the ROK government sought to lay a foundation for Participatory Diplomacy to more systematically reflect the views of the people in foreign policy.

For the goal of launching the Center for Participatory Diplomacy in 2018, consensus on Participatory Diplomacy was secured through research on initiatives pursued by other countries, measures to promote the participation of civil society, and close consultations with the National Assembly, academia, and relevant authorities.

The ROK government, recognizing that the ultimate goal of foreign policy is to promote the national interest and that the national interest and the people are inseparably intertwined, placed great focus on protection of and communication with the people. To protect overseas Korean nationals, MOFA quickly took action to

resolving issues concerning the Korean Peninsula. In this regard, President Moon's policy initiative was presented in his speech at the Körber Foundation in Germany on July 6, 2017, under the title of the Berlin Initiative.

Under the vision of "peaceful coexistence" and "co-prosperity," the Berlin lnitiative consists of five pillars of policy guidelines and four practical proposals aimed at establishing peace on the Korean Peninsula. The five pillars of policy guidelines are: pursuit of peace which neither involves North Korea's collapse nor artificial unification; denuclearization that guarantees security of the North Korean

regime; enactment of the inter-Korean agreements into law and conclusion of a peace agreement with the participation of relevant countries; working toward drawing a new economic map on the Korean Peninsula; and consistent pursuit of nonpolitical exchanges and cooperation projects. The four practical proposals include: family reunions and visits to ancestral graves on October 4; North Korea's participation in the PyeongChang Winter Olympic Games; mutual halt of hostile acts around the Military Demarcation Line; and resumption of inter-Korean dialogue.

Since the announcement of the Berlin Initiative, the ROK government actively engaged in an outreach campaign to gain international support for the initiative.

lt held briefings for the diplomatic corps in Korea on July 13-14 and 18-19, respectively, and presented the government's position at various bilateral and multilateral meetings.

Early in 2017, North Korea tested a series of ballistic missiles including Pukkuksong-2 on February 12 and Hwasong-12 on May 14. In response to North Korea's continued provocations, the international community consistently heightened the level of sanctions and pressure against North Korea through measures such as the UN Security Council resolutions. With the start of the Moon Jae-in administration amid a grave security environment, it declared the resolution of the security crisis and the establishment of peace on the Korean Peninsula top priorities.

As a result, the international community expressed its support for the ROK's Korean Peninsula policy in various documents such as the Chairman's Statement of the ARF Foreign Ministers' Meeting (Aug. 7), ROK-Indonesia Joint Vision Statement for Co-Prosperity and Peace (Nov. 10), Chairman's Statement of the ROK-ASEAN 
Summit (Nov. 13), Chairman's Statement of the East Asia Summit (Nov. 14), and Chairman's Statement of the ASEAN+3 Summit (Nov. 14).

 On June 15, President Moon, in his address commemorating the 17th anniversary of the June 15 Inter-Korean Summit, expressed his commitment to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue in a peaceful manner and to improve inter-Korean relations, while pledging that the Republic of Korea would play a leading role in

During his congratulatory remarks at the WTF World Taekwondo Championships
(Muju, June 2017), President Moon proposed for the first time that North Korea participate in the PyeongChang Winter Olympic Games. President Moon enhanced the international community's understanding of this proposal and called for its interest and support to turn the proposal into a reality at major international occasions such as his official visit to Germany (July), the G20 Summit (July), the 72nd UN General Assembly (Sept.), and the ROK-ASEAN/ASEAN+3 Summit and East Asia Summit (Nov.).

· Chairman's Statement of the 24th ARF Foreign Ministers' Meeting (Aug. 7)
Some ministers also expressed support for the initiatives to improve inter-Korean relations and to establish permanent peace on the Korean Peninsula.

- ROK-Indonesia Joint Vision Statement for Co-prosperity and Peace (Nov. 10) 
President Joko Widodo supported the efforts of the Republic of Korea to improve inter-Korean relations and establish permanent peace on the Korean Peninsula.

President Joko Widodo also supported the ROK's leading role in fostering an environment for peaceful unification of the Korean Peninsula and expressed support for President Moon's endeavors to restore inter-Korean dialogue on issues, including relieving tensions on the Korean Peninsula and resolving humanitarian issues between the two Koreas.

The ROK government aimed to foster a positive atmosphere for the successful hosting of the PyeongChang Winter Olympic Games and to secure international support for North Korea's participation by utilizing various opportunities such as the ASEAN Foreign Ministers' Meeting (Aug.), foreign ministers' meetings held on the occasion of the UN General Assembly (Sept.) and the ASEM Foreign Ministers' Meeting (Nov.), the bilateral policy planning consultations and strategic dialogues, and the Korean Peninsula Roundtable.

We supported initiatives to improve inter-Korean relations towards establishing peace in the Korean Peninsula and noted the latest initiative of the Republic of Korea proposed on 6 July 2017 in Berlin.

- Chairman's Statement of the 12° East Asia Summit (Nov. 14) 
We expressed support for initiatives to improve inter-Korean relations toward establishing permanent peace in the Korean Peninsula.

In addition, through the diplomatic corps in the ROK, the government continued efforts to create an atmosphere conducive to North Korea's participation in the PyeongChang Winter Olympic Games and to enhance the international community's understanding by holding a briefing session (Oct. 20) on the PyeongChang Winter Olympic Games attended by approximately 90 diplomatic missions in the ROK; a roundtable discussion (Oct. 31) for the heads of missions of EU members in the ROK; a briefing session (Dec. 7-8) for missions in the ROK covering both the ROK and North Korea (21 countries); and for missions in the ROK that also have permanent missions in North Korea (21 countries).

We expressed support for initiatives to improve inter-Korean relations toward establishing permanent peace in the Korean Peninsula. We also shared the view that the upcoming PyeongChang Winter Olympic Games could serve as a useful occasion to promote peace and stability in the Korean Peninsula.

As a result of these efforts, the UN General Assembly adopted the Olympic Truce Resolution by consensus (Nov. 13), and the language presented by the ROK, "the PyeongChang Winter Olympic Games could serve as a useful occasion to promote peace and stability in the Korean Peninsula," was reflected in the outcome documents of the ROK-ASEAN Summit (Nov. 13), the East Asia Summit (Nov. 14), the ASEAN+3 Summit (Nov. 14), and the ASEM Foreign Ministers' Meeting (Nov. 21).

The ROK government exerted a variety of government-wide diplomatic efforts, including summit diplomacy, in order to achieve one of the four practical proposals of the Berlin Initiative, North Korea's Participation in the PyeongChang Winter Olympic Games.

## 3) Efforts To Improve Human Rights In North Korea And Humanitarian Assistance To North Korea 4) North Korean Refugees

The ROK government contributed to the international community's efforts to improve human rights in North Korea, maintaining the basic position that the universal values and international norms of respecting human dignity must be observed throughout the Korean Peninsula.

A resolution on human rights in North Korea proposed by 61 countries, including the ROK, was adopted by consensus at the UN General Assembly's Third Committee (Nov.) and Plenary Meeting (Dec.). The ROK government continued its bilateral and multilateral efforts to improve human rights in North Korea by participating in the 3td ROK-US Consultation on North Korean Human Rights (Mar.)
and the 6th Annual Like-Minded Meeting on North Korean Human Rights and Humanitarian Assistance (Oct.).

To prevent the forced repatriation of North Korean refugees, the ROK government continued to stress the necessity of abiding by the principle of non-refoulement at bilateral and multilateral meetings. The government included a clause which urges all states to abide by the principle of non-refoulement into the resolution on human rights in North Korea, which was adopted at the 72ºº UN General Assembly's Third Committee (Nov.) and Plenary Meeting (Dec.). The ROK government also stressed the importance of abiding by the principle of non-refoulement at various occasions such as the 68th Session of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Standing Committee (Mar. 14-16) and the 69th Session of the UNHCR Standing Committee (June 28-30).

 Furthermore, as part of efforts to substantially improve the standard of living of North Koreans, the ROK government decided to grant US$8 million in humanitarian aid to North Korea through international organizations such as the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and World Food Programme (WFP) in September at the 286" Inter-Korean Exchange and Cooperation Promotion Council. The actual timing and scale of support would be decided upon comprehensively taking into consideration the overall conditions including inter-Korean relations.

In addition, the ROK government has been continuously working to improve various welfare services to ensure the mental and physical well-being of North Korean refugees while they await their transfer to the ROK. Moreover, as they enter the ROK, the ROK government provides them with assistances such as resettlement funds, housing placement services, and education on social adaptation programs as well as vocational training to help them adapt to the new environment in a swift and stable manner.

As of the end of December 2017, a total of 31,339 North Korean refugees entered the ROK.

 Under the policy that the ROK government, in principle, accommodates all the North Korean refugees who wish to come to the ROK of their own free will, it maintains close cooperation with the countries in which North Korean refugees are staying, as well as with the relevant international organizations.

## 2 Efforts To Establish Peace On The Korean Peninsula And Foster An Environment For Peaceful Unification 1) Strengthening Communication With Key Players For The Rok'S Policy On North Korea By Restoring Summit Diplomacy 2) Expanding Consensus In The International Community On The Rok'S Policy Toward North Korea And Building International Networks

At the bilateral summit held on the occasion of the G20 Summit (July), the Eastern Economic Forum (Sept.), and the East Asia Summit (Nov.), the ROK and Russia, based on their common understanding of maintaining peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula, engaged in in-depth discussions on the situation on the Korean Peninsula and agreed to work together, maintaining their firm will, toward the resolution of the North Korean nuclear issue.

Since the launch of the new administration, the ROK government quickly restored summit diplomacy and strengthened strategic communication with key players in order to deepen the international community's understanding and secure support for the ROK's policy on North Korea.

Furthermore, the ROK engaged in active diplomatic efforts at the summit level to secure international support for the ROK's policy on North Korea through overseas trips (Germany, Indonesia), meetings with heads of states during their visits to the ROK (Belgium, Uzbekistan, Sri Lanka, Turkey, etc.) and summit meetings (EU, UK, France, Germany, Italy, the Czech Republic, Australia, Canada, India, Vietnam, Mongolia, Singapore, the Philippines, Senegal, etc.) on the occasions of various multilateral meetings including the G20 Summit, the APEC Summit, the ASEAN Summit, as well as the UN General Assembly.

President Moon paid an official visit to the United States (June) which marked his first overseas trip, and US President Donald Trump made a state visit to the ROK,
the first state visit by a US President in 25 years (Nov.). Through the Joint Statement between the ROK and the US (June 30) and Joint Press Release by the ROK and the US (Nov. 8), which were respectively announced during these visits, the two countries reaffirmed their close cooperation for the resolution of North Koreanrelated issues, including the policy on North Korea.

 At the bilateral talks held on the occasion of the G20 Summit (July) and the Eastern Economic Forum (Sept.), the ROK and Japan agreed to enhance their understanding on issues concerning the Korean Peninsula and to strengthen cooperation. In particular, through the ROK-US-Japan Summit Meetings held on the occasion of the G20 Summit and the UN General Assembly (Sept.), the three sides committed to cooperate closely on North Korean issues.

In 2017, following the launch of the new administration, the ROK government held the Korean Peninsula Roundtable on 25 occasions in order to enhance understanding among overseas opinion leaders on issues concerning the Korean Peninsula as well as to gain support for ROK's policy toward North Korea. By particularly reaching out to countries such as Cambodia, Nicaragua, and Mongolia, which had traditionally maintained friendly relations with North Korea, the ROK
government emphasized the grave threat that North Korea's nuclear and missile development pose to world peace, while striving to generate a consensus on the peaceful resolution of the North Korean nuclear issue and the need to establish permanent peace on the Korean Peninsula.

 The ROK and China strengthened their strategic communication regarding the Korean Peninsula through bilateral talks held on the occasion of multilateral summits including the G20 Summit (July), the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit (Nov.), and the ASEAN+3 Summit (Nov.). During President Moon's state visit to China on December 13-16, the two sides affirmed their common understanding of the need to improve inter-Korean relations and the principle of resolving issues on the Korean Peninsula through dialogue and negotiation.

In this regard, the ROK government continued to work with regional countries

## � North Korea'S Nuclear And Missile Threats And Escalation Of Tension On The Korean Peninsula

by participating in the annual Northeast Asia Cooperation Dialogue (NEACD), a track 1.5 multilateral security dialogue in Northeast Asia. At the 27th NEACD held in Singapore on July 11-12, the ROK government engaged in discussions on the North Korean nuclear issue with the parties to the Six-Party Talks other than North Korea and enhanced the understanding of major neighboring countries of the ROK's policy toward North Korea.

Chapter 2 Moreover, the ROK government worked toward strengthening its network with countries which had experienced unification and regime transition. In order to share Germany's experience of peaceful unification and to draw policy implications, the ROK government held the 5th Korean-German Advisory Group Meeting on Unification Foreign Policy and issued a report on the results of the group's activities including discussions and policy suggestions. Furthermore, the ROK government held the 4th ROK-Visegrad Group Seminar with the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia (V4), which shared the countries' experiences regarding regime transition.

Despite the Korean government's efforts to halt North Korea's acts of provocation and promote peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula, North Korea's nuclear and missile development and provocations continued well into 2017.

Starting with the launch of the Pukkuksong-2 on February 12, North Korea launched a total of 20 ballistic missiles in 2017 alone. North Korea also conducted its sixth nuclear test in September 2017.

A large majority of the missiles that North Korea launched in 2017 were newly developed ballistic missiles that were previously not made public. They included IRBMs (Hwasong-12), SLBMs (Pukkuksong-2), and ballistic missiles with ICBM range (Hwasong-14, Hwasong-15). The international community's concerns over North Korea's missile program deepened as North Korea's delivery systems became more diversified and its missile ranges increased dramatically.

Accordingly, the international community imposed much stronger sanctions and

pressure on North Korea. The United Nations Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 2356 (June 2), Resolution 2371 (Aug. 5), Resolution 2375 (Sept. 11), and

Resolution 2397 (Dec. 22) in response to North Korea's sixth nuclear test and its ICBM launches (24 rounds in 2016 and 20 rounds in 2017). As a result, the sanctions package on North Korea became the strongest-ever. The sanctions package included the ban on North Korean raw materials exports such as coal and iron ore, which was accepted as an exception in the previous sanctions, the ban on North Korean seafood exports, limiting work permits for North Korean workers, limiting oil supply to the DPRK, expanding the list of banned import and export items from and to North Korea, and blocking all traffic entering North Korean ports. Furthermore, members of the international community, such as the US, Japan, and the EU, also imposed bilateral sanctions on North Korea.

As the international community's sanctions and pressure on North Korea intensified, so did the level of North Korea's threatening language. On August 8, in a statement by the Korean People's Army Strategic Forces, North Korea threatened to consider "enveloping fire at the areas around Guam." Moreover, on September 21, at the margins of the United Nations General Assembly, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho voiced the possibility of a "hydrogen bomb test above the Pacific Ocean." On November 29, North Korea conducted a test launch of its newly developed ballistic missile with ICBM range (Hwasong-15) and proclaimed to have
"finally realized the great historic cause of completing the state nuclear force."
Due to North Korea's repeated acts of provocation and threatening rhetoric, the situation on the Korean Peninsula grew more unstable, and some within the US
began to raise the possible use of military force. This led to an unprecedentedly heightened sense of crisis.

## 2 Launch Of The Moon Jae-In Administration And Its Efforts To Resolve The North Korean Nuclear Issue

The Moon Jae-in administration commenced in May 2017, amid rising tensions on the Korean Peninsula due to North Korea's continued acts of provocation. The administration designated the peaceful resolution of the North Korean nuclear issue as its foreign policy priority, and proclaimed three policy goals: Resolution of the

North Korean Nuclear Issue, Establishment of Lasting Peace, and Development of Sustainable Inter-Korean Relations and Realization of a New Economic Community on the Korean Peninsula, along with its vision of "A Peaceful and Prosperous Korean Peninsula."
Soon after its launch, the Moon administration sent special envoys to the US,
China, Japan, and Russia, as well as to the EU and ASEAN to explain its strategy for establishing peace on the Korean Peninsula and its overall policy direction on North Korea, thereby garnering support from the international community and ending a long hiatus in Korea's summit diplomacy.

The Moon administration set forth its blueprint for a "Korean Peninsula where South and North acknowledge and respect each other, and prosper together without threat of nuclear weapons or war." The administration devoted its diplomatic efforts to bring about a change in North Korea's behavior, while at the same time, responding firmly to North Korea's acts of provocation.

On July 6, President Moon delivered a speech at the Körber Foundation in Germany, and proclaimed the Vision for the Korean Peninsula Peace Initiative, which is widely known as the Berlin Initiative. In his speech, President Moon declared that the ROK government would pursue the establishment of a permanent peace regime and denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula which would guarantee the security of the North Korean regime. Furthermore, President Moon mentioned that he was ready to meet with Chairman Kim Jong-un of North Korea at any time at any place if the right conditions were met and if the meeting could provide an opportunity to transform the current pattern of tension and confrontation on the Korean Peninsula.

Based on its coherent and consistent policy strategy towards North Korea, the Korean government continued to strengthen its cooperation with the international community with regard to a peaceful resolution of the North Korean nuclear issue. The government further enhanced ROK-US cooperation and encouraged neighboring countries such as China, Japan and Russia to play constructive roles in resolving issues concerning North Korea.

## 1) Maintaining Close Rok-Us Cooperation On North Korean Issues

In June 2017, President Moon travelled to the United States for his first overseas visit since his inauguration in May and held his first summit meeting with US President Donald Trump. The two leaders signed a joint declaration and agreed on the principle of resolving the North Korean nuclear issue in a peaceful manner, while at the same time sharing the view that maximum pressure on North Korea was necessary to urge North Korea to engage in denuclearization talks. Furthermore, the two leaders expressed that they were willing to talk with North Korea under the right circumstances. The Moon administration gained President Trump's full support for its policy direction on resolving the North Korean nuclear issue.

Following the summit meeting, the two Presidents maintained close communication on various occasions, including President Trump's state visit to the ROK in November, and the ROK-US summit on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in September, and a series of consultations between the foreign ministers and representatives to the Six-Party Talks of the two countries took place. Through these discussions, the ROK government has continuously coordinated and developed a joint strategy to address the North Korean nuclear issue.

Upon President Trump's state visit to the Republic of Korea in November, the two leaders reiterated their determination to cooperate closely for a peaceful resolution of the North Korean nuclear issue and reaffirmed their principle to maintain sanctions and pressure on North Korea in order to steer North Korea in the direction of meaningful negotiations.

Moreover, the Foreign Ministers of the two countries met whenever necessary to hold in-depth discussions on ways to resolve the issues concerning North Korea. The two ministers reaffirmed the principle regarding a peaceful resolution of the North Korean nuclear issue, while developing plans to guide North Korea to the negotiation table. At the same time, they shared the belief that the Republic of Korea and the United Sates need to play a leading role in consolidating cooperation with the international community and encouraging neighboring countries such as China

## And Russia To Play A Constructive Role. 2) Close Communication And Cooperation With Other Countries 3) Securing Support For The Rok'S Policy Towards North Korea On The International Stage

the Korean government's efforts to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue and its stance on improving inter-Korean relations. Based on their shared understanding, the two countries decided to further strengthen their strategic communication and cooperation with respect to the North Korean nuclear issue.

The Republic of Korea places high importance on close cooperation between the Republic of Korea, the United States, and Japan, as well as ROK-US cooperation.

During the ROK-US-Japan trilateral summits, which took place on the occasion of the G20 Summit in July and the UN General Assembly in September, the leaders of the three countries reaffirmed their principle regarding denuclearization of North Korea, and consulted on a joint policy direction to achieve this goal. Following the ROK-US summit in June 2017, President Moon held summit meetings with leaders of other countries including Japan (July, Sept.), China (July, Nov., Dec.), and Russia (July, Sept.), to share a common understanding on the gravity of North Korea's nuclear and missile threats and to gain their support for a peaceful resolution of the North Korean nuclear issue.

During the ROK-Japan summit meetings, which took place in July and September, respectively, the two leaders shared their views on the urgency of the North Korean nuclear and missile threats, and agreed to continue to strengthen ROK-Japan and ROK-US-Japan cooperation to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue in a peaceful manner.

At the same time, the Korean government continued its strategic communication with China and Russia so as to encourage them to continue playing constructive roles. During the ROK-China summit on the occasion of President Moon's state visit to China in December, the two leaders agreed on four principles to ensure peace and security on the Korean Peninsula: (1) War on the Korean Peninsula will never be tolerated, (2) The principle of denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula will be firmly held, (3) All issues are to be resolved peacefully through dialogue and negotiations, and (4) Improvement of inter-Korean relations will ultimately contribute to resolving issues on the Korean Peninsula. Furthermore, during the ROK-Russia summit, which took place in September, Russia demonstrated its understanding and support for The Korean government made use of major multi-lateral meetings such as the United Nations General Assembly, G20, and ASEAN as an opportunity to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue. At the meetings, the Korean government prompted North Korea to alter its behavior into a more forward-looking one. At the same time, the Korean government helped other countries develop a better understanding of the ROK's North Korea policy and strived to gain support from a greater number of countries.

At the G20 Summit, which took place in Germany in July 2017, President Moon defined North Korea's nuclear weapons and missile development as grave threats to world peace, and underlined the importance of the international community's joint response. President Moon also urged North Korea to halt its acts of provocation and to return to the negotiation table. These remarks by President Moon gained wide support from leaders of the G20 member countries.

 Furthermore, at the 8th Forum for the East Asia-Latin America Cooperation (FEALAC)
Foreign Ministerial Meeting, the ministers adopted the Busan Declaration, which was the first-ever declaration adopted in FEALAC to include an explicit clause condemning North Korea's nuclear development. At the same time, in August 2017, member countries of the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), the only regional security forum in which North Korea participates, expressed grave concern over North Korea's acts of provocation and adopted the Chairman's Statement which specified
"Complete, Verifiable, Irreversible Denuclearization" (CVID).

## Efforts To Establish Conditions For A Peaceful Resolution Of The North Korean Nuclear Issue

As previously discussed, the Korean government employed a consistent and coherent strategy towards North Korea and cooperated closely with the international community including the United States, China, Japan, and Russia in order to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue peacefully. Based on its close cooperation with other countries, the Korean government made diplomatic efforts to urge North Korea to engage in meaningful dialogue and to open up a new phase of the denuclearization process.

First, the Korean government conveyed a coherent message that North Korea would have a brighter future once it gave up its nuclear weapons. Meanwhile, it persistently urged North Korea to halt its acts of provocation and to promptly engage in meaningful dialogue. Amid a lull in North Korea's strategic provocations, which came after North Korea's sixth nuclear test in September 2017, the Moon administration expedited its diplomatic moves to find a breakthrough in the North Korean nuclear issue.

In particular, the Korean government, based on its initiatives to utilize the PyeongChang Winter Olympic Games as an opportunity to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue and establish peace on the Korean Peninsula, conveyed a consistent message through various channels to encourage North Korea's participation in the PyeongChang Winter Olympic Games, while maintaining close communication with other countries. At the same time, North Korea's contact with the international community continued to expand as foreign dignitaries made a series of visits to North Korea. Song Tao, Chinese envoy to North Korea, visited Pyeongyang in November, and Jeffrey Feltman, UN Under-Secretary-General, and Kent Härstedt, Swedish envoy to North Korea, visited Pyeongyang in December.

Although these efforts to make progress were met with certain challenges, including North Korea's launch of a ballistic missile with ICBM range on November 29, 2017, the Korean government carried out its initiatives unwaveringly, through close cooperation with the international community including the US, China, Japan, and Russia. Furthermore, the Korean government maintained a firm stance on its willingness to engage in a range of interactions with North Korea, as long as those engagements would serve the purpose of denuclearization in a peaceful manner, and concentrated its diplomatic efforts to use the PyeongChang Winter Olympic Games as an opportunity to resolve issues concerning North Korea. Such efforts strengthened the leading role of the Korean government as well as the diplomatic efforts of the international community. In late November, North Korea halted its acts of provocation, and the successful hosting of the PyeongChang Winter Olympic Games laid the groundwork for future progress in resolving issues on the Korean Peninsula.

Chapter 3 Enhancing and Deepening the ROK-US Strategic Alliance in a Mutually Beneficial Way

Resumption of ROK-US Summit Diplomacy and Enhancing and Developing the ROK-US Comprehensive Strategic Alliance In 2017, the ROK and the US governments engaged in active summit diplomacy from the beginning of the launch of their governments. The ROK President Moon Jae-in had his first phone call with US President Donald Trump on May 10, immediately after assuming office as President, and sent a Special Envoy to the US to call on President Trump, reaffirming the two leaders' strong commitment to bilateral cooperation.

When President Moon visited Washington in June, he held a successful summit with President Trump and they adopted the ROK-US Joint Statement, which presented the direction for advancing the ROK-US alliance. Through the statement, the two leaders reaffirmed their

commitment to advancing the exemplary alliance between the ROK and the US into an even greater alliance and also agreed on further cooperation on security and national defense, economy, and global issues. The two leaders also shared the view on the principles and direction for addressing the North Korean issue, and the ROK government secured the support of the US government for its policy towards North Korea.

The two leaders held a bilateral summit meeting on the occasion of the UN
General Assembly in September, and President Trump paid a state visit to the ROK
in November, which was the first state visit by a US President in 25 years. During the visit, President Trump visited Camp Humphreys in Pyeongtaek with President Moon, had a summit meeting, held a Joint Press Conference, attended a state banquet, gave a speech to the National Assembly, and laid a wreath at the National Cemetery. The two leaders issued the ROK-US Joint Press Release following the summit, which reiterated and elaborated on the key elements of the ROK-US Joint Statement adopted in June.

Vice President Mike Pence visited Korea in April, which was his first visit to East Asia. This was followed by other US high officials' visits, including Secretary of State Rex Tillerson (Mar.) and Secretary of Defense James Mattis (Feb. and Oct.). Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha visited the US in September and strengthened ROK-US
policy cooperation through discussions with high-level US administration officials and congressional leaders. The two governments closely communicated through channels at various levels to discuss related issues, including the enhancement of the ROK-US alliance, cooperation in addressing North Korean issues, and the economy and trade.

to the US, created a synergy effect. For example, President Moon Jae-in visited the United States in June and held meetings with leaders in the Senate and the House of Representatives. Moreover, Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-hwa met with some 30 members of Congress when she paid a visit to Washington, DC in September.

Moreover, a number of members of the US Congress visited Korea, and many of their visits were supported by the Congressional Member Exchange Program
(CMEP) of the Korean government. For example, Representative Tom Marino and Representative Tom MacArthur, as invitees to this program, visited Seoul in April and October, respectively. Along with the congressional visits through the CMEP,
a total of 44 members of Congress visited Korea in 2017, including Senator Cory Gardner, Chairman of the Subcommittee on East Asia, The Pacific and International Cybersecurity (in May), Representative Mac Thornberry, Chairman of the Armed Services Committee (in May), Senator Richard Durbin, Minority Whip, Representative Ed Royce, Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, and many other long-serving, influential members from both the Senate and the House of Representatives. A large number of Korean lawmakers including leaders of major political parties visited Capitol Hill, playing an important role in furthering exchanges between the Korean National Assembly and the United States Congress.

Based on the understanding of and support for Korea's foreign and security policies by US members of Congress, which was consolidated through expanded people-to-people exchanges with their Korean counterparts, in 2017 various bills and resolutions were proposed and passed on Korea-related issues such as the ROK-US alliance and the North Korean nuclear program. Senator John McCain, Chairman of the Armed Services Committee, and 18 other senators introduced a bill welcoming President Moon's first visit to the United States. In addition, the House of Representatives passed a resolution condemning North Korea's development of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) proposed by Representative Joe Wilson and the Korean Interdiction and Modernization of Sanctions Act introduced by Representative Ed Royce. These legislative activities clearly showed the interest and support that the US Congress accorded to Korean Peninsula issues.

Moreover, many US opinion leaders including scholars, journalists, think tank researchers, and former governmental officials visited Seoul. Leading figures from prestigious think tanks such as the Atlantic Council, Brookings Institution, Asia Society, Council on Foreign Relations, Heritage Foundation, and Korea Society travelled to Korea, as well as delegations from the press such as the Washington Times. As part of the efforts to build multi-layered cooperation networks with local governments, the Korean government welcomed the governors of Missouri, Wisconsin, and Tennessee and economic missions from the State of Maryland.

Moreover, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, through its State Government and Congress Invitation Program, invited local officials to Korea such as Chief of Staff to the Mayor of Boston and Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Fairfax County, Virginia. 

## 3 Managing The Regional Security Threat Based On The Strengthened Rok-Us Alliance

North Korea continued its nuclear and missile provocations in 2017, threatening the stability of the Korean Peninsula and the region. In response, the ROK and the US 
maintained the robust combined defense posture based on seamless collaboration in defending the security and stability of the Korean Peninsula.

President Moon, on his first overseas trip after his inauguration on May 10, visited the United States on June 28. As his first official schedule, he laid a wreath before the Battle of Chosin Reservoir memorial. On the morning of June 30, accompanied by US Vice President Mike Pence, he laid a wreath at the Korean War Memorial and met with representatives of Korean War veterans. This demonstrated the Moon administration's firm recognition of the ROK-US alliance as the foundation of the country's foreign and security policy and the will to further strengthen it. In a Joint Statement issued following the ROK-US Summit, the two leaders reaffirmed the ROK-US Alliance commitment to defend the ROK and agreed to hold on a regular basis the high-level Extended Deterrence Strategy and Consultation Group (EDSCG),

## Enhancing The Execution Ability Of The Extended Deterrence. Of Extended Deterrence.

North Korea launched ballistic missiles 15 times in 2017 alone and on September 3, 2017, conducted its sixth nuclear test. The next day, on September 4, President Moon and President Trump had a telephone communication and strongly condemned North Korea's provocation. As a practical countermeasure, the two leaders agreed in principle to lift the restrictions on the ROK's missile payload stipulated in the ROK-US missile guidelines. After a few subsequent working-level meetings, on the occasion of President Trump's visit to Seoul in November, the two leaders officially adopted the Revised Missile Guidelines 2017 and completely removed the restrictions on the ROK's missile payload in order to bolster the ROK's own defense capability as well as the ROK-US combined defense posture. Given that the nuclear and missile capabilities of North Korea were growing rapidly, this new agreement not only enhanced the ROK's national defense capacity but also displayed the deep trust and tight cooperation between the ROK and the US.

The US repeatedly sent out a strong message of the ironclad commitment to Regarding deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD)
system to the US Forces in Korea, which was decided earlier in 2016 in the spirit of the ROK-US alliance, the Moon administration conducted a small-scale environmental impact assessment on September 4, 2017. On September 7, the temporary deployment of remaining four launchers was completed, by which the system came to have operational capability. The ROK government also continued to communicate with neighboring countries, making it clear that the deployment of THAAD was not aimed at any third country and it would only be used in defense against North Korean nuclear or missile threats.

Trilateral defense cooperation among the ROK, US, and Japan in addressing the North Korean security threat continued in 2017. Starting with the two trilateral summits held on two occasions (on the occasion of the G20 Summit on July 6 and the United Nations General Assembly on Sept. 21), the three countries reaffirmed their will to jointly deal with the North Korean nuclear and missile threats through multiple high-level talks such as the Trilateral Foreign Ministers' Meeting, Trilateral Defense Ministers' Meeting, and Defense Trilateral Talks (DTT). In addition, there were efforts to enhance the three countries' capability to deal with the North Korean nuclear missile threat in practical ways such as missile warning exercises and video-teleconferences for information-sharing among defense authorities of the three countries. Of these, the first-ever anti-submarine warfare exercise is worthy of particular attention.

provide the ROK with the extended deterrence using the full spectrum of US military capability on various occasions of the holding of the two countries' high-level diplomatic security meetings - such as the ROK-US Summits (June 30, Sept. 21, and Nov. 7) and the ROK-US Foreign Ministers' Meetings (June 28, Aug. 6, and Sept. 21). The pledges have been reaffirmed on the occasion of multiple security conferences such as the 49th ROK-US Security Consultative Meeting (SCM) in October, and the 11th and 12th Korea-US Integrated Defense Dialogue (KIDD) held in April and October, respectively.

 In 2017, more practical steps were taken in addressing North Korea nuclear and missile threats. The two countries conducted ROK-US combined military exercises such as the Key Resolve (KR, Mar. 13-23), Foal Eagle (FE, Mar. 1-Apr. 30), and Ulchi-Freedom Guardian (UFG, Aug. 21-31), which are routine and defense-oriented.

It significantly contributed to strengthening the ROK-US combined defense posture.

And whenever major provocations by North Korea occurred, the US deployed to the Korean Peninsula its major strategic assets including USS Carl Vinson, a nuclearpowered aircraft carrier, and F-35B, a stealth fighter, to demonstrate its commitment As the 9th ROK-US Special Measures Agreement (SMA) on defense cost-sharing is to expire in 2018, the ROK government committed itself to preparing for the next round of consultations. The representative for the 10″ SMA consultations was appointed in November, and a pan-governmental Task Force including the Ministry of Defense was organized. Through the consultations with the US, the Task Force will endeavor to yield sound results which meet the expectations of the people of the ROK and the National Assembly while particularly taking into account two factors: contributions of the US Forces in Korea in defending the Korean Peninsula and

ensuring conditions for the stable stationing of US Forces in Korea.

Of particular note were outcomes of the 198th SOFA Joint Committee Meeting
(Nov. 21). On the said occasion, the Republic of Korea and the United States agreed to continue constructive consultations on environmental issues regarding USFK installations and to continue joint efforts in the prevention of crime related to USFK personnel. The two sides also discussed and took stock of the cooperative efforts to further ensure transparency in SOFA affairs for the Korean public, the completion of the repositioning of the Eighth Army Headquarters from Yongsan to Pyeongtaek, and the establishment of the Joint Working Group to address impacts on and harmonization of alliance military requirements and regional development of Saemangeum area in the vicinity of Kunsan Air Base.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) exerted great efforts in 2017 to further enhance transparency and fulfill the public's right-to-know in the area of Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA)-related affairs, especially through the first-ever disclosures of SOFA-related information. By mutual agreement, the governments of the Republic of Korea and the United States released data from the environmental survey regarding United States Forces Korea (USFK) military bases scheduled for return, namely Camp Market (Incheon Bupyeong) and Yongsan Garrison (Seoul). The two sides also publicly released information regarding real estate grant related to THAAD deployment. Additionally, the two sides agreed to release summaries of non-confidential information from SOFA implementing agreements to be signed from 2018 onwards.

In addition, as part of policy research aimed at improving the management of SOFA affairs, MOFA conducted field surveys in other US Armed Forces host nations such as Japan and Germany and held various meetings with relevant authorities. MOFA held Republic of Korea-Japan SOFA Directors' Meetings in Seoul (Mar. 29) and in Tokyo (Dec. 11), exchanging views on ways to improve management of SOFA affairs. MOFA also held meetings with SOFA-related German authorities in Berlin and Bonn, Germany (Dec. 6-7) and conducted a survey on Germany's legislation on and management of environmental issues of US Armed Forces installations in Germany.

Moreover, MOFA held SOFA-channel consultations at various levels throughout the year in order to achieve a smooth resolution of SOFA-related issues and to improve overall management of SOFA affairs. These included the SOFA Joint Committee Meeting (Nov. 21, Director General of North American Affairs Bureau, MOFA - Deputy Commander, USFK), separate meetings between the two Joint Committee Representatives (Jan. 11, Aug. 16, and Oct. 19), meetings between the Special Joint Committee Representatives (Mar. 31, Aug. 9, and Sept. 29) Deputy Director General of North American Affairs Bureau, MOFA - Assistant Chief of Staff, USFK J-5), as well as Subcommittee Meetings between the two sides. The Republic of Korea-side SOFA Subcommittee Chairpersons' Meeting aimed at strengthening inter-agency coordination was also held on November 9.

## � Korea-Japan Relations

Furthermore, the two sides reached an agreement on the restoration of "Shuttle Diplomacy" and strengthened dialogue by holding Korea-Japan summit talks on two occasions alongside the G20 Summit (Hamburg, July 7) and the 3ª Eastern Economic Forum (Vladivostok, Sept. 7), respectively.

Moreover, the two governments created positive momentum with regard to improving bilateral relations through multi-layered high-level dialogues and conversations including five foreign ministers' meetings (Feb. 7, Aug. 7, Sept. 7, Sept. 

22, and Dec. 19).

![29_image_0.png](29_image_0.png)

Through these active high-level exchanges and dialogues, Korea and Japan consistently strengthened close coordination for the settlement of issues concerning North Korea's provocations and nuclear programs and continued to enhance cooperation in practical areas such as economic, cultural, and people-to-people exchanges. After a series of provocations by North Korea with its sixth nuclear test on September 3 and missile tests, the Korean government strengthened cooperation and communication between Korea and Japan as well as among Korea, the US, and Japan.

Japan, as the closest neighboring country to Korea geographically and culturally, has also been a partner that Korea continues to cooperate with in working towards achieving peace and prosperity not only in the Northeast Asian region but across the world. In this regard, with the start of a new Korean government in 2017, the Moon Jae-in administration made many contributions towards the development of futureoriented relations between Korea and Japan in tandem with the settlement of

![29_image_1.png](29_image_1.png)

historical issues on the basis of firm principles.

Shortly after the start of the new Korean government, the two countries established communication channels at the highest level as well as mutual trust early on through telephone conversations between the leaders (May 11 and May 30) and exchanges with special envoys Korea-Japan Summit
(Korea, May 17-20 and Japan, June 10-13).

(Hamburg, July 7, 2017)
Furthermore, the defense ministries of Korea and Japan agreed to continuously share necessary information to counter North Korea's threats and extended the General Security of Military Information Agreement (GSOMIA), which was signed on November 23, 2016, for another year. Alongside the occasion of high-level exchanges, Korea and Japan held separate in-depth discussions on cooperation to tackle mutual issues of concern such as an aging society and the Fourth Industrial Revolution as well as policies to expand the scope of people-to-people exchanges including youth exchange programs with the 2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympic Games and the 2020 Tokyo Olympics to serve as momentum.

Meanwhile, the Korean government adopted a policy of standing firm on the basis of principles with regard to historical issues between the two countries. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs implemented strict measures which included summoning the Japanese ambassador and making official statements against Japan's provocative actions: a political leader's visit to the Yasukuni Shrine (a symbol of Japan's past

In particular, the task force on the "comfort women" issue was established on July 31, 2017, to review the December 2015 Agreement to resolve the issue of Japan's wartime comfort women, and it announced on December 27, 2017, that the agreement lacked a victim-centered approach. Strictly accepting the task force's position, the Korean government tried to come up with measures aimed at restoring dignity and healing emotional wounds of the victims by gathering their opinions as well as those of concerned groups while focusing on a victim-centered approach.

People-to-people exchanges between Korea and Japan remained relatively high in 2017. Korea and Japan were the third largest trading partners to each other in the field of economy and trade, with bilateral trade volume reaching approximately US$82 billion, a 14.1% increase compared to the previous year. People-to-people exchanges grew in comparison to the previous year on the basis of improved mutual perceptions between the two countries. The number of Korean visitors to Japan in 2017 recorded at 7.14 million, a 40% increase from the previous year, while Japanese visitors to Korea amounted to 2.31 million, ranking second highest among foreign countries.

Various initiatives were also carried out to enhance mutual understanding and promote cultural and people-to-people exchanges between Korea and Japan.

The Korea-Japan Festival, the largest annual grassroots cultural event which has been taking place at the capital cities of the two countries since 2009, was held on September 23-24.

Following the establishment of a new Korean government, on the occasion of their first telephone conversation (May 11) and first summit meeting at the G20 Summit (Berlin, July 6), President Moon Jae-in and President Xi Jinping discussed bilateral ties and the situation on the Korean Peninsula. At the summit, the two leaders were able to develop mutual trust and friendship. Meanwhile, a government delegation was sent to the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation (May 13-16) and Special Envoy of the President of the Republic of Korea, Lee Hae-chan, visited China (May 18-20). Both occasions provided opportunities to reaffirm the importance of ROK-China ties and the commitment to further enhance relations. 

Consequently, Chinese group travel to Korea partly resumed (Nov. 28) and various activities to strengthen relations once again were also restored, including cultural exchange events organized by local governments and private institutions, thereby promoting people-to-people exchange and cooperation between the two countries.

In this context, such high-level officials as Executive Vice-President of the Central Party School He Yiting (Nov. 21-23) and Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Leung Chun-ying (Nov.

bilateral meetings on the occasion of ASEAN-related Foreign Ministers' Meetings
(Manila, Aug. 6), and the UN General Assembly (New York, Sept. 20). During the meetings, the two sides held candid and in-depth discussions on issues of mutual concern, including major outstanding issues between Korea and China and the situation on the Korean Peninsula. A strategic dialogue between the vice foreign ministers also took place on June 20 in Beijing.

President Moon Jae-in made a state visit to China on December 14 to 16, which came at the 25th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations. During President Moon's state visit, both sides reaffirmed their commitment to restore and advance communication and cooperation in various fields and agreed to build ROK-China relations into a substantive and mature strategic cooperative partnership.

On October 31, Korea and China simultaneously announced the outcome of the consultations between the Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China on improving bilateral relations, after a series of close consultations through diplomatic channels. Both sides agreed that the difficulties in bilateral relations due to the THAAD issue was not in accordance with the mutual interests of the two countries.

 In 2017, the number of visitors between Korea and China reached approximately 4.17 million, a decrease in half compared to the previous year. The number of weekly commercial flights between the two countries also dropped to 399 from 1,170 in 2016. Nonetheless, President Moon's state visit to China served as momentum to restore people-to-people exchanges, as China partially resumed the sales of group tours to Korea following the visit.

## � Korea-Japan-China Trilateral Cooperation

The year 2017 was the year that enabled the three countries to secure its trilateral cooperation system following the 6" Trilateral Summit (2015) and subsequently the 8th Trilateral Foreign Ministers' Meeting (2016). Despite a string of pending bilateral issues that remained, the three countries consistently held trilateral consultative group meetings, including the trilateral Foreign Ministers' meeting. 

The three governments continued to work closely for mutual cooperation and hosted various trilateral meetings at the ministerial level: the 17th Trilateral Finance Ministers' and Central Bank Governors' Meeting (Yokohama, May 5), the 19th Tripartite Environment Ministers' Meeting (Suwon, Aug. 24-25), the 960 Trilateral Culture Ministers' Meeting (Kyoto, Aug. 25-26), the 9th Tripartite Governors' Meeting among PBC, BOJ, and BOK (Songdo, Sept. 13-14), and etc.

 In particular, the three countries implemented deliverables", including the 200 Trilateral High-Level Dialogue on the Arctic (Tokyo, June 8), the trilateral consultative meeting among police authorities (Tokyo, Nov. 14-16), Digital Single Market Joint Research, among others, all of which were based on proposals agreed upon by the three countries at the 6th Trilateral Summit.

As a result of a variety of diplomatic efforts among the three countries, not only was a consensus formed with regard to the early holding of the 7th Trilateral Summit, but momentum for trilateral cooperation also continued, which included holding the DDG Meeting (Tokyo, Dec. 26) so as to prepare for the Trilateral Summit. 

Furthermore, the three countries continued to promote the Trilateral Partnership Program for Government Officials of Korea, Japan and China (Seoul/Jeju, Apr. 16-20), Korea-Japan-China Trilateral Cooperation Workshop for Public Officials (Gonjiam, June 8-9), Trilateral Youth Camp (PyeongChang, July 18-21), UCC Contest on Trilateral Cooperation (Apr. 21-May 31), Trilateral Youth Summit (Changchun/Beijing, Sept.

1) Business projects to achieve performance
25-30), Thesis Competition on Korea-China-Japan Trilateral Cooperation (Seoul, Nov. 9), and the Day of Reunion (Seoul, Dec. 19), and to build networks among the younger generation since they are deemed the future of trilateral cooperation.

In addition, the Trilateral Cooperation Secretariat (TCS), marking its 60 anniversary this year since its establishment in September 2011, was active in implementing a wide variety of programs such as the International Forum for Trilateral Cooperation 
(Seoul, Apr. 18), Young Ambassador Program (Seoul, July 31-Aug. 11), Trilateral Journalist Exchange Program (Shenzhen/Tokyo/Seoul, June 14-23), and Network of Trilateral Cooperation Think-Tanks (Seoul, Oct. 13), among others, in order to further enhance trilateral cooperation.

## 4 Korea-Russia Relations

Korea and Russia consolidated their strategic partnership through continuous high-level consultations such as summit meetings, mutual visits by speakers of parliament, and foreign ministerial meetings along with economic cooperation in diverse areas. Leaders of Korea and Russia have had three summit meetings and two phone calls since the inauguration of President Moon, and they have contributed to strengthening the bond between the two leaders.

President Moon met with President Putin on the occasion of the G20 Summit in July and the Eastern Economic Forum in September. The two leaders reaffirmed their will to maintain a stable and firm bilateral relationship and agreed to increase the bilateral trade volume to US$30 billion and the number of people to people exchanges to one million by 2020 to celebrate the 30″ anniversary of diplomatic ties. They also had in-depth discussions about the current situation on the Korean Peninsula based on their shared understanding about the peace and prosperity of the Korean Peninsula. The two leaders agreed that North Korea's nuclear program is unacceptable and reaffirmed their firm commitment to working together closely for the denuclearization of North Korea.

The two leaders also shared the understanding that Korea's New Northern Policy and Russia's Greater Eurasian Partnership have a common goal and that they create a momentum for boosting economic cooperation despite the challenging international circumstances. They also noted that bilateral cooperation for Russia's Far East and Siberia development program would contribute to building a mutually beneficial bilateral relationship.

In June, Speaker of the Russian State Duma Byacheslav Volodin visited Korea, and Speaker of the Korean National Assembly Chung Sye-kyun visited Moscow in October. Park Won-soon, Mayor of Seoul, also visited Moscow in June followed by the visit of Mayor of Moscow Andrey Vorobiev to the GyeongGi Province.

The Foreign Ministers of both countries met in February on the occasion of the Munich Security Conference and discussed bilateral cooperation, the situation on the Korean Peninsula and in Northeast Asia, and North Korea's nuclear program. They also met in August after the inauguration of President Moon and agreed to strengthen the strategic cooperative partnership between the two countries, noting with satisfaction the increase in high-level exchanges and trade are positive signs that show development in the Korea-Russia relations.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov appreciated the Korean government's efforts to ease tension on the Korean Peninsula and expressed his will to cooperate with the Korean government in encouraging North Korea to join denuclearization dialogues.

Meanwhile, the two countries strived to strengthen economic cooperation by boosting the exchanges among intergovernmental consultative bodies and increasing cooperation on the development of Russia's Far East region. Throughout 2017, there were 15 inter-governmental committee meetings including the deputy prime minister level Joint Economic Committee Meeting in September and the vice minister level Far East Siberia Committee Meeting in June. Other joint committees such as the Agricultural Committee, the Fisheries Committee, and the Energy Committee also had meetings to seek ways to boost concrete cooperation between the two countries.

Furthermore, President Moon attended the 3td East Economic Forum, held in Vladivostok in September, and met with President Putin. The two leaders agreed that both countries are ideal partners for the development of the Russian Far East and presented the 9-Bridge Strategy (gas, railways, ports, power generation, arctic shipping routes, shipbuilding, agriculture, fisheries, and industrial complexes) as a vision for the New Northern Policy and for achieving co-prosperity in Eurasia. They also agreed to establish the Committee on Northern Economic Cooperation, to launch a Korea-Russia regional forum, to build a financing platform of US$20 billion for Russian Far East, to increase investment consulting by opening a Korea Business Center and holding Korean Investors' Day and to create a working group on the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) FTA.

In 2017, the trade volume between the two countries reached US$18.95 billion, posting an increase of 41.4% from the previous year. Korea is Russia's seventh largest export partner and eighth largest import partner.20 In addition, various exchanges in the private sector, particularly the Korea-Russia Dialogue37, have played a pivotal role in increasing understanding between the two countries. A variety of events such as expert seminars, journalist seminars, film festivals, dialogues between colleague students, and other events for political,

Furthermore, the Korean government is implementing various tailor-made public diplomacy programs in Russia on reinforcing Korean language education, introducing and promoting Korean culture, and supporting academic research on Koreans in Russia so as to build a firm foundation for the development of the Korea-Russia relations and enhance mutual understanding between the peoples of the two countries. As part of such efforts, the Korean Cultural Center in Moscow hosted the Week of Korean Culture in spring, the Korean Cultural Festival in autumn and carried out cultural programs involving literature exchanges, dance

and Mongolian press corp (Oct. 16-20) to deepen existing relations between the two countries.

Following mutual visits by the presidents of Korea and Mongolia in 2016, high-level exchanges between the two countries continued in 2017. On September 6, President Moon introduced the New Northern Policy and proposed to enhance bilateral cooperation in areas including energy, natural resources and transportation, as well as logistics during a summit meeting held on the occasion of the 3″ Eastern Economic Forum. President Khaltmaa Battulga stated his wish to promote economic cooperation by utilizing Mongolia's abundant natural resources and Korea's cuttingedge technology through an increase in manpower exchange.

Northeast Asia is a place where geostrategic tension and competition still exists between major countries such as the US, China, Japan, and Russia. As a middle power country, it is crucial for Korea to put an effort not only in building firm bilateral relationships, but also intensifying cooperative and peaceful relationships with various countries in the vast region.

Under such circumstances, the regional diplomacy of the Korean government, which focuses its efforts in Northeast Asia, does not limit its capability only to Northeast Asia and pushes forward with its national political agenda entitled "Northeast Asia+ Community of Responsibility" to foster an environment for prosperity and peace. In order to build a Pillar of Peace in the region, the Government of the Republic of Korea endeavored to promote the Northeast Asia Peace and Cooperation (NAPC) Platform - where the US, China, Japan, Russia, and Mongolia participate as key countries and the UN, EU, OSCE, ASEAN, and etc.

participate as dialogue partners - and develop the Korea-Japan-China Trilateral Cooperation system. In addition, the Korean government's New Southern Policy, which aims to strengthen cooperation with ASEAN and India, and New Northern Policy, which aims to increase connectivity within Eurasia, constitute the Pillar of Prosperity.

Furthermore, both presidents recognized the importance of strengthening bilateral cooperation between the two countries to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue and agreed to link the Korean government's Northeast Asia Platform for Peace and Cooperation with the Mongolian government's Ulanbataar Dialogue Initiative on Northeast Asian Security; thereby securing peace and stability in the Northeast Asian region.

In addition, Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha met with Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Batmunkh Battsetseg of Mongolia, who visited Korea in August to participate in the 8" FEALAC Foreign Ministers' Meeting. Foreign Deputy Minister Lim Sung-nam also held bilateral talks with State Secretary of Foreign Affairs Davaasurren Damdinsuren of Mongolia while attending the 13th ASEM Foreign Ministers' Meeting in November. The discussions strengthened communication among the senior officials of the two countries.

The NAPC Platform is a new version of the former Northeast Asia Peace and Cooperation Initiative (NAPCI). The NAPC Platform has succeeded the NAPCl's goal to lay the foundation for sustainable peace and prosperity in Northeast Asia by gradually building trust through cultivating a habit of dialogue and cooperation. Being well aware of the limitations of the former NAPCI which intended to start the Meanwhile, Korea and Mongolia continued working together to enhance peopleto-people exchanges between the public and private sector and carried out various exchange programs such as inviting Mongolian congressional aides (Sept. 11-15)
dialogue and cooperation via soft security but was limited due to the current state of tension and confrontation in the region, the NAPC Platform has searched for a new approach. By acknowledging the limitations of NAPCI's functional approach which assumed cooperation in non-traditional and soft security issues that are less politically sensitive would gradually lead to security cooperation between governments, the NAPC Platform handled regional security issues, non-traditional and soft security issues, and also broadened partnerships with other nations as well as international and regional organizations to assign mobility to multilateral cooperation.

Since July 2017, when President Moon proclaimed the NAPC Platform as one of the 100 policy tasks, the Korean government has relentlessly endeavored to improve the major countries' understanding of the initiative, garner empathy over the necessity of the initiative, and lead those countries into participation. As

250 people, consisting of prominent former government officials and academics, have participated in the very first Northeast Asia multilateral cooperation-focused 1.5 track forum including key countries such as the US, China, Japan, Russia, and Mongolia, and dialogue partners such as the UN, EU, OSCE,
and ASEAN. The intergovernmental discussion, which was held in parallel with the forum, was also joined by representatives of eight countries and four international organizations that have highly appreciated and welcomed our regional vision and agreed to further develop and regularize the multilateral consultation.

The government, in parallel with the 1.5 track forum, has also enlarged its scope of cooperation with the private sector and has continued to build a private-public network to nurture its private sector cooperation. After the inauguration, the government called for the building of a private-public network and supported domestic think tanks to facilitate cooperative projects with their foreign counterparts from China, Japan, Russia, and etc.

roots with ASEAN's own vision for a People-centered, People-oriented community. The ROK government has set specific targets of completing President's visit to all 10 ASEAN countries by 2019, increasing the number of people-to-people exchanges to 15 million people by 2020, and reaching two-way trade volume of US$200 billion by 2020, and is making government-wide efforts to achieve these goals. In order to build a people-centered community between ASEAN and ROK that

connects the hearts and minds of our peoples, the ROK government continued various efforts to expand exchanges among various groups including government, businesses, students, and so on. And as part of this endeavor, the ROK government opened, on September 1, 2017, the ASEAN Culture House, the first of its kind to open outside of ASEAN in one of the dialogue partners. The ASEAN Culture House, as a platform for human and cultural exchange is expected to become a hub for two-way exchanges between ASEAN and ROK.

Also, moving beyond rhetoric to achieve a greater level of cooperation with ASEAN, the ROK government has further reinforced the institutional and financial basis of the New Southern Policy. First, the ROK government established a new organization dedicated to promoting, developing, and implementing projects under the New Southern Policy. Second, the government continued to make efforts to increase funds devoted to ASEAN, including the ASEAN-ROK Cooperation Fund, and the Mekong-ROK Cooperation Fund. Finally, in 2019, on the occasion of the 30" anniversary of the establishment of dialogue partnership, the ROK government will host the ASEAN-ROK Commemorative Summit. The Commemorative Summit will be an occasion to gain momentum and harness the political will of the leaders to further strengthen ASEAN-ROK cooperation as well as to bring about an ASEAN
boom in Korea.

 President Moon Jae-in announced the New Southern Policy during his tour of Southeast Asia on November 2017 as part of his initiative to diversify and expand the Republic of Korea's diplomatic relations and economic outreach. In this connection, President Moon expounded his vision for a future community of ASEAN and ROK at the annual ASEAN-ROK Summit held in Manila, Philippines on November 13, 2017. The ROK government aims to take ASEAN-ROK relations beyond the current Strategic Partnership to a Co-prosperous, People-centered, Peace Community through the above initiative of a future community together. This initiative, which is centered on the 3Ps - people, prosperity, and peace - shares its philosophical

# Bilateral Economic Diplomacy

## Economic Relations With Major Trading Partners

Although Korea's external economic environment in 2017 generally improved due to the economic recovery of both developed and developing countries, uncertainty still remained over the rise in global trade protectionism and the monetary policy changes of major countries. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) made efforts to strengthen bilateral economic relations with major trading partners including the US, China, the EU, Japan, ASEAN and India so that foreign trade could contribute to revitalizing Korea's economic growth.

First, the Korea-US Senior Economic Dialogue (SED) was held on January 9, 2017. At the dialogue, Korea and the US reviewed their current bilateral economic relationship and discussed potential means for further cooperation in areas such as development cooperation, space, climate change, energy security, ocean, and Arctic activities. The two sides also exchanged views on regional and global economic issues. In addition, based on the vision agreed upon at the Korea-US summit meeting in June 2017, Korea and the US held the 135 ROK-US Joint Public-Private Economic Forum on October 23, 2017. On that occasion, the two sides discussed ways to strengthen bilateral cooperation regarding women's economic empowerment and the Fourth Industrial Revolution.

There had been a slump in Korea-China economic relations for some time due to strained bilateral relations. However, through President Moon's state visit on December 13-16, Korea and China agreed to deepen economic cooperation and exchanged views on a series of economic issues such as linking Korea's New Northern Policy and New Southern Policy with China's Belt and Road Initiative, enhancing financial

![72_image_0.png](72_image_0.png) cooperation, revitalizing trade and investment, reducing non-tariff barriers, etc.

Furthermore, MOFA strengthened economic cooperation with Chinese regional governments alongside China's recent policy modifications, which include the expansion of domestic demand and balancing regional development. In particular, since President Moon's state visit in December 2017, MOFA co-hosted forums on Northeast Asia Regional Cooperation with three northeastern provinces" (Shenyang, Dec. 21) and a Korea-China Economic Innovation Policy Forum (Guangzhou, Dec. 26) with Guangdong Province.

The 14th Korea-EU Joint Committee Meeting was held on December 15, 2017. At the meeting, Korea and the EU exchanged views on bilateral relations and reviewed existing bilateral dialogues based on the Korea-EU Framework Agreement and the Korea-EU FTA. The two sides also agreed to strengthen bilateral cooperation in the areas of free trade, climate change, development cooperation, and human rights, and, in particular, to enhance collaboration in multilateral economic fora such as the G20 and WTO against trade protectionism. In addition, Korea and the EU aimed to increase cooperation in the following sectors: employment, social issues, personal data protection, and science technology.

Moreover, Korea and Germany held the 30" Korea-Germany Joint Economic Committee on January 10, 2017. The two sides discussed ways to enhance bilateral

1) Heilongjiang Province, Jilin Province, and Liaoning Province
relations on trade and investment, and to strengthen mutual cooperation in the areas of manufacturing, SMEs, job training, renewable energy, and ICT. 

With regard to Japan, the ROK-Japan High-Level Economic Consultation originally scheduled to take place in January 2017 was unilaterally postponed by the Japanese side as a countermeasure against the installation of a comfort women statue in front of the Japanese Consulate in Busan. Nonetheless, the two sides resumed talks on bilateral economic cooperation and affirmed the necessity for future-oriented cooperation on the occasions of various high-level exchanges including the bilateral summit meetings which took place on the sidelines of the G20 Summit (July 7), the Eastern Economic Forum (Sept. 7), and the Korean Foreign Minister's visit to Japan
(Dec. 19-20). The bilateral economic cooperation issues that were discussed included Korean youth employment in Japan, a joint response with regard to the Fourth Industrial Revolution, and the expansion of people-to-people exchanges. 

 Furthermore, in terms of a New Southern Policy dimension, MOFA strengthened economic diplomacy with ASEAN and India. In 2017, the 16th Meeting of the ROK-Vietnam Joint Economic Committee was held (Oct. 24) in line with the 25th anniversary of diplomatic relations with Vietnam, which has been one of the most active trading partners among the ASEAN countries. Through the meeting, both sides assessed existing achievements in bilateral trade, investment, infrastructure, finance, and development, and discussed ways to promote future cooperation. Moreover, President Moon visited three ASEAN countries (Nov. 8-15) and held summit meetings with Joko Widodo, President of Indonesia, Tran Dai Quang, President of Vietnam, and Rodrigo Duterte, President of the Philippines, and established a framework to develop prosperous win-win relations by strengthening cooperation in various fields such as expanding trade and investment as well as development cooperation.

 Korea proceeded with three rounds of negotiations to improve the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) with India (200 round in New Delhi, Feb.

12-16; 300 round in Seoul, Sept. 21-22; 40 round in New Delhi, Dec. 20-21) with regard to further increasing the level of liberalization in goods and services, and easing the criteria for rules of origin. In June, Korea and India signed the Economic Development Cooperation Fund Framework Agreement and the MOU for export credit to financially support various infrastructure development projects in India. High-level bilateral exchanges including a visit by MOFA's First Vice Minister to New Delhi in March and a bilateral summit meeting held in Hamburg during the G20 Summit in July, provided good opportunities to review and discuss major economic issues as well as various measures to enhance further cooperation between the two countries.

## 2 Resolving Trade Remedy Issues

In 2017, the number of new investigations initiated against products originating from Korea decreased in comparison to the previous year (from 42 to 26); however, the total number of trade remedies against Korean products rose from 2012. At the end of 2017, 189 trade remedy measures, including those in the process of investigation (148 anti-dumping measures, eight countervailing duties, and 33 safeguard measures)
were enforced against Korea, a 3% increase compared to the previous year (184).

As a result of the activities by the Trade Remedy Reaction Team (led by the Deputy Director General of the Bilateral Economic Affairs Bureau) such as dispatching the Trade Remedy Reaction Team to various countries, sending government letters, and conveying opinions at high-level meetings, MOFA derived positive outcomes as follows: the EU's termination of an anti-dumping investigation on purified terephthalic acid (PTA) imported from Korea, the Indian government's termination of an anti-dumping investigation on polybutadiene rubber (PBR), the Vietnamese government's negative determination and lowering of tariffs concerning pre-galvanized steel sheets and strips, the Chinese government's favorable decision concerning safeguard measures on sugar as well as the termination of anti-dumping measures on ECH, the Pakistan government's termination of an anti-dumping investigation and a refund of provisional tariffs concerning offset ink, the Indian government's determination to minimize the burden of duties concerning hot-rolled

## 3) Support For Addressing Issues In Overseas Business Activities

MOFA supported Korean companies that faced difficulties in conducting business overseas by providing legal consultation services, implementing business support projects through missions, and publishing various casebooks.

First, the Korean diplomatic missions carried out a number of projects that supported companies in addressing issues related to customs clearance, licensing, and collecting past-due accounts. They also closely consulted and communicated with companies by holding local consultative group meetings.

Furthermore, legal consultation services were provided to Korean SMEs through Korean diplomatic missions to resolve legal difficulties they may have experienced in areas of overseas business such as labor law, environmental law, tax systems and customs clearance.

MOFA also organized Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) activities of its diplomatic missions, supporting and encouraging Korean companies to carry out their own CSR programs particularly in China and Southeast Asia where Korean companies were actively expanding their businesses.

Furthermore, overseas missions provided cyber business consultation services to Korean companies when inquiries were made on the missions' websites.

As part of the efforts to overcome the high unemployment rate of Korea's young population, MOFA strived to develop various assistance plans to expand overseas employment, and intensified its efforts to address both pre-and post-employment issues.

By holding bi-monthly task force meetings chaired by the Second Vice Minister, MOFA monitored the progress and future plans of its various projects that supported overseas job creation. It also established consultative bodies at 17 diplomatic missions to expand overseas employment by providing information on local labor-related rules and regulations, holding job fairs, resolving bottleneck problems in employment issues, etc.

Africa's Green Growth Potential," in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, in October 2017 while during the same week, MOFA hosted a seminar on African Countries' Nationally Determined Contributions Implementation and Cooperation with Korea to seek ways for Korea to contribute to Africa's implementation of the Paris Agreement.

The Green Climate Fund (GCF) has assumed a core role in implementing the Paris Agreement and in formulating resources for long-term climate finance. The 16" (Apr.

4-6) and the 17th (July 5-6) GCF Board Meetings took place in Songdo, Incheon. The 18th (Sept. 30-Oct. 2) GCF Board Meeting took place in Cairo, Egypt.

During the 16" Board Meeting, the Korea Development Bank (KDB) concluded an Accreditation Master Agreement with the GCF, helping Korean companies actively participate in climate change projects. During the 17th Board Meeting, the GCF
discussed means to include more "Accredited Entities" as well as ways to enlarge the Secretariat. These "Accredited Entities," including the KDB, with the financial support of the GCF, will develop and deliver climate change projects in developing countries. During the 18th Board Meeting, the GCF approved 11 additional projects - out of the total US$1.64 billion, the GCF decided to fund US$390 million - that aims to support developing countries in adapting to climate change. Thus, as of December 2017, the GCF had approved 54 projects so far. These projects are worth US$8.97 billion in total, and among the entire amount, the GCF decided to fund these projects partly, which amounts to US$2.63 billion. The Board of the GCF also decided to revisit the current status of the GCF Secretariat, resulting in the establishment of a Deputy Executive Director position and the External Affairs Division.

At the 2ªª Green Round Table held on March 15, 2017, climate resource mechanisms and their operation trends were introduced to the domestic audience as well as overseas opportunities utilizing climate finance. In celebration of the GGGI's 5th anniversary as an international organization, the 3th Green Round Table held on December 1, 2017, served as an opportunity to review the progress that the GGGI had made thus far and discuss ways for the GGGI and Korean small and medium-sized enterprises in the environment sector to collaborate in successful overseas business opportunities. The Korean government has also been strengthening cooperation with Denmark, a major green growth partner. Since Korea and Denmark established the Green Growth Alliance - the first value alliance of its kind - in 2011, they have held the Korea-Denmark Green Growth Alliance meeting annually. In November 2017, the Minister of Environment of the Republic of Korea, participated in the seventh annual alliance meeting and discussed themes such as the "Implementation of a Circular Economy and SDGs" and "Roles of the Government and Business in the Transition Toward a Circular Economy."
Meanwhile, Partnering for Green Growth and the Global Goals 2030 (P4G) was launched at the 72™ Session of the United Nations General Assembly in September 2017, where Kang Kyung-wha, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Korea expressed Korea's participation in P4G to contribute to implementing green growth and the SDGs and hoped synergies would be created through cooperation with the GGGI and the Green Climate Fund. Also, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Korea - in cooperation with the Ministry of Environment, relevant agencies, and the business community - dispatched environment business delegations to new, promising markets and regions that are difficult for private entities to access.

MOFA launched the Green Round Table in November 2016 to discuss ways to strengthen cooperation and synergies among international organizations and domestic agencies related to green economy concerns. In 2017, two rounds of the round table were held.

Change on February 9, 2017, the two countries discussed the way forward in making progress in the current climate change negotiations. At the 200 Meeting of the ROK-China Joint Committee for Cooperation on Climate Change on July 25, 2017, the two countries shared their views on the major agenda items of the climate change negotiations and discussed how to strengthen cooperation on various issues such as fine dust reduction.

At the 22ºd Session of the Conference of the Parties (COP22), held in Marrakech, Morocco in November 2016, the international community agreed to finalize the rulebook of the Paris Agreement by 2018.

At the 23td Session of the Conference of the Parties (COP23), held in Bonn, Germany on November 6-17, 2017, the international community reaffirmed the irrevocability of the Paris Agreement and adopted an informal note to establish the guidelines for the implementation of each of the main agenda items. As a result, the basis for the implementation of the Paris Agreement was laid down in COP23, and the Korean delegation actively participated in the negotiations to establish the implementation guidelines for each agenda item.

Through bilateral Joint Committees on Environmental Cooperation with Japan, and with Russia, Korea has reviewed its environmental policies along with cooperation projects in a wide range of areas such as regional environmental cooperation in Northeast Asia, air and marine pollution, climate change response, measures on marine debris, biodiversity, and marine conservation.

At a high-level informal dialogue on climate change entitled "Mobilizing World Leaders Toward Transformation" and hosted by the United Nations Secretary-
General Antonio Guterres on September 19, 2017 during the 72nd Session of the UN General Assembly, the Government of the Republic of Korea introduced its environment-friendly climate policies and expressed its commitment to cooperate in climate change response. Moreover, the government actively participated in climate change-related international conferences such as the One Planet Summit; held in France on December 12, 2017; created momentum for the implementation of the Paris Agreement; and enhanced ambition for climate change response.

## 2) Strengthening International Cooperation For Environmental Protection

Global environmental issues cover a wide range of areas including air, ecosystems, the ocean, and hazardous waste and chemical substances. More than 160 international conventions are in effect with the support of the UN and OECD.

Korea has acceded to a number of leading international conventions on the protection of the environment and has taken part in the discussion of, and response to, such global environmental issues as the protection of biodiversity, sustainable use of resources, protection of marine ecosystems, and international management of chemical and toxic substances through these conventions. In 2017, the Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilization were ratified by the National Assembly and came into force on August 17.

The Republic of Korea actively participated in the discussion on global cooperation for environmental protection and conservation such as the Conference of the Parties to the Basel, Rotterdam, and Stockholm Conventions (Geneva, Apr.), the UN High Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development Goals (New York, July), and the Asia-Pacific Ministerial Summit on the Environment jointly hosted by UNESCAP and the UNEP (Bangkok, Sept.). In particular, Korea attended the 3d United Nations Environment Assembly (Nairobi, Dec.), which was held to pave the way "Towards a Pollution-Free Planet" and shared our continuous efforts to address environmental challenges while stressing the need for international cooperation to tackle transboundary air pollution.

## 5 Strengthening International Cooperation On The Arctic

After joining the Arctic Council as an observer state in May 2013, the Korean government adopted the Arctic Policy Master Plan (2013-2017) in December 2013 and continued to strengthen cooperation with Arctic Council member states. Korea participated in the Senior Arctic Officials Meeting on two occasions in 2017, and Korean experts on the Arctic attended six working group meetings and other task forces under the Arctic Council. Korea also participated in the 2ªº Trilateral High-Level Dialogue and took the initiative to formulate a vision for Korea, Japan, and China to cooperate on Arctic issues. In addition, Korea held bilateral consultations with Arctic member states including Finland (Chair of the Arctic Council), Canada, and Norway.

Korea also held the first bilateral consultation with Russia, a key partner country of Korea's New Northern Policy, and laid the foundation for the development of northern economic cooperation regarding the Arctic sea routes and natural gas.

To lay the foundation for a new economic diplomacy, the Korean government supported the joining of the Korea Shipowners' Association into the Arctic Economic Council (AEC), a first for a Korean association, and held a Korea-AEC Seminar on December 11, 2017 in Seoul. Furthermore, a seminar on international law regarding the Arctic was held on July 20, 2017 in Seoul, and the 2017 Arctic Partnership Week took place on December 12-15, 2017 in Busan in order to enhance domestic and international understanding on Arctic cooperation. The Korean government held a youth meeting for two consecutive years and invited students from the Arctic region to exchange opinions during the 2017 Arctic Partnership Week.

 In addition, a Korean delegation took part in the negotiations on the Central Arctic Ocean Fisheries Agreement on November 28-30, 2017 in Washington, DC and actively engaged in discussions on international regulations to establish an order in the Arctic Ocean.

period of 2013 and 2016. Based on the results of the assessments, assistance strategy to provide additional US$120 million to Afghanistan for the years 2017 through 2020 has been established.

The Korean government conducted the Korea Disaster Relief Team's (KDRT) 2017 joint domestic mock exercise in June 2017 in order to review a range of systems for emergency relief including the decision-making process, the preparedness for mobilization of KDRT personnel, logistics, military air craft operation, and the cooperation system among the organizations concerned. The exercise was the first one to which international standard procedures for the dispatch of emergency relief personnel were applied, since the KDRT's rescue team (search and rescue unit) gained the highest grade ("Heavy") and was officially recognized by the UN's International Search and Rescue Advisory Group (INSARAG) in its classification test in 2016. 

In order to enhance public awareness on development cooperation and accelerate the private sector's engagement in the policy building process, the Korean government has been strengthening its partnership with the civil society, businesses, and the academia.

Also, through the volunteer program, MOFA provided ODA project field experience and career development opportunities to 6,093 people interested in development cooperation.

Since the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) had only a limited impact on fragile states in extreme poverty, the international community views conflict and fragility as essential for the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals
(SDGs). Against this backdrop, the Korean government newly established the Assistance Strategy for Fragile States and joined the Food Assistance Convention to meet the rising demand for humanitarian assistance of the international community.

In 2017, the Korean government conducted comprehensive assessments of its previous assistance for the socio-economic development of Afghanistan over the Chapter 4

It also holds online quiz events so that the public can gain a deeper

![114_image_0.png](114_image_0.png) understanding of foreign policies.

Since MOFA launched Live MOFA, a social broadcasting system, in September 2012, a total of 90 episodes have been broadcasted on Live MOFA up to December 2017. Live MOFA deals with important and interesting issues regarding foreign affairs and contributes to fostering interactive communication between MOFA and the public. In 2017, 22 episodes were broadcasted on Live MOFA, attracting an average of 18,560 viewers per episode.

MOFA provides our policy customers (the general public and professionals in the academia, the press, and public arenas), via e-mail, with recent news on MOFA's various activities on foreign affairs, such as the results of important international meetings and presidential trips overseas. In 2017, MOFA sent 60 of such newsletters and policy e-mails.

Participatory Diplomacy was included as one of the Moon Jae-in administration's 100 Policy Tasks in 2017. Participatory Diplomacy seeks to gather the opinions of the people on foreign policy issues and increase their participation. By doing so, MOFA can broaden the understanding and support of the people and mobilize their diplomatic capability to promote national interest. To this end, MOFA made various efforts to foster Participatory Diplomacy capacity by establishing relevant offices and regulations, while strengthening public communication with the Korean people in several ways.

Especially, it actively utilized social media for interactive communication with the public online, while increasing direct contact with the public through various public outreach programs, such as the Visit MOFA and Visit Schools programs. In addition, MOFA selected a topic regarding important diplomatic issues closely related to people's lives and conducted diverse public relations campaigns in order to transmit the information effectively to the people.

MOFA provides current news on its Korean and English language websites of the headquarters and 179 Korean language and 197 foreign language websites of its diplomatic missions overseas. In 2017, MOFA renovated its Korean language website to make it more user-friendly by re-organizing it into a 3-frame-based website.

In 2017, a total of 975 students and adults participated in the program.

Also, MOFA runs the Visit Schools program, where Korean diplomats visit middle and high schools and speak about foreign policy to the students. In 2017, 223 schools and about 23,000 students took part in the program. This includes students who go to schools located far away from Seoul and have less chance to visit MOFA. This program enables the students to enjoy the opportunity to meet diplomats and learn from their experiences as diplomats without having to visit MOFA. 

MOFA has assisted various activities of Friends of MOFA, a group of college student supporters. In 2017, Friends of MOFA, with their bright ideas and enthusiasm, promoted the activities of the Ministry and foreign policy initiatives by posting articles, photos, and videos on the Ministry's official blog. They also engaged in monitoring overseas missions' websites. In addition, MOFA hosts talk concerts under the title of Diplomacy Talk!

Following the conference, 95 media reports were released in 40 countries.

## � Focused Public Relations Campaigns

Since 2011, MOFA has conducted public relations campaigns on two or three diplomatic topics closely related to people's lives. Having promoted the Korean Emergency Response Team activities soon after the 2011 earthquake in Japan, MOFA
has focused on such topics as "the Global Poverty Eradication Contribution system,"
"Youth Programs Abroad," and "Public Diplomacy" in order to raise the public's understanding about MOFA's activities and thereby to enhance its image.

## � Establishing Infrastructure For Participatory Diplomacy - Strengthening Measures To Protect Overseas Korean

![117_Image_0.Png](117_Image_0.Png)

![117_Image_1.Png](117_Image_1.Png) Nationals

Chapter 3 MOFA has started to build infrastructure for Participatory Diplomacy in order to encourage interactive communication and participation among people regarding foreign policy. In July 2017, a task force was set up to develop the concept and strategy, conduct research on ways to build a platform for Participatory Diplomacy, and conduct case studies in other countries.

 MOFA also decided to set up the Center for Participatory Diplomacy, a focal point for implementing Participatory Diplomacy. Furthermore, MOFA delivered a series of briefings for different stakeholders, including the National Assembly, the academia, and relevant ministries in 2017. At the briefings, MOFA explained its efforts and activities to pursue Participatory Diplomacy in order to gain the consensus and support needed to establish the foundation for the new policy.

With the number of overseas travelers reaching 26 million in 2017, Korean nationals have been engaged in overseas activities more than ever before. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) devised a number of measures to prevent accidents involving overseas Koreans and promptly responded to emergencies. In particular, MOFA strived to promote its system to prevent overseas incidents via various media outlets including television, radio, websites, Facebook, blogs, and mobile applications in 2017. MOFA also maintained close cooperation with relevant authorities including the Office of the President, the National Intelligence Service, the National Police Agency, and the Ministry of Justice in taking preventive and responsive measures to protect overseas Korean nationals.

Protecting Overseas Korean Nationals and Promoting their Rights

## 1) Preventing Overseas Accidents (1) Safe Travel Campaign (3) Travel Prohibition System (2) Travel Advisory System (4) Safe Travel Volunteers

of the Travel Advisory System is to promote awareness among travelers on safety by providing appropriate and up-to-date advice on the risk factors of each travel destination.

The key to preventing overseas incidents among Korean travelers is to raise their awareness on safety so that they do not expose themselves to precarious situations. The most effective way to do so is to provide travelers with essential information for safe travel.

MOFA has been analyzing situations with potential threats of regional situation terrorism, security, and possible diseases around the world to update the Travel Advisory System twice a year. MOFA has continued to improve the Travel Advisory System by reflecting suggestions from travelers, travel agencies, airlines, and other potential beneficiaries.

To that end, MOFA implemented numerous measures utilizing various media outlets. First, MOFA launched a travel safety website (www.0404.go.kr) as well as a Facebook account to provide travel advice and safety information for each country in a timely manner and introduced safety measures to prevent the most common types of accidents including terrorism.

The Passport Act (revised in 2007) states that, when deemed necessary, MOFA may suspend any visit to or sojourn in any specific overseas country or region in order to protect the lives, physical safety and property of people against dangerous circumstances in locations overseas, such as natural disasters, wars, internal disturbances, revolts, and terror. By December 2017, travel to six countries (Somalia, Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, Yemen, and Libya) and some regions in the Philippines - including Zamboanga, Sulu Archipelago, Basilan, and Tawi-Tawi - was prohibited.

Therefore, a Korean national must obtain special permission if he or she wishes to visit or stay in such countries and regions. Those who visit countries or regions under the travel prohibition without obtaining special permission may be subject to prosecution.

 In addition, through television and radio programs such as YTN's Safe Travel Information, YTN's scroll news, and KBS's World Radio, MOFA reached out to a larger pool of potential travelers. MOFA also utilized its Facebook page to offer the latest safety information. Moreover, it developed a safe travel mobile application that makes it easier for travelers to access guidelines on safety and accident response.

Finally, MOFA conducted safe travel campaigns at airports during the peak season for tourism and distributed travel safety brochures at local passport-issuing agencies, travel agencies, and universities. In addition, MOFA sought to achieve two-way communication with the public by holding safety meetings and lectures on safe travel.

MOFA adopted the Travel Advisory System in 2004 to categorize countries and regions according to their level of risk. The Travel Advisory System has played a key role in preventing overseas incidents by providing people with safety information and the level of risk of the countries they are visiting.

Launched in July 2010 and expanded in 2011, the Safe Travel Volunteer Program has greatly contributed to promoting safety awareness among Koreans. Considering that younger travelers tend to travel alone or in small groups and pay less attention to safety issues, MOFA recruited volunteers among university students as a means to effectively deliver safety information to their peer groups.

This system divides countries according to the level of risk and issues alerts:
Blue indicates that travelers should "exercise precaution"; Yellow, "exercise high caution"; Red, "withdrawal recommended"; and Black, "travel prohibited." The goal In 2017, MOFA recruited 180 volunteers for the 14th Safe Travel Volunteer Program in July and the 15th Safe Travel Volunteer Program in December, respectively. The

volunteers participated in a Safe Travel Talk Concert and safe travel campaigns at airports and conducted online campaigns via blogs, Facebook, newspapers, and television. First launched in 2010, the Safe Travel Volunteers have made a significant contribution to enhancing people's awareness of safety and have become a valuable asset in protecting overseas Koreans with their creative ideas and active engagement.

In 2017, MOFA swiftly dispatched a Rapid Deployment Team to deal with a number of large-scale incidents including safety checks for the regional finals of the 2018 FIFA World Cup between Korea and China in March; the eruption of Bali's Mount Agung in November; a kindergarten school bus accident in Weihai, China in May; and to ensure the safety of Korean nationals.

In order to maintain a robust response posture and ensure a swift response to accidents, MOFA increased the number of joint simulation training sessions between the Rapid Deployment Team and overseas Korean societies to four separate training sessions in Cambodia (Sept. 2017), the Philippines and Russia (Nov. 2017), and Japan 
(Dec. 2017).

The Consular Call Center provides 24-hour counseling services on overseas and consular inquirie regarding passports and apostilles. It also provides services such as rapid overseas remittance, interpretation, a travel safety text messaging services, and travel safety tips.

MOFA has been working to strengthen protection measures for Koreans in the Philippines since approximately 32% of Korean nationals who were killed overseas over the last three years were killed in the Philippines. 

With the growing need for consular assistance, the average number of incoming calls per year reached 240,000 between 2014 and 2017, which is five times more than the first year that the Call Center opened. The Call Center responded to major consular cases, such as the Jiuzhaigou earthquake in the Sichuan area of China in August 2017, the Barcelona attacks in Spain in August 2017, and the Las Vegas shooting in the United States in October 2017, constantly monitoring the status and informing family members of those concerned until the safety of each and every person was confirmed.

With the dispatch of six police officers, MOFA increased the number of Korean help desks within police stations in the Philippines to help solve cold cases concerning Korean victims. Whenever a murder case involving a Korean national took place, MOFA cooperated with the Philippine National Police by sending professional profilers to help analyze the case. Furthermore, the Korean Embassy supported the Korean community in placing CCTVs where many Koreans reside, to strengthen the Korean community's capability for self-protection and crime prevention. Moreover, MOFA held several meetings in various regions in the Philippines with the Korean community to raise their awareness of safety. 

In recognition of these efforts, the Center has been selected as the Best Call Center among the call centers of the Korean central government by the Korea Management Association for 12 consecutive years since its opening in 2006.

In 2017, 35 staff members dispatched by MOFA actively worked to strengthen response capabilities in the event of an accident or incident involving Korean nationals. MOFA secured a budget for an additional 20 members to be hired as assistant staff members for consular officers considering the increasing demand for In order to respond quickly and effectively to overseas crises, MOFA has dispatched a Rapid Deployment Team, comprised of specialists from the MOFA headquarters in Seoul and/or from Korea's overseas missions located close to the crisis site.

MOFA has held regional conferences for Korean consular officers annually so that they are better equipped with the knowledge and capabilities necessary to address emergency situations. The conferences also have served as a venue to share information and best consular practices among overseas missions and to promote understanding among the consular officers of MOFA's policies and systems for overseas Korean protection. In 2017, MOFA held a total of six rounds of consular conferences: the Middle East and Japan in March, Europe, Africa, and the Southwest Asia-Pacific region in June, China and Mongolia in July, India in September, and Russia and the CIS region in November.

Emergency Financial Assistance is monetary aid provided to overseas missions and Korean nationals in a crisis situation. In November 2017, Emergency Financial Assistance was used to rent a chartered plane in Bali, Indonesia to remove Korean nationals from the area of the volcanic eruption of Mount Agung.

The number of Korean nationals traveling abroad has increased every year from 19 million in 2015, to 22 million in 2016, and to 26.5 million in 2017. Accordingly, the number of Korean nationals involved in various consular cases also increased to 18,410 in 2017, which consisted of 12,529 persons as victims of crimes, 1,692 persons facing criminal charges, and 4,189 in other categories. In addition to these general consular cases, the number of Korean nationals who have been affected by consular crises such as terrorism, and natural disasters has been on the rise.

Since March 2007, MOFA has been using a consular assistant who is always available to take spontaneous action in remote areas that do not have a Korean consular office. When an accident takes place, the appointed consular assistant can take action as an initial response. This system has expanded every year, with currently approximately 150 consular assistants, and has contributed to a more expedited initial response to accidents occurring around the world.

The Rapid Overseas Remittance System has assisted Korean travelers in urgent need of cash due to theft, loss, or other unforeseen circumstances. When a traveler faces such economic difficulties, family members or acquaintances of the traveler in Korea can transfer funds of up to US$3,000 to the Consular Call Center's domestic bank account. The Consular Call Center then notifies the relevant overseas mission to provide the same amount of money immediately to the applicant. In 2017, the system was used 1,055 times, and the amount of funds transferred totalled ₩70 million. MOFA's Rapid Overseas Remittance System is provided in cooperation with In October 2017, a gunman opened fire on a crowd at the Mandalay Bay Hotel, leaving 59 people dead and 527 injured. The MOFA headquarters immediately set up a Task Force on Overseas Koreans Protection (Director: Ambassador for Overseas Koreans and Consular Affairs). The MOFA headquarters TF actively ensured the safety of Korean nationals by establishing a communication line at all times with the Korean Consulate General in Los Angeles and the Consular Call Center, and by

partnership with relevant government agencies by taking part in various meetings such as the Meeting on Overseas Voting, convened by the National Election Commission (the NEC), and the Ministerial Meeting for a Fair Election.

The Korean Consulate General in Los Angeles also set up a local Task Force
(Director: Consul General in Los Angeles) and dispatched the Consul General and consular officer to the family support center, Medical Examiner's Office, and hospitals. Furthermore, in cooperation with Korean community associations, consular assistance, and travel agencies, the local TF ensured the safety of every Korean national in its jurisdiction.

The Korean government amended the Public Official Election Act in order to enable overseas Koreans to fully exercise their right to vote. The amendment allowed for an increase in the number of Overseas Election Commissions and deleted one of the addenda of the Act that could have prevented overseas Koreans from exercising their right to vote in an unforeseen election to fill a presidential vacancy. 

The Korean government dispatched 22 officials from the NEC to overseas missions to help prepare for the election abroad. It also established and operated the largestever number of Overseas Election Commissions, at 175 diplomatic and consular missions in 116 countries. The 19th presidential election witnessed an increase in voter turnout (221,981 voters out of 294,633 registrants) in comparison to the 1800 presidential election (158,225 voters out of 222,389 registrants), owing to an all-out campaign to reach out to overseas voters.

In November 2017, Mount Agung in Bali, Indonesia, began to spew hot volcanic ash into the air. As the Indonesian government shut down Bali's international airport, several airlines decided to stop operating flights. To help Korean nationals who were grounded at the airport, MOFA dispatched a Rapid Deployment Team to offer services including information on safe departure.

In addition, MOFA rented a bus and airplane to support the return of 266 Korean nationals to Korea.

Following the election, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, together with the NEC,
conducted an ex post facto evaluation of the process of overseas voting for future reference. The 18th Committee on Overseas Koreans Policy was held on December 22, 2017. The meeting was convened to discuss the policy direction of the newly launched administration with regard to promoting the rights and interests of overseas Koreans. Committee members particularly sought ways to enhance support and assistance for overseas Koreans currently living in Korea as well as Korean adoptees residing overseas, both of which had been relatively overlooked in previous policies. 

Committee members also discussed ways to better protect overseas Korean nationals and to improve consular services for them.

The 19th presidential election was held in 2017 to fill a vacancy due to the unprecedented impeachment of the former president. Despite political and social turmoil as well as the short period of time given for its preparation, the election was successfully held thanks to thorough planning and close cooperation among relevant government agencies.

 MOFA established a Task Force shortly after the impeachment ruling and played an active role in the preparations for the overseas voting. The Ministry built a close As a side note, the Committee on the Overseas Koreans Policy was established in 1996, pursuant to a presidential directive, with a view to coordinating policies regarding overseas Koreans. Since its establishment, 18 meetings have been convened by the Committee and 26 meetings have been held at the sub-Committee level.

## 3) Celebration Of All Koreans Day

The 2017 All Koreans Day celebration was held under the slogan "Enhancing Overseas Koreans' Sense of Pride in and Belonging to Korea." The event was attended by more than 600 guests, including approximately 450 Korean community leaders from 80 countries.

The Korean Community Leaders Convention was held on the sidelines of the All Koreans Day celebration. The Convention provided a venue for various lectures and seminars including discussions with government officials, policy forums with major political parties, and presentations on best practices of Korean communities around the world.

## 4) Support For Overseas Korean Communities

The 16" World Korean Business Convention, a platform for Korean entrepreneurs at home and overseas to expand their business networks and enhance their business capabilities, was held from October 25 to 27 in Changwon, a southeastern city of Korea.

The event, despite being overshadowed by North Korea's nuclear provocations, was attended by a record number of participants (5,000 participants) from all corners of the world. During the event, 110,513 one-on-one business meetings generated US$190 million worth of business. In addition, on the sidelines of the event, a Job Fair was held for young Koreans seeking job opportunities at Korean companies abroad.

The Job Fair helped 92 young Koreans to obtain overseas internship opportunities.

In this regard, the event also served to create jobs, one of the key policy objectives of the Korean government. 

In addition, the 20th Next Generation Convention was held from November 6 to 10.

The Convention provided a valuable opportunity for young Korean leaders playing active roles in their residing countries to reconnect with their motherland and with one another.

The Convention was of particular importance as 2017 marked the 20th anniversary since the Convention was first launched in 1997. It also served as a "reunion," attended by 45 former participants and 70 new participants, with the aim of building a long-lasting network, rather than a one-off meeting, among young Korean leaders around the globe.

In 2017, MOFA held 39 working holiday information sessions at universities across Korea. For more country-specific information, MOFA also co-hosted sessions with Canadian, Australian, and Irish diplomatic missions to Korea to further provide information on everyday life and safety. Programs with previous participants appointed as MOFA's Working Holiday Friends extended the opportunity to share personal experiences and provide guidance to future participants.

Furthermore, overseas missions have held regular meetings with working holiday participants and have provided information on safety and jobs online. In particular,

![123_image_0.png](123_image_0.png) the Working Holiday Consultants, operated by the Korean Embassy in Australia, have offered help and customized services for working holiday participants by organizing regular orientations and handing out guidebooks.

Koreans who wish to travel around the world benefit from the expansion of the visa waiver agreements. By the end of 2017, visa waiver agreements with 106 countries had entered into force.

In 2017, Korea signed MOUs on the mutual recognition of driver's licenses with the State of Wisconsin, State of Oklahoma, and State of Arizona. The MOU with the State of Alabama was also renewed. An agreement between Korea and Nicaragua on the mutual recognition and exchange of national driving licenses entered into force on April 5, 2017.

In 2017, visa waiver agreements with Mozambique for diplomatic and official passport holders, and with Jordan for diplomatic passport holders entered into force.

Korea also newly signed an agreement with Vanuatu for diplomatic and official passport holders.

1 Introduction to the Advanced e-Passport & System Reform to Provide Enhanced Services for Korean Nationals Commencing with an agreement with Australia in 1995, Korea has concluded bilateral agreements or MOUs on working holiday programs with 22 countries to date. In 2017, MOFA signed a Working Holiday Agreement with Spain and amended Following the decision of the Passport Administration Subcommittee in June 2016, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been working to implement a more advanced PC
Chapter 4
(Poly Carbonate) type e-Passport, which is more secure and is of improved quality and design, by 2020.

In this regard, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs laid the groundwork for the advanced e-Passport in 2017, such as designing the advanced e-Passport by conducting specialized research via Business Process Reengineering/Information Strategy Planning (BPR/ISP) and improving the passport information system and specifications for the passport issuance system.

## 2) System Reform To Provide Enhanced Services For Korean Nationals (1) Issuance Of Braille Passports (Braille Sticker Attached)

Introducing the world's first braille passport for the blind with the general passport information in braille, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been issuing the new passport through its domestic passport offices and diplomatic missions abroad since April 20, 2017.

## (2) Amendment To The Enforcement Rules Of The Passport Act With Regard To Written Name In Passport

On June 27, 2017, MOFA amended the Enforcement Rules of the Passport Act to allow applicants to utilize a foreign name in his/her passport if the applicant's Korean alphabet name stated on the Family Relation Certificate has the same transliteration with the foreign name.

In the past, only persons who were naturalized Korean citizens, persons with multiple nationalities, and permanent residents could exceptionally use foreign names. However, to meet the increasing preference for use of foreign names in line with globalization, MOFA relaxed the previous regulation for romanizing the Korean alphabet name into Latin script.

(3) Termination of the Issuance of Residence Passports in Accordance with the Amendment to the Emigration Act MOFA began to issue ordinary passports instead of residence passports to emigrants as of December 21, 2017.

Since residence passports were originally intended for the sole administrative purpose of identifying emigrants, MOFA amended the Emigration Act and the Enforcement Decree of the Passport Act and deleted the article on residence passports for improved efficiency.

## (4) Simplification Of Civil Petition Documents

On June 27, 2017, MOFA amended the Enforcement Rules of the Passport Act to reduce the number of civil petition documents required for submission. Furthermore, applicants no longer need to submit a registration certificate for a person with a disability when applying for a braille passport, nor a copy of the applicant's passport when applying for the permission for exceptional use of a passport. (5) Increase in Issuing Offices of the Authenticity Certificate for Passport Copies In the past, only MOFA and embassies abroad had issued the Authenticity Certificate for Passport Copies. However, starting from April 10, 2017, all regional passport offices now issue the Authenticity Certificate, which will help provide better services to applicants living outside of Seoul.

## (6) Safety Enhancement Of Korean Passports

In the event of the loss or stolen passport, the time at which the lost or stolen passport is no longer valid was amended from the time the passport holder submits an application for reissuance to the time the passport holder reports the loss (This act entered into force on June 22, 2017). As a result, information on a lost or stolen passport can be shared promptly with Interpol and preventing the possibility of international crimes such as counterfeiting or falsification.

system is implemented. From May to December 2017, some preliminary work for G4K was completed year-round, including Information Strategy Planning (ISP) and a keynote presentation to officials from 13 different governmental bodies.

The new system, it is expected to significantly reduce the need for walk-in applications by streamlining the process and issuing the Certificate of Overseas Korean registration and Certificate of Emigration Report online.

MOFA has gradually increased the number of passport offices to provide better access for Korean nationals. As a result, since the end of 2017, Koreans can apply for a passport in virtually all of the regional governments (a total of 248 passport offices
- including eight local branch offices) and obtain it in four to five days at any passport office.

In 2017, 159 overseas missions provided 1,083 rounds of circuit consular services, handling approximately 57,477 cases on various matters such as passport issuance, notarization, and conscription consultation. Circuit consular services have also provided opportunities to hold consultative meetings with overseas Koreans and to enhance cooperation with local police and immigration authorities. 

MOFA has been running the Passport Education & Research Center (PERC) since March 2014. The PERC has seven specialists who regularly provide a systematic training program on passport laws and regulations to staff members of domestic passport offices and overseas missions.

In 2017, the PERC hosted group education sessions at the PERC headquarters for 311 passport office staff members, and held on-site training at 40 passport offices and eight overseas missions. MOFA expanded its services and developed new convenient consular services for overseas Koreans.

In 2017, MOFA launched a new electronic system for the issuance of driver's license certificates in the English language and for online registration of overseas Koreans. Furthermore, MOFA is expecting a breakthrough in consular services by 2020 when the G4K (Government for Overseas Koreans) consular service innovation

## 2 Implementing The Mofa Innovation Roadmap Launch Of The Special Task Force Team For Organizational Innovation Cultivating An Innovative Culture And Changing The Way Of Working

The MOFA Innovation Roadmap lays out MOFA's innovative vision and core values as well as specific tasks under the following overarching themes: people, the national interest, and capacity-building. Firstly, the goal of people-themed tasks is to better protect Korean nationals and develop and implement diplomatic policies that can engage the public and win their trust. Specific assignments in these tasks are establishing a Crisis Management Division, a Center for Participatory Diplomacy, and

![127_image_0.png](127_image_0.png) a Division for Inspection.

Secondly, tasks under the theme of national interest include restructuring the organization to diversify the diplomatic scope and establishing a Bureau of Diplomatic Strategy.

Finally, tasks for capacity-building are mainly focused on reforming human resources management to strengthen competitiveness and ensure fairness in personnel management.

Based on the Roadmap, MOFA carried out the following measures to innovate its organizational structure: reforming its human resources management system including opening up diplomatic positions to non-diplomats; recruiting more consular services personnel; adopting a zero-tolerance policy for misconduct; and changing the recruitment process for diplomat candidates of the Korea National Diplomatic Academy. Moreover, in order to carry out the remaining tasks faithfully, MOFA drew up implementation plans, which contain input details, concrete work programs, time schedules and sources of funding .

To better respond to the rapidly changing diplomatic environment, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) continued to promote organizational innovations to strengthen its diplomatic capacity. As part of such efforts, MOFA officially launched the Special Task Force Team on Organizational Innovation on July 11, 2017. 

In line with the new administration's governing philosophy, the Task Force set
"Putting People First, Pursuing the National Interest" as its guiding vision and outlined the key objectives and priorities for innovation. The Task Force had three subcommittees each tasked with managing human resources, restructuring the organization, and changing the organizational culture respectively. They identified barriers to the efficiency and effectiveness of MOFA and came up with various innovative measures to remove them. On September 29, 2017, the Task Force published the MOFA Innovation Roadmap, which contains 38 innovation tasks, after conducting a public survey, a full-scale organizational diagnosis, and consultations with the Advisory Committee.

While implementing structural reform, MOFA also took measures to further improve its working conditions and cultivate an innovative culture. To promote work-life balance,

# Building An Innovation System To Enhance Diplomatic Capacity

Chapter 1 MOFA encouraged more officials to work on a flexible work schedule, abolished the practice of forming diplomatic spouses' associations in overseas missions, and carried out a series of innovation pilot projects. MOFA also held Town Hall Meetings and conducted a mentoring program to facilitate internal communication.

## 2 Development Of A Monitoring System To Measure Progress In The Innovation Process

In order to make its innovation process sustainable, MOFA established the Division for Implementation of Innovation on October 13, 2017. The division monitors and facilitates the implementation of the tasks laid out in the Innovation Roadmap and finds new creative ideas to enhance MOFA's diplomatic capacity. It launched the Online Innovation Platform and the Advisory Committee, which is composed of civilian experts and officials from related ministries, to objectively assess MOFA's innovation process.

## To Draw Up A Reorganization Proposal To Carry Out The National Tasks Of The New Government

Following the inauguration of the new government, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
(MOFA) prepared a proposal for its reorganization in order to implement national tasks such as the protection of the safety and rights of Korean nationals abroad. The proposal includes the establishment of the Crisis Management Division for protecting and supporting the more than 26 million people traveling abroad.

According to the plan, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is to rearrange its organization more efficiently to address the rapidly changing diplomatic environment in a proactive way. For example, the Public Diplomacy and Cultural Affairs Bureau is to be established by integrating scattered public diplomacy functions while the newly reformed Office of the Director-General for Strategy is to play more focused roles in planning policies and analyzing diplomatic situations.

## 2 Strengthening Diplomatic Capacity For The Successful Establishment Of An Advanced Diplomatic System 1) Strengthening The Expertise Of Foreign Service Officers 3) Encouraging Openness In Public Service Sector Through Open Positions 2) Merit-Based Human Resources Management And Encouraging

MOFA applies merit-based principles in its human resources management to place the right individual with the right talent in the right position. Therefore, appointment decisions for MOFA's Heads of Missions are based on capability rather than seniority. In 2017, MOFA selected capable personnel who have served as Director-Generals as the heads of major missions and appointed Director-level personnel to head missions in challenging nations.

In order to deal with escalating diplomatic demand and effectively manage human resources, MOFA has been strengthening the expertise of its personnel, applying merit-based principles in human resources management, establishing a familyfriendly working environment, and expanding its open position system and personnel exchange program.

At the same time, MOFA has been assigning more women to senior posts in accordance with the growing number of women in the workplace. The Korean government, in 2017, appointed its first female Foreign Minister and appointed females to the positions of the Head of Mission in Milan, the Deputy Minister for Multilateral and Global Affairs, and the President of the Institute of Foreign Affairs and National Security. Moreover, MOFA plans to increase the percentage of its female Director-level officials up to 20% during the incumbent administration. The Ministry also endeavors to build a family-friendly working environment in order to expand the role of female officials and enhance their capacities. As part of this effort, MOFA seeks to assign diplomat couples, if possible, to the same overseas missions so that they can serve together.

MOFA has recruited and trained talented Foreign Service Officer candidates through its Program for Foreign Service Officers since the abolition of the Foreign Service Examination in 2013. Well into its fourth year, the Program for Foreign Service Officers seeks to nurture competent diplomats equipped with great verbal and written communication skills and negotiation skills. The program trains candidates focusing on the following four areas: Sense of Mission (SOM), Knowledge of Areas and Functions (KAF), Communication, Networking, and Negotiation (CNN), and Foreign Languages for Diplomats (FLD).

Also, by conducting multi-faceted diplomatic competency assessments on its Counselors (Director-level) and Foreign Service Officers at Director-General and Head-of-Mission levels, MOFA seeks to ensure that Foreign Service Officers strengthen and maintain expertise throughout their entire career. In 2017, MOFA
conducted diplomatic competency assessments on applicants for open positions and the personnel exchange program as well as four regular assessments for Foreign Service Officers.

In line with the government's personnel management policies, MOFA has been increasing the number of its open positions to utilize outstanding human resources from both public and private sectors. Numerous senior posts have been allocated as open positions, including major posts at MOFA headquarters such as the Director- General for Policy Planning and the Deputy Spokesperson, as well as many other prominent positions in major diplomatic missions abroad. Furthermore, the open position system is applied to Director-level positions at MOFA headquarters including the Director of Cultural Exchanges and Cooperation Division, the Director of Global Environment and Science, and the Director of Bilateral Economic Affairs a Family-friendly Working Atmosphere Coordination Division. In 2017, MOFA designated the Director for Foreign Language Education as an open position with a view to providing even better foreign language education to diplomats.

## Capacity Development For Diplomats And Public Officials

The Korea National Diplomatic Academy (KNDA) offered the Program for Foreign Service Officer Candidates, which consists of more than 40 subjects in four major areas: Sense of Mission (SOM), Communication, Networking, and Negotiation (CNN),
Knowledge of Areas and Functions (KAF), and Foreign Language for Diplomats (FLD). In addition to the regular subjects, the KNDA provided special lectures to Foreign Service Officer Candidates by inviting eminent scholars and public figures with experience in international affairs such as Ban Ki-moon, the former UN
Secretary General, Jia Qingguo, Dean of the School of International Studies of Peking University, and Ichiro Ozawa, leader of the Japanese opposition Liberal Party.

The year 2017 program for Foreign Service Officer Candidates comprised not only of semester courses (three semesters, 12 weeks per semester), but also of various special courses including field learning in Korea and abroad, and on-thejob training at HQ. The main purpose of providing special courses to Foreign Service Officer Candidates was to strengthen their practical ability which they only

International Conference and Negotiation Program for government and public institution employees. The KNDA also has strived to deepen foreign diplomats' understanding of Korea, providing the Partnership Program for diplomats from developing countries; and the Introduction of Korea Program for foreign diplomats newly assigned to Korea.

The KNDA provided customized job training programs based on career development levels and leadership training programs for members of MOFA in 2017. To enhance competencies, diplomatic competency training and diplomatic competency assessments have been implemented.

 The KNDA has made efforts to equip foreign service and consular officials with improved responsiveness from the field to nationals and in the prevention of overseas accidents and terrorism by introducing an intensive three-week course on consular affairs into training courses including programs for career diplomats assigned to Korean overseas missions, newly assigned attachés, and heads of mission.

The Institute of Foreign Affairs and National Security (IFANS) is responsible for conducting research and analysis on the government's foreign policy and diplomatic strategy, and developing policy recommendations on pending diplomatic issues.

In addition, IFANS continues to endeavor to build a wide-ranging policy research network with academia and research institutions at home and abroad, and to promote public awareness of Korea's foreign policy. 

Providing our diplomats with a variety of foreign language education and training programs to improve language fluency and promote cultural awareness has been one of the KNDA's foremost aims and functions. Language and cultural competences are the quintessential attributes required for diplomats in an increasingly complex and rapidly changing international and political environment. Our featured programs include intensive English-immersion courses both for Foreign Service Officer Candidates and newly-recruited consular officers, customized local language programs for diplomats assigned to overseas missions prior to and during their posts and on-site and online learning for the entire Ministry staff throughout the year. Furthermore, each year, more than 40 selected Ministry staff participate in our Overseas Training Program either to pursue academic degrees or for immersion in intensive language programs for up to three years. The Overseas Training Program is specially designed for our diplomats to further refine language fluency as well as to maximize cultural involvement, and has so far provided our diplomats with unrivaled language and cultural training opportunities.

In addition, the KNDA has been making efforts to expand the global capabilities of the Korean government in the public sector through external training programs for those working in governmental and public sectors, such as the Global Leadership Program for high-ranking government officials and public institution staff; the In 2017, IFANS held a total of 15 international academic conferences such as the IFANS Global Conference, 2ªª Network of Tri-lateral Cooperation Think-Tanks (ROK,
China, and Japan), 2017 Seoul Academy of International Law, and ROK-EU Strategic Dialogue and others aimed at enhancing its research competencies and expanding the scope of academic exchanges at home and abroad.

Furthermore, in an attempt to support the government's national political agenda and foreign policy, the Institute rolled out research programs on the trust-building process on the Korean Peninsula, ROK-US alliance, and middle-power diplomacy, and facilitated meetings such as the Round Table for the People-Centered Diplomacy of the New Government, Workshop for ASEAN Policy of the New Government, Joint Academic Conference Hosted by Four Major Government-run Research Institutions, and Seminar on the North Korean Nuclear Issue.

IFANS also published a series of research papers including IFANS FORECAST,
Analysis on the Global Issue, IFANS FOCUS, and Policy Reports to share the results of seminars, conferences, and meetings held in 2017. These reports not only provided policy proposals on pending diplomatic agendas, but also contributed to enhancing the general understanding of the public of international affairs and diplomatic issues.

In addition to conferences and reports, IFANS' four research centers (Center for Chinese Studies, Center for Diplomatic History Studies, Center for International Law, and Center for Japanese Studies) have conducted in-depth research in their respective fields and built extensive academic networks through various dialogues, conferences, and seminars with domestic and overseas research institutes.

 IFANS has strengthened its channels for strategic cooperation by holding bilateral or multilateral academic conferences on a regular basis with the United States, China, Japan, and Russia. Moreover, it has diversified the scope of regional studies and partnerships by holding annual academic conferences with various partners such as the European Union Institute for Security Studies, Visegrad Group, Geneva Centre for Security Studies, and the Prince Saud Al-Faisal Institute of Diplomatic Studies of Saudi Arabia.

 Lastly, IFANS hosted the IFANS Talks (public lecture program), the IFANS Debate
(open debate session), and KNDA Lecture Series (guest lecture program) as part of its efforts to promote public diplomacy, which promoted public awareness of the government's major foreign policy and global issues as well as interactive communication with the people.

## � Strengthening Diplomatic Capacity With The Heads Of Mission Evaluation System

The Heads of Mission Evaluation System, which was first introduced in June 2011 with a view to achieving a more systematic assessment of the various aspects of the Heads of Mission's performance, is subdivided into seven Major Activity Areas including political, economic, consular, and public diplomacy and two Priority Projects selected by each Head of Mission. It is a comprehensive and strict evaluation process that helps to improve the overall outcome of diplomatic missions' activities and, at the same time, to ensure that these activities contribute to the achievement of diplomatic goals.
