**I. INTRODUCTION**

**1. Purpose**

This Military Strategy defines the manner in which the Armed Forces will be organized, managed, and
operated in order to meet the missions assigned to the Armed Forces in the Defense Strategy. This
document also serves as the foundation for the development of all future doctrine, regulations, and
directives throughout the Armed Forces. The Military Strategy elaborates, from the military viewpoint, the
possible threats; analyzes risks; describes the military capabilities required to execute the strategy;
delineates the principles for structuring, training, and operating the Armed Forces; and sustainment
requirements as the Armed Forces transition from the current legacy, unilaterally-oriented force to a
modern coalition compatible force. This strategy is based upon the current geo-strategic environment, the
available resources of the state, and on the determination to achieve the best possible means of securing
the vital interests of Slovakia. The concepts in this strategy will be further developed in the forthcoming
long-term reform and modernization implementation plan of the Armed Forces. This plan is intended to
detail the ways and means to structure, train, educate, develop and sustain the Slovak Armed Forces so as
to ensure the successful accomplishment of all missions, either unilaterally or within the coalition defense
structure of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and other operations under the auspices of
appropriate security organizations. The best method to achieve the objectives of safeguarding the security
and sovereignty of Slovakia is through collective defense arrangements. NATO would be the alliance of
choice and is considered the organization most desirable to be interoperable with in order to meet those


-----

objectives.

**2. Basic Principles of the Defense Strategy**

The current strategic documents, which serve as the basis of this document, articulates the applicable
principles by which defense planning and military operations are to be carried out. The applicable principles
for the Armed Forces are:

2.1. For the military, the principle of primacy of peaceful resolution to all conflicts and disputes serves to
define and limit the scope of defense planning to those missions required for the defense of the sovereignty
of the state and that of Slovakia's allies.

2.2. Complexity, or full integration of all components of the national defense system determines the
requirement to maximize the resources available to the state by ensuring that redundancy is minimized in
the plans and responsibilities of each component of the defense system. This principle requires that each
component of the defense system contribute to the overall defense effort in the most efficient manner.

2.3. Deterrence underscores the necessity to maintain, in peacetime, a thoroughly competent Armed Force
that is professionally led, well trained and equipped, and capable of accomplishing all assigned missions.
The principle is founded on the concept that prospective adversaries will be less likely to employ force
against a state that has demonstrated the ability and will to act decisively when the vital interests of that
state, or of its allies, are directly threatened.

2.4. The commitment of Slovak policy to peace and stability within the region places vital importance upon
membership in alliances and security arrangements whose goals are consistent with such stability. To that
end, the major objective of all defense plans must have, as their focus, full interoperability with NATO in
order to contribute to the full range of alliance missions.

2.5. The most critical principle is proportionality, and affordability, ensuring that all plans for the
modernization of, and the future direction for, the state's defense system must take into consideration a
realistic appraisal of the state's ability to resource those plans. All defense plans must incrementally
prioritize acceptable risks in an incremental approach to build a force that is affordable and sustainable
under current economic restraints. Any expansion of the defense structure must be planned for periods of
corresponding economic growth.

2.6. The Defense Strategy directs that all decision-making processes in defense planning, and command
and control of military operations, are based upon the principle of civilian control of the military.

It is in keeping with these principles that this Military Strategy is promulgated.

**II. SECURITY CHALLENGES AND THREATS TO SLOVAKIA**

While conducting an analysis of the security environment of Slovakia, both the threats and the probability of
their occurrence have been considered. The security threats are categorized by the probability of their
occurrence and the warning time expected to be available for the preparation and deployment of the Armed
Forces to respond to those threats.

The current international environment is characterized by the end of global confrontation, which significantly
decreases the probability of major armed conflict. More than 90% of Slovakia is surrounded by NATO or
European Union (EU) countries and, as a result, the probability of any direct external military threat to
Slovakia is low. However, as the threat of global confrontation recedes, all states are now faced with the
threats imposed by the outbreak and escalation of regional armed conflicts. The threats posed by such
regional conflicts, although of lower probability at the present time, do constitute a realistic threat to
Slovakia. In accordance with the above, the security threats that the Armed Forces of Slovakia may be
required to respond to can be characterized as follows:

**1. Military Threats.**

Military threats to the Slovak Republic are those activities primarily involving the use of military forces and
means which threaten the security of the Slovak Republic.


-----

1.1. Major Armed Conflict.

The current likelihood of this type of conflict, as envisaged during the Cold War, is low and the warning and
preparation time can be expected to be reasonably long. Such determinations of warning and preparation
time must be further developed through a detailed analysis of this specific threat. However, the current
environment could change and the conditions for major armed conflict develop, significantly threatening the
security of Slovakia.

1.2. Regional Armed Conflict.

The proximity of Slovakia to areas of possible regional tensions increases the likelihood that Slovakia would
be effected by regional armed conflict. In addition to the threat of direct armed conflict, this situation could
include asymmetric challenges such as information warfare, psychological warfare, and unconventional
combat operations. The warning and preparation time would be shorter than that of major armed conflict
and must be analyzed in detail.

**2. Non-military Threats.**

Non-military threats to the Slovak Republic are those activities in which non-military means are
predominantly employed.that threaten the security of the Slovak Republic.

2.1. General non-military threats.

General non-military threats include emergencies other than armed conflict, such as: terrorist activities;
illegal weapons transfer, including nuclear chemical or biological weapons; uncontrolled migration or
massive refugee flow; religious or ethnic extremism and rivalries; international organized crime; social
unrest; and a number of other activities that may lead to armed conflict, if unresolved.

Of particular importance to the security of the state is the non-military threat posed by international
terrorism. Given the rise in frequency and the magnitude of recent international terrorist operations, the
military must be prepared to provide military-unique support to the appropriate civilian agencies in response
to such incidents. Counterterrorism capabilities must be developed and maintained within the Armed
Forces to ensure rapid response times for such support operations. Specifically, the Armed Forces must
emphasize enhancements of counterrorism training and equipment for Special Forces and intelligence
organizations.

2.2. Natural disasters and major ecological accidents are also non-military threats. This category is the
most probable, and least predictable, of the threats to Slovakia. These events have the potential of greatly
affecting the quality of the environment, the security and health of the general population, and the economic
health of the country. The Armed Forces have some organic capabilities that are available to assist state
and local authorities in countering these threats.

Non-military threats are a significant consideration in the overall security environment of Slovakia. They
must, therefore, be dealt with in close co-operation with other state authorities. The Armed Forces must be
prepared, according to applicable legislation, to provide support to the non-military agencies of the nation,
or of other countries, as a part of a collective effort in countering such threats.

**3. Summary of Threats to Slovakia**

A summary of the threats currently facing Slovakia, in order of probability, is listed below. Also included is
an assessment of the impact of each threat, categorized from high to low, on the vital interests of Slovakia
should such threats occur:

|Threat|Likelihood|Impact on Vital Interests|
|---|---|---|
|Major Armed Conflict|Low Probability|High|
|Regional Armed Conflict|Moderate Probability|Moderate/High|
|General Non-military Threats|High Probability|Moderate/Low|
|Natural Disasters/Major Ecological Incidents|Unpredictable|Low/Moderate|


-----

**4. Risk Assessment**

4.1. General.

Optimally, the defense planning process would entail the structuring of the Armed Forces of a state to
simultaneously counter all of the possible threats to the state's security. However, Slovakia as most
countries, does not possess the resources to maintain a defense structure large enough to accomplish all
of those missions. To that end, a careful process of analysis that considers the known threats, their
likelihood of occurrence, expected warning and preparation time, the severity of the impact of their
occurrence to the vital interests of the state, and the military force structure required to counter each threat
must be conducted to determine the overall size and structure of the Armed Forces that will be required to
ensure the national defense. When, as is normally the case, available resources limit the size/structure of
the Armed Forces to less than what would be required to meet all of the possible threats, defense planners
must make recommendations as to which threats, in priority, can be countered with sufficient force structure
based upon the resources available, and which threats cannot. Threats that are not planned to be
countered with sufficient force structure constitute the risk that a state must be willing to accept in
maintaining a defense system that is affordable and practical.

4.2. Risk Assessment for the Defense of Slovakia in the Current Threat Environment.

Given the constrained resources currently available to Slovakia for defense spending for the near term, the
realistically affordable force structure will require the acceptance of some amount of risk. Specifically, this
Military Strategy acknowledges and accepts the following risks:

4.2.1. Risk for Military Threats.

4.2.1.1. Major Armed Conflict.

No level of defense spending would provide Slovakia with a force capable of unilaterally countering a direct
threat from the type of conflict envisioned during the cold war period. Given the low probability of this threat
and the likelihood that alliances would be quickly formed with other democratic countries to counter such a
threat, Slovakia accepts a high level of risk imposed as it develops a defense structure which is not
primarily focused on Major Armed Conflict but which is within the resources available through its military
contribution to collective defense organizations.

4.2.1.2. Regional Armed Conflict.

Given the greater likelihood of the occurrence of this threat in the current security environment, Slovakia
can only accept a moderate level of risk inherent in these threats and must design a force structure capable
of countering them unilaterally. This level of risk may be reduced by the formation of ad hoc alliances or
coalitions with other external security organizations to counter this threat. However, assistance from such
external sources may not be as likely as in response to the threat of major armed conflict. The risks posed
by constrained force structure in response to both Major Armed Conflict and Regional Armed Conflict may
also be reduced by structuring a mobilization plan that is tailored to phase in Long Term Build-Up Forces
based upon a detailed and realistic assessment of the likely warning and force preparation times for each of
those threats.

4.2.2. Risks for Non-military Threats.

The mission of the Slovak Armed Forces is to serve as only the supporting component against nonmilitary
threats to the security of Slovakia. Although taking its supporting mission seriously, the Armed Forces must
maintain its force structure to fulfill its primary mission of countering military threats. Response to nonmilitary threats normally requires specialized equipment and skills not usually maintained by forces that are
focused on combat missions. Therefore, risk must be accepted that the Armed Forces will not respond to all
of these non-military threats in as timely a manner, or as well task-organized, as may be desirable.

**III. THE STRATEGY**

1.1. This Military Strategy focuses on ensuring that Slovakia remains secure from external threats by
supporting peace and stability within the region and by the deterrence of adversaries that may directly
threaten the sovereign territory of Slovakia, our vital interests, or those of our allies. To achieve this
strategic goal, the Defense Strategy has made, as its highest priority, the modernization of the Armed
Forces so as to contribute to the full range of alliance missions. In support of this goal, the framework for


-----

the Military Strategy of the Armed Forces will be a three-tiered approach:

**Be prepared to defend the vital interests of the state while operating as a unilateral force while**
**concurrently**
**Prepare for NATO accession while concurrently, in order to achieve the above objectives**
**Prepare the detailed long-term plan, utilizing the Defense Planning System, to design, develop**
**and build the modern Armed Forces of the future.**

1.2. In pursuing this three-tiered strategy, the underlying principle applied to all decisions must be
proportionality and affordability. All programs that are developed must be achievable within the resources
available to the state and apportioned by the Government of the Slovak Republic (GOSR) to the Armed
Forces. To achieve affordability, hard decisions as to relative priorities must be made and well-reasoned
risks must be taken. In this period of relative peace and stability, it is considered a prudent risk to downsize
the current force and infrastructure in order to provide savings that can be applied to priority initiatives.

1.3. For the near term, those priority initiatives are those issues directly related to NATO compatibility and
interoperability: personnel related issues such as creating a more professional force with greater reliance
upon junior officers and noncommissioned officers; introducing new training management systems to
ensure intensive, combat-focused unit training; and providing greater funding for quality of life issues in
order to attract and maintain the best soldiers and airmen for a more professional Armed Forces. This force
will, through recruiting and retention initiatives, place less reliance upon conscripts and move progressively
towards greater reliance upon professional personnel.

1.4. Concurrent with the above initiatives, the Armed Forces must fund and accomplish those
programs/initiatives related to NATO accession. These priority initiatives include, but are not limited to,
upgrade of command and control systems; continued development of host-nation support capabilities; and
ASOC connectivity. The Armed Forces will continue to participate will continue to participate in NATO
operations and exercises and operations under the auspices of other international peace and humanitarian
organizations, in accordance with appropriate legislation.

1.5. Parallel with the above mentioned activities, the Armed Forces must engage itself now in the process
of designing and developing the force of the future, "SR Force 2010". Such a force must be capable of
operating, as a member of a coalition organization, across the entire spectrum of war, from High Intensity
Conflict to Operations Other Than War. To achieve this goal, within the budgets envisioned, a new doctrine
and force structure must be designed to replace the current legacy force structure. This new force must be
the force for the 21st Century that is lethal, flexible, efficient, mobile, technical, sustainable, and fully
interoperable with NATO forces.

1.6. These activities will require the designation of firm priorities, detailed and coordinated planning, the
direct involvement of all members of the Armed Forces, and strong public and political support.

**IV. THE ROLES, MISSIONS, AND TASKS OF THE SLOVAK ARMED FORCES**

**1. Roles of the Slovak Armed Forces**

The Armed Forces are the decisive component of the state defense system. The Slovak Armed Forces
have the primary responsibility for the defense of the country against all military threats, for potentially
contributing to the full range of alliance missions, and for providing support to other national agencies
against all non-military threats to the state.

**2. Missions and Tasks of the Slovak Armed Forces**

2.1. Missions. The Armed Forces must be prepared and capable, in peacetime and in crisis situations, to
accomplish the following missions:

2.1.1. Ensure a credible deterrence and, if this fails, defend the sovereignty, independence and territorial
integrity of Slovakia, and that of its allies, against any external threat of armed aggression. Be prepared to
conduct such operations unilaterally or as a coalition member.

2.1.2. Participate in multinational peace enforcement, peacekeeping, and operations involving humanitarian
assistance, under international auspices, in accordance with appropriate legislation,.


-----

2.1.3. In accordance with the laws of Slovakia, provide support to state and local government agencies, or
as a member of international organizations, to counter non-military threats and participate in crisis
resolution.

2.2. Tasks of the Armed Forces. Based upon a preliminary analysis, the Armed Forces must be prepared to
successfully accomplish the following tasks in support of the three missions listed above:

2.2.1. Maintain a High Readiness Force, consisting of at least a battalion-sized element, with appropriate
air elements and other supporting units. This force must be maintained at a high state of readiness, be fully
deployable, interoperable with allies and sustainable, and be prepared to conduct missions for the defense
of the state, conflict prevention, peacekeeping, as well as for contribution to the full range of NATO
operations. This force must be capable of contributing to the collective defense of NATO or other
operations under the auspices of appropriate security organizations.

2.2.2. Maintain Forces at Lower Readiness, consisting of at least a brigade-sized element, with appropriate
air elements and other supporting units. The Reinforcement Force though at lower readiness will be
capable of conducting operations, for defense of the state as well as for contribution to Article V NATO
operations. Additionally, will provide sustainability, relief, or reinforcement for the High Readiness Force.

2.2.3. Maintain Long-Term Build-Up Forces that will be mobilized for the defense of the state and its allies,
as required to counter specific threats in accordance with the appropriate warning and preparation time.

2.2.4. Provide for the strategic functions of C3, early warning, military intelligence, reconnaissance, and
surveillance.

2.2.5. Maintain appropriate air personnel and equipment in order to provide for the continuous defense of
the sovereignty of Slovak airspace and, after admission to NATO, for the protection of integrated NATO
airspace. Additionally, provide appropriate air elements to the High Readiness Forces, Forces of Lower
Readiness and Long-Term Build- Up Forces.

2.2.6. Maintain the capability to receive allied reinforcements, under the appropriate circumstances, and to
provide other Host Nation Support activities as may be required.

2.2.7. Be prepared to provide support, as directed, to other ministries, government agencies, or local
authorities, in accordance with law.

2.2.8. Be prepared to rapidly provide Special Forces and intelligence assets to assist other agencies in the
conduct of counterterrorism operations. Such support will require enhancements of current training and
equipment requirement

2.2.9. Maintain facilities and activities for training, sustaining, and supporting the Armed Forces, to include
support for deployed forces.

2.2.10. Maintain readiness and increased interoperability through participation in international exercises.

**V. CAPABILITIES, STRUCTURE, TRAINING, SUSTAINMENT AND READINESS OF THE ARMED**
**FORCES**

**1. Capabilities**

The strategic goal of Slovakia is to build a relatively small but high-quality force that is appropriately armed
and well-trained and to integrate that force into NATO´s collective defense arrangements. This force must
be capable, unilaterally in the near term, or later in co-operation with NATO armed forces, of defending the
sovereignty of the state, or its allies, against any direct military and non-military threats.

**2. Command and Control of the Armed Forces**

Command of the Armed Forces, in accordance with the Constitution and current law, passes from the
President, the Commander-in Chief, through the Chief of the General Staff to the operational commanders
throughout the Armed Forces. Civilian Control is established through the Constitution and law which has
established the President, National Council, Government, and the Minister of Defense in positions of


-----

controlling the Armed Forces.

**3. The Future Structure of the Armed Forces**

The current structure will be transitioned to a future force that will be capable of fighting across the entire
spectrum of war as a member of a coalition force. Planning will emphasize force structure that is affordable
and capable of meeting known or emerging threats as a member of a coalition force. The emerging force
will emphasize mobility, flexibility, and the leveraging of new technologies in armaments, communications,
information management, intelligence, and targeting capabilities in order to operate on the battlefield of the
future. The force of the future will be designed to fight according to a new and emerging doctrine of
operating as a joint and combined force to meet and countering any enemy. New concepts, such as
capability-sharing with other NATO armed forces, will be explored to maximize combat capability and
minimize costs. Initiatives will be developed to reduce the current ratio of support-to-combat units, the size
of headquarters structures, and to transfer the command of units which are currently centrally controlled to
appropriate combat commanders. This future force will be developed and gradually implemented within the
Slovak Armed Forces according to the long-term modernization plan and as funding permits.

**4. Preparation of the Armed Forces**

4.1. Training.

Well-trained personnel are crucial combat enablers for the Armed Forces. Intense, realistic, battle-focused,
joint and combined training is the basis for developing a modern professional force capable of deterring
aggression, and should deterrence fail, capable of countering any aggressor. A high priority for resources
will be given to developing a comprehensive, Armed Forces-wide training management plan that ensures
leader-developed, battle task-oriented, doctrinally correct, realistic individual and collective training at all
echelons of command. Training tasks will be taken from the entire spectrum of combat and non-combat
operations that the Armed Forces have been given the mission to accomplish. Modern methods of training,
such as simulation, will be employed, where possible, to train most efficiently and economically.
Additionally, training will incorporate "lessons learned" from previous training experiences and actual
ongoing operations. To accomplish these strategic training objectives, funds must be allocated, a system of
developing mission-oriented training plans must be implemented, and distracters to unit training must be
minimized. Soldiers and airmen will report to their units only after they are well trained and ready for
integration. Options for revising the current system of Initial Entry Training will be considered, and a high
priority must be given to producing a more efficient system immediately. Realistic training will become the
norm in all units of the Slovak Armed Forces, but priority for training assets and resources must be given to
the units in accordance with their readiness state.

4.2. Education and Professional Development.

A new system of career-long education, and planned assignments of increasing responsibility and authority,
will be implemented throughout the Slovak Armed Forces. Such a system enables quality performance of
the professional service for every professional career field in accordance with the service career
regulations. This professional development system should include:

4.2.1. Basic military education must continue to prepare the applicant for accession to professional service
as fully prepared junior leaders. Student enrollment at these institutions will be planned to meet the
requirements for expanding the proportional number of junior officers, and NCOs in a more western-style
force structure.

4.2.2. Follow-on professional education courses and programs will be implemented to ensure the
systematic professional development of all Commissioned Officers and Noncommissioned Officers
throughout their careers.

4.2.3. Leader Development in a western-style is a new concept for the Slovak Armed Forces. A priority
must be given to developing the concept of leadership, particularly focused on junior officers and the newlyemerging professional NCO corps.

**5. Sustainment of the Armed Forces**

Future military operations of the Slovak Armed Forces contingent will place great demands upon the
logistics support system. The units assigned to the High Readiness Force must have a deployable logistics
support system, which is compatible and interoperable with the armed forces of other NATO countries, or a


-----

mission-specific logistics support system developed to meet unique operational and tactical requirements
and the specific operational environment. The structure for the logistic support of the mobilization forces will
be based upon the analysis of specific threats and risk assessments and with maximum leveraging of local
resources, civilian facilities and installations in the location of the operation.

**6. Readiness of the Armed Forces.**

Attaining and maintaining the appropriate level of combat readiness is the ultimate goal of all units within
the Armed Forces. Combat readiness is measured as the correct combination of personnel fill, training,
equipment on hand, equipment maintenance, and required levels of supply stockage within a given unit. As
a critical part of the modernization effort, standardized and objective criteria for measuring unit readiness
and a process for regularly reporting the readiness status for all units is to be developed. Additionally, a
system must be instituted to ensure that the priority for personnel fill, equipment maintenance and
upgrades, and training resources be given to units in accordance with their assigned readiness posture.
Such a graduated readiness concept will ensure that those units with highest required readiness postures
will be maintained at the highest states of readiness. Units with lower readiness postures, and therefore
with longer deployment notification and preparation time, will be maintained at proportionally lower states of
readiness, with lower percentages of personnel fill, training resources, and gradually modernized
equipment. Such graduated readiness is the most efficient means to ensure readiness with the limited
resources available.

**VI. RESOURCES FOR DEFENSE PLANNING**

Within the Defense Planning system, unified standards, compatible with NATO standards, will be
developed and implemented for the planning, budgeting and use of all resources within the Armed Forces.

**1. Human Resources.**

The most significant resource of the Slovak Armed Forces is its highly motivated, well-trained, and
disciplined personnel. The transition to a more professional, western-style personnel structure is the most
critical component in the modernization plan for the Slovak Armed Forces. Such reforms will provide a
significant increase in the capability of the Armed Forces to successfully accomplish the full range of its
missions. To accomplish the above, the following priority personnel initiatives must be undertaken:

1.1. Reduce the current top-heavy personnel structure and increase accessions of junior officers and
NCOs. Specifically, the new structure must reflect less senior officers and warrant officers with increases in
junior officers and professional junior/senior NCOs. All should be developed with a focus on leadership
through competitive selection for schools and assignments according to their rank. Inspiring leadership and
sound training are the foundations of high-performing military units and are essential for successful defense
modernization. It will be necessary to increase compensation for soldiers and airmen in the short term to
acquire and retain quality personnel. Development of a personnel career structure is crucial in the short
term.

1.2. Develop an effective personnel management system to enable the continued professionalization of the
Armed Forces. The system must be a force enabler that supports mobilization and deployment of active
duty and reserve personnel. The system must facilitate the development of military/civilian personnel
through competitive promotions, selections for schools and progressive assignments. Social support
programs must be a part of the system. This will enhance the recruitment and retention efforts needed in an
increasingly professionalized force.

**2. Material Resources.**

The material resources required to organize, equip, train, develop and sustain the Slovak Armed Forces
must be tailored to meet the Military Strategy for the employment and use of the forces both within the
national territory of Slovakia and outside Slovakia in support of potential NATO alliance operations.
Sustainment and logistical structures of the Armed Forces will be designed to be lean, flexible, and
multipurpose organizations. Supply, maintenance, transportation and medical systems must be responsive
to not only the current but also to the future force design of the Armed Forces. Resource requirements will
be reduced as the Armed Forces progresses through its re-organization, downsizing and modernization
programs. Redundant facilities, installations, bases, depots, repair and production requirements will be
reviewed for consolidation, reduction, elimination and disposal. Obsolescent equipment and materiel will be
removed from the inventory of the Slovak Armed Forces and the possible proceeds from its disposition will
be used to fund repair, upgrade and modernization programs. The standard for these equipment
modernization initiatives will be consistent with the requirements for interoperability with NATO. Logistical


-----

organizations, staffs, and functions must be fully justified and support the Military Strategy. Creative
solutions to materiel requirements for the Slovak Armed Forces from research and development,
acquisition, production, and through the entire materiel life-cycle process must be pursued to increase
efficiencies.

Based upon a careful analysis of the known threats, the expected warning and preparation time, and the
future mission and structure of the Long-Term Build-Up Force, mobilization stocks are to be reduced to
provide cost savings used to fund priority sustainment programs.

**3. Financial Resources.**

The financial resources for the peacetime support of the Armed Forces are provided from the state budget.
During emergencies and wartime, all available national resources may be utilized. The GOSR has publicly
committed to funding the Armed Forces as a minimum at a constant percentage of Gross Domestic Product
(GDP), as of 2001, through the budget for the year 2006.

3.1. Funding priorities will be focused on three broad categories throughout the 2002 to 2010 period:
personnel and training readiness; materiel readiness; and equipment and infrastructure modernization. The
objective of this resourcing strategy is to bring about a proper balance between spending for operational
costs and funding for capital investment for equipment and infrastructure modernization.

3.1.1. For the near term, emphasis will be placed on personnel and training in order to professionalize the
Armed Forces. Programs to reduce the current top-heavy rank structure, form an NCO corps, and introduce
personnel policies that will attract and hold the best possible people in the military will be given a high
priority in resourcing during this period. Resources to improve the quality and intensity of unit and individual
training will also be accorded a high priority during this initial period. This general category will continue to
receive a high priority for funding throughout all phases of the reform. This professionalization process will
be accompanied by adequate equipment and training.

3.1.2. Resources to improve material readiness, both equipment and infrastructure, will gradually increase
over time and achieve a steady state toward the end of the mid term period. This category of funding
includes upgrades to existing equipment and improvements in training and unit facilities

3.1.3. Resourcing for capital investment for new equipment will be available throughout all three periods but
will be limited in the initial periods. Priority modernization programs, such as purchase of NATO-compatible
equipment, will be funded earliest, with the majority of major modernization programs occuring at the end of
the 10-year period. The objective of this funding will be to replace Warsaw Pact equipment and improving
military infrastructure. This equipment modernization program will include the upgrade of existing
equipment, procurement of new equipment and technologies, and other initiatives. Investment levels should
reach 25-30% of the total defense budget by 2010.

**VII. CONCLUSION**

This document is intended to provide both strategic military guidance for the Armed Forces of Slovakia and
planning guidance to senior commanders and staffs to ensure that the process of modernizing our Armed
Forces proceeds in a uniform and focussed direction. This strategy has been intentionally developed to
allow maximum flexibility to the planning process to ensure that innovative solutions are developed in order
to provide the most combat-capable force, fully compatible with NATO, that can be maintained within the
resources provided by the state. Although serious in its intent to meet its security responsibilities in the
present, the reality underlying this document is a recognition that well-reasoned risks must be accepted in
the current environment of relative peace and stability in order to resource and build SR Force 2010, a
thoroughly professional and modern force for the future.

This Military Strategy will be updated and amended as required to account for changes to the security
environment, the vital interests of Slovakia, and the resources available for its defense.

**Approved by the National Council of the Slovak Republic on October 25th 2001.**
