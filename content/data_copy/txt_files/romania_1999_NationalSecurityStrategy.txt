**ROMANIA's NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY**

**Introduction**

The Romanian Law states that Romania’s National Security Strategy is “the basic document that
substantiates national defence planning”. The Strategy is therefore the political illustration of
the fundamental attributes of the Romanian state in this field.

The strategy synthesizes objectives, makes clear definitions, and correlates policy actions for all
the entities engaged in ensuring the security of the country, in order to substantiate, in a
unitary and coherent way, the actions and the specific regulations of the state institutions of the
rule of law and the constitutional power wielders responsible for implementing, safeguarding
and asserting Romania’s fundamental interests.

The structure of the Security Strategy has been established in the Law on Romania’s National
Defence Planning and comprises, in sequential order, the following:

1. Defining the national security interests;
2. Outlining the objectives that contribute to safeguarding and asserting these interests;
3. Assessing the international security environment;
4. Identifying the risk factors within the domestic and international environment;
5. Courses of action and means for ensuring Romania’s national security.

Issued, therefore, in full accordance with the provisions of the relevant law, the present Security
Strategy ensures the continuity conferred by law in making a successive approach, by previous
similar documents, to Romanian’s security. In this way, the experience gathered during the last
few years has been taken into account and has ensured the necessary coherence with the
previously adopted programmes for Romania’s integration into the North-Atlantic Alliance and
into the European Union.

At the same time, the present Security Strategy is deeply marked by current developments, by
the realities of the Romanian society and throughout the world, as well as by short – and
medium – term foreseeable perspectives of domestic and international life.
In this respect, the novelty of the National Security Strategy is a wider opening to these issues
and a wider approach to the concept of national security, in the circumstances of the increasing
complexity and diversity of the aspects that have become relevant in this area.

Institutional and specialists’ analyses that have substantiated the charting of the strategy have
led to the conclusion that such a renewed and novel approach to the security issues is a
necessity as well as a possibility.

a) In terms of the need for a fresh approach, it can be noticed that the dynamics of phenomena
within the country’s economic and social reality, as well as the mutations, often unexpected,
occurring throughout the world require from our own Security Strategy a greater perception,
evaluation and approach to all these phenomena and changes, so that the responses and
reactions of the national security system shall always be adequate to realities and, at the same
time, permanently subordinated to the fundamental interests of the country.


-----

Internally, Romania’s security status today is still characterized by quite enough vulnerabilities
in almost all areas of the social and economic environment, as well as in the natural
environment of the Romanian society’s existence. This situation is the direct result of the
cumulative pressure, over time, of a number of multiple factors – political, economic, financial,
social, cultural, biological, religious, demographic, military, and of different kinds – which have
influenced the safe environment of the state and citizens, leading to the weakening of the
moral, material standing, as well as that of spiritual values, on which the civilization of our
national identity is based.

Internationally, the world has been going through an unprecedented situation, being deeply
marked by the irrational acts of forces pursuing terrorism as means of dividing the international
community and weakening world stability.

The global character of the fight against terrorism has become the necessary component,
however unexpected and the least wanted, of globalization, already turning itself into a
commandment of fight and of attitude for all democracies to which the Romanian state has
unwaveringly associated itself.

The enlargement of the spectrum of unconventional risks, the diversification of the types of
crises and conflicts have been generating multiple challenges that require multi-directional
reactions, based on mobility, diversity, coherence and complementarity both domestically and
internationally.

b) The wider approach to the issues of security has become also possible under the present
circumstances by identifying some new domestic security resources, that have resulted from the
careful correlation and turning into account of all the factors – political, economic, financial,
military, civic, social, ecological – of the national safety and security.

Therefore, besides the elements of continuity and tradition in the security field, the
characteristics of the new strategy of national security is that Romania no longer approaches its
own model of security through a strictly technical vision of the security issues, in an inflexible
manner, which includes a rigid organization and a hermetic attitude of the institutions and
competences in this field.

The fundamental responsibility for the country’s security rests, of course, with the President of
the country, Parliament, the Government, the other state institutions – according to each one’s
constitutional responsibilities. However, the complexity of the aspects that influence this area
makes it necessary that within the system of national security – that represents the instrument
by which the Security Strategy becomes operational – there should be attracted civil, nongovernmental, academic and commercial structures that possess technologies and information
related to national security and can contribute to the formation and balance of the internal
environment – economic, social, civil and military.

This concept can be also found in the way of specifically regulating various economic-social
areas, in the manner of managing public resources earmaked for security, in increasing the
degree of institutional cooperation and coordination of the efforts aimed at building social and
national solidarity. In this way, the Romanian community as a whole and all the country's
citizens will not only have the right ensured to benefit from protection in multiple ways, but they
will also get the possibility and obligation to participate in ensuring it.

Reshaping the relations between the specific components of security, as well as the
understanding of the processes in the world and European security requires the Romanian state
to readjust its own strategy according to the developments of the security environment by
integrating it in a wider systemic vision, in order to augment the capability of countering the
risks and threats that can affect Romania's interests.


-----

The System of National Security defines the assembly of means, regulations and institutions of
the Romanian state that play a part in achieving, safeguarding, and asserting Romania’s
fundamental interests.

The Strategy represents the basic document that defines these interests, as well as the
objectives for their achievement, and materializes the political expression and highest level
settlement of the Romanian State, and at the same time, the instrument for substantiating and
directing the actions within the whole system of national security.

The Strategy has horizon of evaluation over medium term comprising the predictable elements
– at the moment – which influence the achievement of the goals of Romania’s national security.

**1. Romania’s National Security Interests**

Romania’s national interests represent those states and processes, based on the values
assumed and pursued by the Romanian society, by which it ensures the prosperity, protection
and safety of its members and the stability and continuity of the state.

Building a democratic Romania, politically stable and economically and socially prosperous,
capable of efficiently taking part in the dynamics of international life makes it necessary that in
full agreement with the development of the process of European and Euro-Atlantic integration,
the following national interests should be asserted, achieved and safeguarded:

-  The maintenance of the integrity, unity, sovereignty and independence of the Romanian
state;

-  Guaranteeing the fundamental and democratic freedoms, and ensuring the welfare,
security and safety of Romania’s citizens;

-  The economic and social development of the country, in keeping up with the
contemporary development in the world. Intense reduction of the wide gaps separating
Romania from the developed European countries;

-  Meeting the conditions for Romania’s integration as a NATO and EU member. Romania
must become a component with full obligations and rights of the two organizations, the
only ones capable of guaranteeing its independence and sovereignty and enable an
economic, political and social development similar to that of the democratic countries;

-  Asserting the national identity and pursuing it as a democratic value, making best use
of and developing the national cultural heritage and the creative abilities of the
Romanian people;

-  Protection of the environment, natural resources, the quality of the environmental
factors at international standards.

In the pursuit of its national interests, Romania will follow the principles of international law, will
develop the dialogue and cooperation with all international organizations and states interested
in achieving stability and security.

**2. National Security Policy Goals**

Romania’s national security goals articulate the effective orientation and represent the basic
landmarks of the practical, sectorial action of the various state institutions so that their
coherent, correlated and interdependent realization shoul contribute to the accomplishment and
assertion of the fundamental interests of the country.


-----

The National Security Strategy sets the following objectives:

-  maintaining the independence, sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity of Romania,
under the specific conditions of NATO membership and EU integration;

-  guaranteeing the constitutional order, the building of the rule of law and the democratic
functions of the Romanian society by means of: safeguarding the democratic freedoms
of citizens, the constitutional rights and obligations, and equality of opportunities;
improving the political system and developing the means for ensuring social solidarity;
deepening justice reform; consolidating the authority of state institutions and building
up the law enforcement mechanisms;

-  reviving the national economic recovery, overcoming poverty and unemployment;
streamlining the mechanisms of market economy and the financial discipline;

-  developing the civil society and the middle class;

-  ensuring the stability of financial banking system and social balance;

-  streamlining the law-enforcement agencies; protecting the safety of the citizen;

-  optimizing the national defense capability in keeping up with the NATO standards;

-  improving the capacity of participating in international operations for combating
terrorism and organized crime;

-  improving the health of the population and child care and developing the education,
research and cultural institutions;

-  reforming the public administration and regional development in agreement with the
European practice and provisions;

-  harmonizing inter-ethnic relations and building up the civic multicultural state, based on
the guarantees of security, social participation, intercultural integration and the
principle of subsidiarity in the governing act;

-  diplomatic actions moves and a creative dynamic and pragmatic foreign policy, based
on the observance of the international treaties and international agreements to which
Romania is a signatory, as well as respect for the goals and principles of the UN
charter;

-  diversifying and strengthening ties with Romanians living outside the national borders;

-  active participation in actions of international cooperation aimed at fighting terrorism
and cross-border organized crime;

-  developing the good-neighborly relations and participative conduct at the regional level,
for building up stability and resolving crises;

-  ensuring environmental security;

-  the engagement of the civil society in carrying out the objectives of the security
strategy.

The realization of these objectives will contribute to the social modernization of the Romanian
society and speed up the resolution of the major problems it has to face. It will also implement
and protect national interests, and ensure the national security of the country and its citizens.

**3. The International Security Environment**

The onset of the XXI-century has been marked by profound changes of the security
environment. The world has become ever more complex and interdependent, and globalization
has asserted itself as an irreversible process.
**_3.1. An Active Adjustable Organizational Framework_**
The generally positive evolution of the global security for the last century has validated that the
success of actions and stability can only stem from multidimensional cooperation of the
international community – above all, by making best use of the dialogue within the
institutionalized framework and by instigating the decisive role that international organizations
play in defining the world’s security status.

In a changing international context, NATO plays an essential role in strengthening the Euro

-----

Atlantic security after the end of the “cold war”. Its political role is in ascendancy, particularly
after the adoption at the 1999 Washington Summit of a new Strategic Concept of the Alliance;
relying on a substantially enhanced negotiating power for the last decade, NATO has initiated
and developed the political-military partnership, consolidated cooperation and dialogue with
other states – including Romania; has shown continuing interest and receptiveness, just
reaffirmed very recently by receiving new members and also by collaborating with other
international organizations; the commitment, materialized in the Balkans, for the prevention of
conflicts and crisis management, including by means of peace keeping operations. All these
have proved the determination of the North Atlantic Alliance to shape the inteernational security
environment and cement peace and stability in the Euro-Atlantic area.

UNO, OSCE and EU have brought particular contributions to Euro-Atlantic security and stability.
The UN Security Council will continue to have a widely-recognized responsibility in keeping
peace and international stability, and will continue to play an important part in the coming years
in building world security and stability, something confirmed symbolically by the awarding, in
2001, of the Nobel Peace Prize to the UN and its Secretary General.

The OSCE, which represents the most inclusive regional security institution in Europe, that also
includes Canada and the US, plays a paramount role in pursuing peace and stability, in
strengthening security through cooperation and the pursuit of democracy and human rights
throughout the northern hemisphere of our planet. The OSCE has been active particularly in the
areas of diplomacy, conflict prevention, crisis management and post-conflict rehabilitation.

The EU has made major decisions and has given a fresh impetus to the efforts for building
security and the defence component.

Developing a joint foreign and security policy entails the progressive definition of a joint defence
policy. Such a policy, envisaged by the Amsterdam Treaty, has to be compatible with the joint
security and defence policy set through the Treaty of Washington.

At the same time, the EU is ever more concerned with carrying out its own internal institutional
reforms, as well as with the effectiveness of the ensuing debate concerning the future of Europe
and the political construction on the continent.
**_3.2. Towards new forms of solidarity._**

The challenges induced by globalization, its overlapping with the centrifugal tendencies of
regionalization and fragmentation generate new tensions and risk factors.

The continuous multiplication of the number of entities acting in the global arena through the
assertion of non-state actors leads to an increase in the complexity of the decision-making
process in the foreign and security policies of states. These challenges have to be answered by
new forms of solidarity, capable of managing a wide range of tensions and risks as well as a
large array of their manifestations, such as: ethnic-related tensions, drugs, radioactive
substances and human beings trafficking, organized crime, political instability in some areas, redivision of some zones of influence.

The big gaps in the level of economic development – which have been continuously growing in
the context of unprecedented technological progresses – the discriminatory access to education
and healthcare, to essential life resources, to information and knowledge cause serious social
crises, generate frustrations and discontent. In the circumstances of the economic globalization,
social crises are occasionally accompanied by identity crises that generate unexpected violence.

In this context, it is becoming ever more obvious that the security interests and goals of the
states can only be achieved through international cooperation, which should unfold not only in
critical circumstances like the one created by the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on USA,
but also within the problems-generating context – economic, social, financial – of today’s
woorld.


-----

This new togetherness of the world can be expressed in all these fields, through the formulation
of new joint forms of action by all the nations sharing the same interests and values.

The terrorist attacks on the United States of America, as well as the ensuing threats, underscore
more so – however in tragic circumstances – the need for such new forms of international
solidarity which would allow not only the prevention and countering of such actions, but also the
development of appropriate ways for building political, economic and social stability all over the
world.

Terrorism, however, represents one of the most dangerous phenomena, being encouraged by
the virulence of fundamentalist trends, based on frustration and extreme poverty in large areas
of the planet. By being so unpredictable, by defying the norms and reason of the civilized life
and by its emotional impact on public opinion, terrorism can generate responses capable of
destabilizing the international community, and driving manking into isolation, suspicion, and
unilateral solutions. The virulent defiance of terrorism – as well as the other challenges or nonmilitary risks of the present-day world – will only be eliminated through open, multilateral,
balanced and persistent cooperation, aimed at eradicating its roots and deep causes –
particularly extreme poverty.

**_3.3. Europe is undergoing continuous change._**

The security interests and goals of the European states, however, do not generate conflicting
states, with the security environment being positively influenced by the European and EuroAtlantic integration processes, by the extension of the community of states sharing and
promoting the values of democracy and market economy, and by deepening regional
cooperation.

The risks of the emergence of a traditional military confrontation on the European continent
have seriously diminished. Nevertheless, there are still occurrences of instability and crises at
the sub-regional level and tendencies of fragmentation, marginalization or isolation of some
states. Countries in Central, Eastern and South-East Europe are being confronted with
economic, social and political difficulties accompanying the process of transition to a society
based on the principles of democracy and market economy, which can generate risks for the
security of the states in the area.

The European Union is currently undergoing a deep process of internal reform, concomitantly
with the ongoing process of taking in new members. The progresses made in pursuing a joint
foreign and security policy, the solutions chosen and the involvement of the international and
European organizations for solving difficult situations on the continent, prove that Europe is
preparing to assume a more substantial role in the architecture of its own security, including
defense, and provide models of setting the relations between states and nations on a rational
and fair basis, by harmonizing their interests.

For Romania, meeting the Community criteria of accession is a requisite process, first of all from
a domestic, economic and social point of view, with obvious direct effects on our national
security, too. And this is because fulfilling the National Plan for EU Accession will have an impact
firstly on Romania, will speed up its economic development, will deepen and strengthen its
democracy, will enhance tolerance and dialogue, will build up the exercise of the fundamental
rights and freedoms, the protection of minorities and their ethnic and cultural identity, will
speed up the solving of problems through dialogue and joint actions.

Parallel to its efforts to meet the Accession criteria, Romania needs to take the responsibility for
developing a Romanian point of view, its own vision about the future of Europe. This will be a
necessary contribution not only to the general debate which is currently taking place on the
same issue in most European countries, but also to build the concept of national security in the
circumstances of the new architecture of the continent.


-----

**_3.4. Democracy is an important resource of the domestic security environment._**

After December 1989, Romania has crossed a difficult stage, as it has had to develop the “rule
of law”, the democratic institutions and mechanisms, the reforms necessary to shift from the
“command” ecoonomy to the market one.

However, finalizing these historical, irreversible processes involves costly efforts. But, in spite of
the shortcomings and failures, some of which still persist, the results thus far are essential –
inclusively for the security of the country – and refer to the fact that the Romanian society is
organized and operates on the basis of the fundamental democratic principles, values and
freedoms.

This is an important and uncontestable thing in any characterization of today’s Romania. The
acceptance of political pluralism, political, ideological and cultural differences, ethnic diversity,
respect for human rights, which shape the activity of the “rule of law” state institutions in
eliminating any forms of marginalization on ethnic, religious, social, sexual or political
orientation criteria, the uncontestable political stability and the example-setting experience of
the peaceful, democratic alternatives to power – all these are realities of the Romanian
democratic society, as well as valuable resources for solving the problems of the country, and
tackling the national security on more solid and efficient grounds.

**_3.5. The main security problems of Romania are those of economic nature._**

The difficulties of the prolonged economic transition, the decrease in the quality of life, the
social disparities, the increase in the number of those living under the poverty threshold – all
these can result in intolerance, affect social solidarity, fuel populism, feed up radical and
extremist manifestations, with the most serious effects on the institutions and mechanisms of
the state.

The Romanian society is still marked by the consequences of the faulty management of the
economic and social transition process, which has led to the diminished authority and efficiency
of state institutions and affected civic cohesion and social balance. The positive result of the
reforms, still not convincing enough, have caused a gradual decrease of the resources allocated
for the modernization of the society and decreased the hope of the citizens, which have been
faced with rising poverty. We have witnessed a decline in the living standard of most of the
people, including from the point of view of health, education and environment protection.

Public services are too bureaucratic, the territorial infrastructure is not sufficiently developed,
the restructuring and modernization of industry are confronted with serious difficulties, farming
has experienced a dramatic decline, privatization and normalization of the owners’ rights still
face much inertia, healthcare is precarious, the transportation and communication network is
poorly developed.

At the same time, the slow adjustment of the public law and order and national security system
to the new, ever more aggressive forms of criminality, as well as some deficiencies in the
management of the justice system have caused an unacceptable decrease in the citizens’ safety.

Based on the experience we have accumulated, it is necessary that we identify and eliminate
the blockages, and implement immediately the solutions, which enable a real economic
recovery. We need a coherent approach, which should unite the energies of the society, channel
its resources to build a performing economy, capable of eliminating the feeling of uncertainty
and insecurity at the social level.


-----

Reviving the economic recovery must be strengthened through the creation of an attractive and
stable business environment, and connecting it appropriately to the important economicfinancial, technological and commercial inflows. Speeding-up economic growth refers firstly to
the insurance of the prosperity of the citizens and the support of the domestic democratic
process.

The increased citizen trust in state institutions is possible only under the conditions of steadily
promoting the principles of the rule of law and the fundamental rights of the citizens.

The difficulties facing Romania are also problems confronting other areas of Europe and make
the subject of wider international concern. Maintaining an unstable climate in the sub-regional
plan, with a negative impact on the economic environment, has deepended Romania's inability
to make decision capable to get it closer to the economic-financial system characteristic of the
Western democratic world. In the effort to promote economic reform, forms of connecting it to
the economic and financial structures of the Western economic system have materialized quite
difficult and randomly. The crisis and violence in the neighborhood countries have led to a loss
of traditional economic relations, caused important financial losses to Romania, prevented the
development and promotion of some long-term development strategies, represented an
obstacle to encouraging foreign investors, and generally speaking, have deepened its
difficulties.

Meeting the obligations assumed by Romania in the process of integration into the European
and Euro-Atlantic structures represents a decisive stage in modernizing the Romanian society
and consolidating the trends of economic growth. Over long term, these will generate prosperity
and increase Romania's credibility in its efforts to consolidate the European security.

Consequently, it is not the fear of threats but the wish to secure stability and build a better
future, strengthen the vocation of a pillar of stability in the area and be a defender of the
democracy and peace values which motivate Romania’s options for European and Euro-Atlantic
integration.

**4. Risk Factors to the Security of Romania**

The risk factors represent those elements, situations or conditions, either domestic or external,
which might affect the security of the country, generating adverse effects or affecting the
fundamental national interests.

Vulnerabilities are defined as states of things, processes or phenomena in the domestic life,
which diminish the capability of response to existing or potential risks or favour their emergence
or development.

Romania is not confronted and will not be, in the near future, with major threats of classic
military types, against its national security. It is estimated that, in the current period, the risks
to its security are mainly non-military, especially of a domestic type. They appear particularly in
the economic, financial, social and environmental fields. However, the continuity and
conjugation of existing vulnerabilities in these fields may affect the security of the country,
causing inter-dependent, diffuse, multi-directional effects, which require appropriate and flexible
ways of prevention and action. Neglecting those vulnerabilities, letting them amplify may create
instability and lead to their becoming risks to the national security.


-----

**_4.1. Under the umbrella of the international climate._**

The clear separation of the developments in the domestic and international environment is more
and more difficult to be made, in the context of the synergetic action and interlocking of some
processes which can create favourable conditions to the emergence, either predictable or not, of
some risks to the national security. The deepening of the multiple inter-dependencies between
states, the globalization and liberalization of the exchanges of any kind – ranging from the
commercial to the informational ones – make such a separation ever more difficult in a
globalized environment, where domestic and foreign risks can generate and enhance each
other.

Nevertheless, the background of the dynamics of these interdependencies is a positive one,
being made up, on one had, of the generalization, at the European level, of the spirit of
cooperation and dialogue, for the strengthening of the security on the continent. On the other
hand, it is also made up of the ever more active involvement of the UNO, NATO, EU, OSCE and
other European institutions of international organizations in managing the complex problems of
global security and stability.

These main characteristics of the international climate represent, for the Romanian state,
circumstances of utmost importance, which have the role of favouring and encouraging the
speeding-up and finalization of the domestic reform processes, so necessary for meeting the
criteria of European and Euro-Atlantic integration.

Against this background, the fundamental responsibility of the state is particularly to
authoritatively manage the risks and vulnerabilities of a strictly domestic nature, which
inevitably influence Romania’s position in the international security environment. Through the
attention it pays to these domestic factors, Romania can, on one hand, still be an important
provider of regional and international security and, on the other hand, turn the fulfillment of the
objectives of sustained, durable, economic, social development into a valuable and specific
resource for the country’s real security.

**_4.2. The main foreign risk factors to the national security are:_**

-  possible negative developments at the sub-regional level, in the area of
democratization, human rights and economic development, which might result in
serious crises, with destabilizing effects over a large area;

-  proliferation of mass destruction weapons, nuclear materials and technologies, nonconventional arms and lethal devices;

-  proliferation and development of terrorist networks, transnational organized crime,
illegal trafficking in people, drugs, arms and ammunition, strategic and radioactive
materials;

-  clandestine migration and the emergence of some massive flows of refugees;

-  actions inciting extremism, intolerance, separatism and xenophobia that might affect
Romania and the advancement of democratic values;

-  gaps between the levels of enforcing security and the stability of the states in the
proximity of Romania;

-  limited access of the Romanian state to some regional resources and opportunities that
are important for the attainment of the national interests.

**_4.3. New challenges._**

A new category of risks are the non-classical asymmetric ones, which may consist of deliberate
armed and non-armed actions aimed at affecting national security by causing direct or indirect
consequences on the country’s economic and social life. Among the threats of that type, the
following ones can be mentioned:


-----

-  transnational and international political terrorism, including its biological and cyber
forms;

-  acts infringing upon the safety of domestic and international transportation networks;

-  individual or group actions targeting illegal access to computer systems;

-  activities aimed at deliberately affecting – under various forms and circumstances –
Romania’s image internationally, with effects on her credibility and reliability in
complying with the commitments which Romania has undertaken;

-  economic-financial attacks;

-  deliberate provocation of environment catastrophes.

Among the afore-mentioned ones, international terrorism is manifest in an unprecedented acute
form envisioning multiple effects on state security and international stability – as a whole.

To the extent in which international terrorism is perceived increasingly complex and
unpredictable, the domestic measures of crisis management shall have to be better coordinated
in order to meet the requirement for our country’s operational and effective participation in the
international efforts to counter such a threat.

Romania reasserts its willingness to participate, alongside the international community, in the
fight against international terrorism and it will permanently decide on the most appropriate
means to counter it.

**_4.4. Flaws in the domestic situation._**

Concomitantly with preventing or focally countering the intervention of such possible risk
factors, Romania is concerned with reducing the domestic flaws in various fields which, under
particular circumstances, may impact on national security.

Among such types of vulnerabilities, the following are to be mentioned:

-  prevailing economic, financial, and social problems generated by prolonged transition
and delayed structural reforms;
increased corruption and mismanagement of public resources, resulting in deeper social
inequities and underground economy proliferation;

-  inefficient responses of the state institutions to the acute stage reached by economic
crime and the disturbance of public order and citizen safety – such phenomena entailing
ever more obvious negative effects on social cohesion and solidarity, on the citizen’s
standard of life;

-  maintenance of some sources and causes for particular potential social conflicts, of
smaller or greater extend, leading to dissipating the energies, slowing down or cutting
the processes and actual economic activities, as well as the people’s peace of mind;

-  non-observance of the environmental norms in the functioning of some industrial
facilities; the likelihood for some ecological disasters, natural catastrophes and
environment degrading process to occur;

-  lower reliability of the citizens in the state istitutions, as a result of indolence and
excessive bureaucracy within the administration, which also leads to weakened social
and civic cohesion;

-  maintenance of some disparities in the development of the country’s regions;

-  shortcomings in complying with the commitments that have been undertaken for NATO
accession;

-  maintenance of information technology at a lower level and delaying its upgrading to
the standards demanded by the dynamics of globalization;

-  irregularities in the protection of classified information;

-  migration of specialists from various high technology domains, a phenomenon that
affects the development potential of Romanian society.

**5. Directions of Action in the National Security Policy**

**_5.1. In the political-administrative realm:_**

Modernization of the Romanian society requires firm action in order to strengthen the regulating
function of the state and the authority of its institutions. The implementation of the national
security goals requires the development of the normative capability of the Romanian state, by
democratically adopted measures in observance of the principle of the separation of powers and
ensuring institutional and administrative reform. The State, as an organizer of national and
social cohesion, needs to become a flexible and efficient, de-bureaucratized institution, placed in
the service of the citizens.

The whole political system is to be improved so that it may open itself to the citizens and add
the participative democracy virtues to the representative democracy; consequently, exercising
political power will ensure citizen participation in and the control of the institutions and the
decision-making process, by observing the democratic rules and norms in accordance with the
provisions of the Constitution.

The law-making process has to take into account a unitary and coherent concept to be fully
compatible with the European legislation, with the Acquis Communantaire principles, with the
regulating system peculiar to the European Union.

The strict and robust law enforcement in relation to every citizen and under any circumstances –
in the spirit and the letter of the law – constitutes a major requirement for all the state
institutions, the meeting of which decisively impinges upon social cohesion, citizen reliability in
the public authorities, and national solidarity. That is the reason why the ensuring of fairness in
the administrative and judicial activities, legislative stability and simplified legal framework, the
assertion of judiciary as an institution of honesty and professionalism are highly required. Also,
it is necessary for the legal framework to be more explicitly adjusted to the requirements of
countering terrorism and organized crime, as well as to those deriving from the need for the
forces within the defence system to participate in joint operations and assignments, alongside
the forces belonging to other states, both on the national territory and abroad.

The Supreme Defense Council of the Country will improve its coordination activities, enshrined
in the Constitution and the special legislation, in the areas of national defense, law enforcement
and national security.

**_5.2. In the economic realm:_**

The transition to a functional market economy requires a well-coordinated joint effort towards
reaching the goals undertaken by Romania in the Long-Term Development Strategy, which was
accepted by the European Union, alongside with measures for optimizing the regulating
framework in the field.

Economic relaunch is a priority of the security policy.

Directions of action in the field are:

-  consolidation of macro-economic stability, the adoption of some coherent fiscal policies
through simplified and stimulating regulation, the reformation of taxes, the reduction of
domestic expenses and restructuring of the big state-owned companies and firms, an
appropriate exchange rate and monetary policy;

-  improvement of the business environment, diminished “red tape”, favourizing
regulation for investments and for maintaining economic growth through high
performance production, as demanded by market;

-  stimulation, through various and effective forms of regulation, of the small – and
medium – sized enterprises;


-----

-  continuation of privatization, restructuring, and modernization, while focusing on more
dynamic, high potential industrial and productive fields in line with the requirements of
the sectorial plans for EU accession or the ones agreed upon with the international
financial organizations;

-  advancement of some functional industrial policies, in keeping with the social needs and
easily adjustable to the market demands;

-  development of international economic cooperation through new, more active and
stimulating forms of foreign trade;

-  consolidation of the banking and insurance sector; more disciplined capital markets
which involve wide layers of the population;

-  jump-start of agriculture and development of forestry;

-  territorial planning and development, and rehabilitation of transport infrastructure;

-  advancement of new and efficient technologies, and turning to the actual
implementation of the digital society;

-  development of tourism and consolidation of the institutional and legislative framework
with respect to the environment and its quality;

-  orientation to attracting foreign investments, primarily from the European and EuroAtlantic space, as a motivation source for Romania’s integration in the respective
security systems;

-  development of home trade activities, inclusively through regulation within local public
administration on stimulating production and local markets;

-  ensuring consumer protection;

-  guarantees for a free and fair competitive system.

**_5.3. In the social realm:_**

The social security problems refer, among others, to the state of personal insecurity,
demographic decline and people’s health, emigration of the educated and highly-skilled youth,
insufficient assertion along all its components of the civil society, and the absence of a strong
middle class. The policy in the social security domain aims at all those aspects, focusing on
fighting poverty, consolidating dialogue and social solidarity, and aligning with the European
norms in the employment field.

The main social phenomena that alter the cohesion of Romanian society and makes it even
more vulnerable to social crises and conflicts are caused by negative developments at the
macro-economic level and an incoherent legal framework.

In this respect, the Strategy ascertains the need for the implementation of some means to
stimulate national solidarity and civic responsibility, an interest in labour, equality between men
and women, equal opportunities for access to education and training and social protection.

Consequently, all the efforts made by the institutions with competence in the field will focus on:

-  advancement of dialogue and social cohesion with the involvement of the state, as a
balancing factor in thwarting the negative effects of the transition process and the
market economy developments;

-  reformation of the social security system and reducing the deficit in financing social
protection;

-  formulation, together with the social partners, of the National Plan of Action in the
employment field, capable of ensuring coherence to all the activities on the labour
market;

-  decentralization of the administrative decision in the labour relationship domain;

-  employment in keeping with the EU directions, cuts in unemployment and the ensuring
of genuine social protection for the unemployed, inclusively by attracting and involving
them in useful public activities to be carried out while they are dismissed;

-  establishing some salary policies in keeping with the performance and importance of the
field;


-----

-  implementation of pension reform with a view to diversifying the insurance resources,
eliminating inequities, and increasing pensions in real terms;

-  improvement of the social security system;

-  improving the people’s health, encouraging and regulating the home manufacture of
basic medicine;

-  ensuring child protection – as a national priority – and regulating the adoption system
in keeping with the UN Convention Implementation Strategy;

-  supporting and strengthening the family, as the primary social entity;

-  improving the living conditions of individuals and families deprived of incomes or with
low incomes, preventing and countering social outcasting, alleviating poverty through
increased employment of the working population;

-  development of good citizenship, social solidarity, and inter-cultural dialogue.

**_5.4. In the realm of education, research, and culture:_**

The basic problems in this field – which could be termed as belonging to the cultural security, in
a broader sense – are directly linked to the need of asserting new mentalities and attitudes,
capable of contributing to the reshapement of the cultural and civilizing dimension of reforms,
implicitly required by the process of the European and Euro-Atlantic integration. The community
spirit, the national solidarity, the communication culture, the attitude towards performance, the
respect for elites and their promotion are still insufficienty developed.

That is the reason why valuing and developing Romania’s cultural, scientific, and human
potential represent an essential component and resource of the national security and the
modernization of the Romanian society.

The main action directions in this domain are:

-  advancement of the educational society in cooperation with civil society and in keeping
with the White Paper of Education and Training, which has been worked out by the
European Union;

-  continuation of the education system reform, as a groundwork for the policies in the
human resources field;

-  ensuring basic education, and increased quality in postgraduate education;

-  alignment of higher education with the social and economic requirements;

-  advancement of the information society requirements within the educational system;

-  improvement of the legal and institutional framework for research-development;

actually contribute to the modernization of the Romanian society;

-  development and advancement of information technology, and increased number of
specialists in this field;

-  protection, preservation, and restoration of the national heritage, and its advancement
as part of the world cultural heritage;

-  advancement of culture, as a groundwork for the nation’s development and a nucleus of
national identity;

-  protection of cultural and religious diversity, advancement of various cults and
confessions, of the dialogue with the representatives of religious life;

-  revitalization of the policies on youth;

-  improvement of the legal and institutional framework in the inter-ethnic relations field,
supporting the consolidation and development of ethnic identity;

-  readiness of the population for the cultural impact of the European and Euro-Atlantic
integration.

will be fulfilled during the present legislature, as well as afterwards. The main goal is setting up,
defending and promoting the national interests.

Romania’s national security strategy reflects intentions and actions, stages and events that will
be constantly pursued, even if in a permanently changing world evolutions may occur which
might need temporary reconsiderations.

However, there is no alternative to the integration into the European and Euro-Atlantic
structures, although long lasting efforts might be needed.

The Romanian state and nation have ahead of them a historic achievement – European and
Euro-Atlantic integration. All our efforts must be directed towards achieving this unprecedented
opportunity in our long history.

A realistic vision of our possibilities and resources forces us to concentrate our efforts on those
priorities that will decisively influence Romania’s security state. The participation of its citizens
and organizations, of the whole society will be decisive for sustaining the possibilities of
developing this strategy’s objectives.

Security and prosperity are two objectives with a profund mutual determination and their
