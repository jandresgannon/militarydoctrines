# WHITE PAPER ON DEFENCE AND THE ARMED FORCES OF THE REPUBLIC OF BULGARIA

## Address of the Prime Minister of the Republic of Bulgaria

_In 2009, under the conditions of a severe economic and finan-_
_cial crisis, the political party GERB (Citizens for the European_
_Development of Bulgaria) was commissioned by the Bulgarian_
_voters to assume the responsibility of the country’s management._
_GERB’s government developed and follows a clear management_
_programme, in which the implementation of modern defence_
_policy is a priority. Initially our efforts were focused on addressing_
_a backlog of negatives. Now our main task is creating conditions_
_to build a modern defence system and Armed Forces. This means_
_leading a policy of transparency and accountability, eliminating_
_the conditions allowing corruption and inefficient management, the_
_successful functioning of the Ministry of Defence as a modern dem-_
_ocratic institution and improving the structure of the Armed Forces_
_according to contemporary realities and available resources._

_It is within the rights of every citizen to want to be comprehen-_
_sively acquainted with how nearly half a billion euros are being_
_spent every year from the taxes which he/she pays. It is natural to_
_hear many different and often divergent opinions and comments on_
_the matter. Here, my concrete message is a short one: At the current_
_stage of its development, our country will build its security within_
_NATO’s collective defence and through the Common Security and_
_Defence Policy of the European Union. This means ‘shared respon-_
_sibility for security’ and requires adequate use of and participation_
_in the NATO’s collective defence mechanisms. In this context, our_
_efforts will concentrate on the systematic development of defence_
_capabilities, the modernisation of our Armed Forces and their_
_effective use in the defence of our national interests._

_AM modern Bulgarian Armed Forces are, undoubtedly, an im-_
_portant building block and an indispensable tool in our national_
_security strategy. Along with diplomacy and economy, they are at_


-----

_the heart of our state’s power. In this sense, the Government of the_
_Republic of Bulgaria is in need of a public consensus and a spirit_
_of cooperation to conduct the reforms described in this White Pa-_
_per, which aim at building a modern and well-prepared Bulgarian_
_Armed Forces, a reliable and capable ally, doctrinally, organisa-_
_tionally and technologically compatible with the armies in NATO._
_Such forces can be a true shield for our national security and sov-_
_ereignty, adequately contributing to the realisation of Bulgaria’s_
_national interests._

## Foreword by the Minister of Defence of the Republic of Bulgaria

_This is the second White Paper on Defence and Armed Forces_
_of the Republic of Bulgaria in our recent history. Driven by the_
_desire to include the Bulgarian citizens in the process of reforming_
_the defence system and the building of a modern Armed Forces, we_
_initiated the preparation and issuance of this document with the_
_idea of informing and associating our efforts with the Bulgarian_
_public. With the resources allocated annually from the budget in_
_the interest of defence, each Bulgarian citizen contributes to this_
_defence policy. Concurrently, the worthy and capable among the_
_Bulgarian military and civilian personnel are numerous – men_
_and women who take on the burdensome duty to provide not only_
_knowledge, skills and experience, but to risk their wellbeing and_
_even their lives, away from home, to ensure Bulgaria’s national_
_interests and complete our commitments to Allies._

_So as to be convinced that we are presenting the best to Bulgarian_
_society for its defence and security, we conducted a Force Structure_
_Review. Within this review we made an in-depth assessment of_
_the challenges, risks and threats in the contemporary strategic_
_environment and of the possible scenarios in which the use of the_
_Armed Forces would be necessary to meet and neutralize them. The_
_necessary defence capabilities were evaluated in that context to_
_ensure the security and protection of the national interests defined_
_in the new National Security Strategy project. The main results of_
_the review and the consequent guidelines for political and practical_
_action are presented in this White Paper. Our ambition is to present_
_a full and hopefully clearer picture to Bulgarian society, not only_
_of the objectives and priorities of the defence policy of the Republic_
_of Bulgaria, but also of the approaches we have adopted for its_
_realisation. In other words, this document is aimed at answering_


-----

_the question of_ **_what defence we need and what we can afford._**
_We can summarise the answer as follows: development of a single_
**_set of forces balanced for all tasks, with a unified command and_**
**_control system for peacetime and during crises, with organisation,_**
**_equipment and combat training adequately corresponding to_**
**_the tasks and backed with the required financial and material_**
**_resources._**

_In security the most effective approach is prevention. We oversee_
_the daily participation of our Armed Forces in operations in_
_light of this understanding. The most beneficial return from this_
_participation is in keeping threats away from our national borders._
_Our responsibility is to provide the Armed Forces with everything_
_necessary to fulfil their tasks with dignity, in the name of the_
_prosperity and welfare of Bulgaria and its citizens._

_Bulgaria’s process of strategic rethinking in defence policy is_
_not isolated from those in the allied organisations that Bulgaria_
_is a member of. In NATO we are actively involved in drafting the_
_new Strategic Concept and in conferring on a new, more efficient,_
_economical and effective command structure. Similarly, in the_
_European Union we are seeking the mechanisms and framework_
_for the complete realisation of the Common Security and Defence_
_Policy’s potential, revealed by the Lisbon Treaty’s entering into_
_force. Our review is also responsive to these reform processes and_
_the Bulgarian contribution to them._

_With this White Paper we are laying the foundation for the_
_Bulgarian Armed Forces’ long-term development planning and_
_for the formulation of an effective national defence strategy. I am_
_convinced that by it we will make our significant contribution for_
_the implementation of the Government’s programme for a European_
_Development of Bulgaria._

**_Anyu Angelov,_**

_Minister of Defence of the Republic of Bulgaria_

**INTRODUCTION**

For a second time the Bulgarian public has the opportunity to open
a White Paper on Defence and Armed Forces.

The first White Paper was published in 2002, more or less along
with the first Defence Strategy of the Republic of Bulgaria. Both
the White Paper and the Defence Strategy were devoted to military
reform, interoperability and preparation in completing the strategic
objective – NATO membership. Bulgaria has been a member of NATO
for six years now and an EU member for three. During that period the
Ministry of Defence and the Armed Forces played an important role
in the establishment of trustworthy relations with allies and partners,
in the creation of favourable conditions for interoperability, and in
fulfilling the necessary political and technical-military prerequisites
for full NATO membership. That strategic objective was achieved.

However, we cannot but note that despite the huge efforts, the
unprecedented cutbacks and the concequences born by people
working in defence and the Armed Forces, the principal objectives
set in the first White Paper were not achieved. The Bulgarian Army’s
organisation-building and modernisation plans were not developed
with optimal consideration to the state’s ability to guarantee the
resources necessary for their practical implementation. Many
decisions were taken without deep analysis, justifiability and
secured resources. The combination of aspirational strategic thinking,
fluctuating political will, underprepared professionalisation of the
Armed Forces and arbitrary self-interested decisions for purchasing
new equipment, meant that the Armed Forces’ gradual process of
building-up capabilities[1] to a large extent never took place.

1 A capability is the ability to implement the action / action to achieve a specific
purpose / purposes or desired end result, under certain conditions and in accordance with
accepted standards. Military capability is a combination of the following elements: doc-
trine and concepts, organisational structure, training, material, personnel, command and
control, infrastructure and interoperability. Each item can have more than one resolution
and any resolution may be provided by more than one structural element.


-----

Concurrently, the global financiаl and economic crisis turned out
to have its greatest impact on the second half of last year and 2010.
Naturally, it was unavoidable for this fact to affect the state of Defence
and the Armed Forces. The sum of the Ministry’s massive obligations,
by previous governments, to foreign and Bulgarian companies for the
production and/or delivery of armaments, technology and services; a
standardised practice of negating the principles of good governance
and transparency; the undermining of establilshed methods of
planning; the admittance of serious violations of budgetary procedure
in the past years; and the unprecedented initial decrease in the relative
share of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for defence – these issues
could not but put the Ministry of Defence and the Armed Forces in an
exceptionally strenuous situation.

In addition, the evaluations and deductions of risks and threats
pertaining to Bulgaria show that defence retains it’s importance
as a factor. The strategic environment will continue to progress. It
will be influenced by dynamic and tough-to-predict political, social,
technological and military developments. Conflicts will be evermore
complex, unpredictable and hard to manage. Accordingly, it is
necessary to review and develop the policy, organisation, operational
concepts and, most of all, the capabilities of the Armed Forces and
their command structure.

All of this calls for new executive decisions from the Bulgarian
government in the field of defence policy, responsive to the current
strategic environment. The determining of these decisions was the
principal goal and fundamental theme in the Armed Forces structural
review.


-----

**1. SECURITY AND STRATEGIC ENVIRONMENT**

The progresses of globalisation are accelerating and with them
their direct and indefinite effect on the security environemnt.
Globalisation is of essential importance in defining the role and place
of the military factor in international, regional and national security.
An important aspect in the creation of a more predictable international
security environment is the development of strategic dialogues and
partnerships. A significant influence in shaping the global security
environment is formed from the transatlantic cooperation of NATO
and the European Union and both organisations’ partnerships with
non-member countries, for the stabilisation and reestablishment of
normal conditions in volatile crisis regions.

The European and Euro-Atlantic community of democratic states
is instrumental in the resolution of crucial international matters –
post-conflict rebuilding in crisis regions; fighting organised crime;
energy security and diversification; the neutralisation of risks to the
natural environment, to health and other. Accordingly, developments
on the European continent are of essential importance to the security
of the Republic of Bulgaria, namely progress in entrenching legal
cooperation and rule of law; in strengthening the Euro-Atlantic
dialogue; and in active partneship, including with countries outside
Europe, in the spheres of defence, national security and protection of
human rights.

As a result of these and other positive developments in international
relations, the probability of large-scale conflict between sovereign
**states has been significantly reduced. The probability of the**
Republic of Bulgaria being drawn into such a conflict, as a member
of NATO and the EU, is negligible.

In the contemporary security environment, the events on one side
of the world quickly refelect on another. This is also true for events
in world politics and economics of a negative character. The latter
spread fast, undermine the wholesome national progress, defence
and security, and propagate instability. It is therefore necessary


-----

to develop capabilities to react to sudden and unanticipated crisis
situations.

The hasards that led to the classical, typical for the 20[th] Century
large-scale military conflics, have been replaced by essentially new
risks and threats. Their characteristics – the manner in which they
orginate, develop and affect – are such that their timely detection
and prevention is significantly harder and more intricate. The risks
and threats of the 21[st] century are distinguised by an irregular, often
unconventional character. They are generally presented by states
dissociating from the international legal order or failed-states with non-
state actors such as extremist groups, radical religious communities or
tribal formations, cross-border criminal or terrorist networks.

The Republic of Bulgaria organises its defence in this complex,
dynamic and tough-to-predict international context. Negative
influences on our country’s security environment arise from: the
negative effects of globalisation on security; inner-state and religious
conflicts; cross-border terrorism; the proliferation of weapons of
mass destruction and possibilities of access to radioactive materials;
cybernetic attacks; lack of energy diversitfication; crises in global
finance and economy; demographic, ecological and climate problems;
and the dangers of spreading infectious diseases.

At the regional level, the tendencies in establishing stability in
our security environment are expressed in the pursuit of European
and Euro-Atlantic intergration of Western-Balkan states, as well as
the expansion of bilateral and regional cooperation. The efforts for
the consolidation of Kosovo and the development of Bosnia and
Hersegovina as a single unified state ascribe to that context. Positive
effects to regional security also arrise from reforming the Armed
Forces aimed at reorganising them by NATO standards. In actuality,
no state in the region considers its neighbours as potential opponents.

The geostrategic situation of the Black Sea region and the dynamic
and disparate developments in the political, economic and energy
spheres therein determine its impact to our country’s security. The
cause of regional security risks is the existence of frosen conflicts,
the actions of terrorist groups, sharp ethnic and religious disputes,
high levels of organised crime, corruption and the illegal trafficking
of weapons, narcotics and humans.


-----

Nevertheless, on the whole, the Republic of Bulgaria enjoys a
relatively favourable geostrategic and regional environment, which
allows it to lead and realise steady defence policies, in the interest of
national security and our commitments to NATO and the EU.

Despite the absence of immediate military threats to Bulgaria’s
**territorial integrity, in compliance with the Constitution of the**
Republic of Bulgaria and with the provisions of the North Atlantic
Treaty, our country will continue to maintain a defence potential
adequate to the aforementioned risks and threats and to the collective
defence capabilities of NATO. The specifics of the international
security environment predefine that the threats to our national security
will be largely met beyond our state’s borders, wherever they emerge,
and above all with the participation of military forces in international
UN, NATO and EU operations and missions.


-----

**2. STRATEGIC RETHINK OF DEFENCE**

The changes in the strategic security environment; the new
definitions of risks and threats; the significant lack of balance between
capabilities planned and resources projected for their respective
development and maintenance; the ineffective management of national
defence; the negative influence of the global financial and economic
crisis on the Bulgarian economy – these realities have imposed a
**Force Structure Review on the Bulgarian Armed Forces. In this**
process, the role, missions and actualised tasks of the Armed Forces
were reviewed.

NATO and the EU are both undergoing a synonymous process
of strategic rethinking, and our efforts effectively run alongside.
NATO is developing a new Strategic Concept, which will define its
adaptation to modern challenges. The EU’s Common Security and
Defence Policy, with the Lisbon Treaty’s entry into force, gives it a
brand new dynamic.

The need for a rethink became apparent by analysing all former
plans for building and developing armed forces, and by their practical
results (or lack thereof):

      - From the many goals that were set out only the one about
decreasing the total size of the army was achieved. The objectives
for the army to be modernised, extra-mobile, more capable, and
interoperable with the armies of other NATO members were failed.
The fulfilment of the Armed Forces Force Goals[2], agreed upon with
NATO, has been delayed;

       - The forces’ parameters and the programmes for their modernisation
significantly surpassed the country’s economic capacity;

        - The spending of the defence budget was not done with the necessary

2 Force Goals represent specific tasks, which the Ministry of Defense has negotiated
jointly with our allies in NATO and undertaken to implement within relevant periods
and subject to agreed criteria. Force Goals are a key tool by which each member-state of
NATO coordinates and harmonises the level of development, capability and readiness for
actual use of Armed Forces within the collective defense.


-----

transparency and planning measures, but laced with corrupt practices
that brought a near abandoning of the technological modenisation
of the Bulgarian Army, especially regarding interoperability. This
neglect has increased the total costfor necessary maintenance and
the establishment of new capabilities to an unbearable level for the
defence budget.

In contrast, the force structure review is based on solid political
decisions and the consistency of political will. It is backed by available
resources at hand and the clear understanding that postponing
decisions on the toughest problems, as well as delaying reforms, will
progressively undermine the feasibility of the modernised forces we
need and increase the resources necessary to attain them.

The political approaches and principles set out in this White Paper,
as well as the parameters of defence capabilities defined, naturally
identify it as a conceptual Programme for the Development of the
**Armed Forces.**

The force structure review was carried out on the principle of
**_planning based on capabilities._** The application of this approach
examines the existing, the necessary and the lack of capabilites
and takes note of the obsolete ones. It allows us to formulate the
requirements necessary to secure the transition to a single set of
Armed Forces[3] able to execute a wide range of missions and tasks.
This approach in planning is responsive to the contemporary security
environment, where the concrete threats are hidden and the sole
exercise of military muscle is rarely the appropriate answer. The
aggregation of potential military objectives is rather detemined by the
consideration to security than to existing threats.

The national defence capabilities have been structured in
accordance with the core areas set out by NATO: timely forces
availability; effective intelligence services; effective reaction and
engagement; deployability and mobility; consultation, command,
control and communications; sustainability and logistics; survivability
and protecting forces. Determining our national defence capabilities
is done within the framework of NATO’s collective capabilities and
our predefined and definite participation, by article 5 of the North

3 Single set of forces - These are forces that are deployed in a single state for peacetime
and in crisis, prepared by uniform programmes, use unified operating procedures and
uniform methods and doctrines.


-----

Atlantic Treaty, in NATO’s collective defence planning system. It is
fantastical to suppose that today we could defend our state’s territory
and sovereignty without depending on the North Atlantic Treaty
Organisation and it’s collective capabilities. The national Goals of
the Armed Forces, agreed upon by the Republic of Bulgaria and the
Organisation, are inseparable from NATO’s forces for collective
defence.

On the basis of the tasks and missions assigned to the Armed
Forces, to determine the capabilities we need, planning scenarios
have been developped, prioritised and sanctioned. Using that as
foundation, operations have been conceptualised including different
possible lines of action and necessary force. The maintenance of
necessary capabilities and prioritising the want for capabilities is a
matter of constant evaluation of available resources.

The introduction of these scenarios at later stages also requires for
the activities of other national structures and departments, involved in
the consultation and coordination of plans and actions, to be adapted
to deal with different types of crises.

During the strategic rethinking of defence it became clear that
for the successful realisation of a uniform set of forces, **achieving**
**the optimal balance between the planning of capabilities to**
**accomplish the Armed Forces’ role, missions and tasks AND the**
**actual resources available to the state is a necessity. In practice this**
means securing a relatively constant share of GDP for the Ministry
of Defence budget for the next four years – **no less than 1.5%,**
and including other defence expenses and the expenses of military
pensions – not less than 2%. The application of a process of planning
focussed on the shortage of specific capabilities gives us the ability
to find the best resolution to the disproportion between great designs,
requirements and limited resources.


-----

**3. CONSOLIDATION OF POLITICAL**
**WILL FOR GENUINE REFORM**

In the national context, the defence goals set out by the executive
are directed to building an army with modernised capabilities;
establishing principles of transparency and responsibility in the
spending of defence resources; founding the effective management
of defence; and decreasing bureaucratic weight and administrative
expenses.

The political will is directed to achieving greater quality in defence
with a new standard and model for leading an active defence policy –
based on the principles of **efficiency, responsibility, transparency**
**and accountability.** This means decisions are to be taken with the
clear understanding of the reform’s scale and continuity.

The National Security Strategy of the Republic of Bulgaria and the
National Defence Strategy, currently in development, are an essential
part of the reforms in security and defence. Accordingly the force
structure review, the resolutions of which are presented in this White
Paper, is harmonised with the basic strategic parameters set out in the
relevant projects.

**Role, missions and tasks of the Armed Forces**

As a political tool, the role of the Armed Forces is to contribute to
attaining national interests; to defeat opponents together with allied
forces; to keep threats away from state borders; and to contribute to
international peace and security. The results and analyses drawn from
the review conclude that we must keep the current role and missions of
the Armed Forces. However, they also predetermine the actualisation
of the Armed Forces’ tasks. The following **missions and tasks** are
assigned to the Armed Forces:

**Defence –** covers tasks related to guaranteeing the state’s


-----

sovereignty and independence; defence of the territorial integrity of
the state and of NATO member-states through article 5 of the North
Atlantic Treaty.

**Support of international peace and security – includes carrying**
out international and coalition commitments to participate in NATO
and EU operations in response to crises; partaking in missions of the
UN, the OSCE and other coaltion structures; arms control related
activities; the nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction,
checking their media of proliferation and materials for production;
international military partnerships; the provision of humanitarian
relief; and the consolidation of trust and security.

The participation in expeditionary forces and operations is an
important element of the transformation of our Armed Forces. This
participation was among the most essential arguments for rethinking
the Armed Forces’ structure, rearming and modernisation – it
has optimised the combat training with regard to the reality of the
objectives outlined by the missions. The experience gained by our
forces and structures through participation in military operations has
proven to be of exceptional importance. We forsee the continuation of
this benefit by our committed participation in NATO’s operations in
Afghanistan. At the same time we will continue our participation in
the NATO operation in Kosovo and the EU operations in Bosnia and
Hersegovina and the Somalian Basin.

**Contribution to the National Security in Peacetime**
includes: building/maintaining early warning capabilities for potential
risks and threats; activities for control of sea and air space; deterrence
operations; neutralising terrorist, extremist and criminal groups;
protection and defence of strategic sites; protection and support
to the population in case of natural disasters, industrial accidents
and ecological crises; unexploded ordnance disposal; providing
humanitarian relief; support to migration control; search and rescue
activities; support when necessary to other government organisations
and local authorities to prevent and overcome the consequences of
terrorist attacks, natural disasters, industrial accidents, ecological
crises and epidemics.


-----

**Level of political ambition in defence**

According to the capabilities at our disposal and the capabilities
which we plan to achieve, the level of ambition in using the Armed
Forces is:

Mission **Defence – in accordance to the Constitution of the**
Republic of Bulgaria, the Armed Forces defend the sovereignty and
territorial integrity of the country with all available forces and means.
This defence is realised in terms of activating article 5 of the North
Atlantic Treaty – the Armed Forces carry out the defence with the
joint forces and means of NATO’s collective defence, according to
NATO’s common defence planning system. Part of NATO’s forces
would be temporarily deployed on Bulgarian territory.

Upon the activation of Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty
and ensuing action on the territory of other NATO member-states,
the Armed Forces are to provide land, naval and air forces of a
predetermined set, negotiated in NATO’s defence planning framework.
The core component of this set is a brigade tactical group from the
Land Forces on the basis of a medium mechanised brigade.

In this mission the Armed Forces establish: surveilance, control
and defence of air-space through NATO’s integrated air defence
system, including solitary air policing, and perspectively through
NATO’s Missile Defence System; sea surveillance and defence;
maintaining readiness of early warning and command & control
systems; and maintaining national capabilities, functioning within the
allied collective defence system.

Mission **Support of International Peace and Security** – the
Armed Forces maintain a readiness for participation in multinational
allied and coalition crisis response operations . In terms of quantity,
this contribution is expressed by the participation of a reinforced
battalion, or a greater number of smaller units from different military
services, in prolonged operations with rotations within the resource
equivalent to the level of ambition (on average about 1000 men). The
navy participates with declared forces with resources equivalent to
one frigate, for a period of three to six months per year. The air force
participates with helicopters and all staff necessary for their capability,
without rotation, for a period of six months per year. The logistics and


-----

all other necessary elements for our participation in operations are
ensured.

Mission **Contribution to National Security in Peacetime** – to
assist the activities of other government agencies and organisations
by consigning ready and available formations within the existing
capabilities framework, in accordance to developed plans.

The level of political ambition in every mission is based on the
definition of concrete allied commitments, the completion of national
security tasks, as well as the determination of a fixed percentage of
the Gross Domestic Product for the defence budget. The balancing of
political ambition with the resources the Bulgarian public can afford
is a task of critical importance to the Armed Forces.

**The legal entrenchment of the review’s contructive onclusions**

Perfecting the defence-regulating system and the activity of the
Armed Forces is part of the political efforts and the will to realise our
constructive conclusions from the force structure review. Changes and
additions to the Law on Defence and Armed Forces of the Rebublic of
Bulgaria and to acts of lesser legal weight relating to it, are necessary.
Through these changes we will create the necessary legal conditions
to secure the reorganisation of the Armed Forces command structure.
The changes will input new requirements for the military education
system, with the idea of optimising structures duplicating each other
and achieving greater effectiveness of training. New mechanisms
will be introduced to sustain the career development in the military
service.

As for the need for detailed regulations and solidifying the
rights and duties of the citizens and authorities directing the Armed
Forces reserve, the public relations of the reserve, the employment
in it and the military accountability to the citizens – this need will
be regulated by a separate Law on the Reserve, whereby reserve
regulations defined in the Law on Defence and the Armed Forces of
the Republic of Bulgaria will be countermanded.

The creation of a new Law on **Military Police, with which we**
shall extend the functions and powers of the Military Police Service


-----

prescribed to the Minister of Defence, has the aim of realising closer
interactions and relations between it and national police authorities.
It will also countermand relevant texts in the Law on Defence and
the Armed Forces of the Republic of Bulgaria. Thereafter, in view of
perfecting all elements of our defence system and Armed Forces, we
shall develop a Law on Military Intelligence services (currently no
such law exists).

The scale and vigour of the reform will also require changes in
other laws affecting and relating to defence and the Armed Forces.
The legal supervision over establishing the powers of the authorities
directing the state’s defence and over thr completion of tasks assigned
to the Armed Forces and the status of military service is defined in
separated laws (according to the regulatory specifics of those laws).


-----

**4. FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF THE ARMED FORCES**

**New defence management**

One of the leading priorities of our defence policy is the future
development of an integral sytem of effective defence governance
under uniterrupted public control, with a great potential of flexibility,
planning and effective response. This entails the **application of**
**contemporary defence management, founded on principles**
**of good governance and planning, based on the operational**
**capabilities of the forces and the possible scenarios for their use.**

Of particular importance are the processes reviewing defence
policy; the formulation of political guidance; the defence requirements;
the development of defence capabilities; and the evaluation of and
accountability for the performance and results achieved.

In order to concentrate resources on the development of capabilities
the following steps are crucial: the full integration of national
defence planning with NATO defence planning; the perfecting of a
programmed management of defence resources; and the unequivocal
implementation of a programme-driven and result-oriented budget.

Respectively, we are introducing firm mechanisms to optimise
organisation, personalise responsibility and establish standards and
constantly operational procedures in all areas of work. The aim
is for the work organisation in the Ministry of Defence to become
more effective and efficient, while any realised economies are
simultaneously reinvested back into building more modern and better
prepared forces.

In contrast to past attempts to reform the Armed Forces, which
always started from the bottom and faded going to the top, the
principle we have employed requires our reform to **start radically**
**from the top, from the administration of the Ministry of Defence**
**and the organisation of top commanding structures. There can be**
found no contemporary argument to have the staff of top commanding


-----

defence structures, including the General Staff, to surpass 2.5% of
the troops under their command. The practice we are undertaking is
one employed in the armies of our allies and partners in NATO and
the EU, and the ambition of our political leadership is for it to be
firmly enforced. It has been planned that the administration should
not exceed 750 personnel.

The capabilities of the Armed Forces’ command and control system
are based on principles guaranteeing its successful functioning: single
and undivided personal authority, unity of efforts, a strong hierarchical
organisation and clearly formulated leadership. The interrelations of
commanding structures must unconditionally lead to achieving top
efficiency in action and to accomplishing objectives. They must also
be unquestionably clear and exclude all conceivable ambiguity.

At the operational level, from a total of five separate operational
command structures and headquarters, four will remain to be
functionally integrated into a sole operational level. The three
headquarters of the different services of the Bulgarian Army (land,
navy, air) will be directly subordinate to the Joint Forces Command.

In this way we are: constructing a unified command and control
system both for peacetime and in response to crises; eliminating the
duplication of functions through establishing a joint pool of human,
financial and material resources; and increasing the effectiveness and
command and control by evading the need to reconfigure structures
and realign authority and subordination in critical moments of
planning and operations. As a consequence we are also reducing the
workload and training costs for headquarters and staff.

**Future capabilities**

During the force structure review, the national defence capabilities
were structured in a “Catalogue of capabilities for the development
of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Bulgaria”, according to allied
specifications.

On the basis of the formulated role, missions and tasks of the Armed
Forces, to define the necessary capabilities ten planning scenarios were
developed and applied. They were prioritised through the ‘Method of


-----

Prioritisation of Deficient Capabilities’ into three groups according to
the criteria of ‘probability of occurrence’ and ‘anticipated risk’. These
groups served as the foundation for the development of operational
concepts, including lines of action and force requirements.

The asserted operational concepts and the respective force
requirements represent a wholesome picture of the possible lines of
military action according to relevant needs. The concepts include all
predictable threats and circumstances mirrored in the set of scenarios.
This allows for defining the necessary capabilities for the completion
of certain objectives and determines their connections to the relevant
doctrinal base.

The capabilities necessary for the Armed Forces to complete their
assigned missions are directly dependent on the circumstances in
which they will be applied. These circumstances are accounted for
in the development of scenario profiles. The scenario profles include
main objectives, the circumstances under which they have to be
achieved and the standards with which they must be achieved. Within
the profiles are critically defined: the tasks key to achieving desired
ends of the operations; the parameters of the situation in which the
operational planning takes place (physiographic, military and non-
military); and the level of desired effectiveness in the completion of
the objectives set in the given circumstances. Profiles of the levels
from battalion/ship/division/squadron to brigade/base have been
developed additionally. Within this process different capabilities,
including deficient ones, have been prioritised – the “List of Prioritised
Capabilities” has been compiled as a result.

During the review, the current structure of the army and forces
was evaluated according to operational estimates and the technical-
military requirements. The forces structure was determined (as a set
of forces) according to the prescribed needs to respond to specified
operational requirements. In addition, we were able to determine
the discrepancy between necessary and existing capabilities. In the
process we have ultimately determined the existing, the necessary, the
missing and the obsolete/unnecessary capabilities.

The above-mentioned analyses from the review are at the core of
this White Paper, the purpose of which is to publicly present the new
political vision, for the forseable future, of our defence and Armed
Forces. Consequently, the results of these analyses will be detailed in a


-----

concrete Plan for the Development of the Armed Forces, where efforts
will concentrate on sustaining the available necessary capabilities, the
building of the missing capabilities as well as their maintenance and
development. Concurrently, the plan will entail a gradual discharge of
obsolete and unnecessary capabilities. The changes envisaged will create
conditions for the evolutionary development of the Armed Forces – their
systemic upkeep and the building of new and necessary capabilities.

**Changes**

The existing capabilities of the Armed Forces are currently realised
with the following personnel. The total number of the Armed Forces
is 44,100. In that number, 78.7% are military to a total of around
34,700. The remaining 21.3% are civilian, to a total of around 9400
people. The Buglarian Army consists of 34,500 people. Of those,
the military personnel on active duty comes to 30,400 (88.1%) and
civilian personnel 4,100 (11.9%)[4]

50(1)), includes the “Bulgarian Army” plus the Military Police Service, the Military In-
formation Service, the military education institutions, the Military Medical Academy, the
Ceremonial Guard Unit, the Military History Museum and the Reserve. The MoD mili-
tary personnel is also part of the Armed Forces under the Law. Under the same law (Art.
60a(2)) the term _‘Bulgarian Army’ includes the Joint Operations Command, the three_
Services as well as training, maintenance and logistics formations.


-----

A gradual decrease of 7,000 people from the total number of the
Armed Forces by 2014 is planned, where the military on active duty
in the Armed Forces will be decreased by 5,700 and the civilian
personnel by 1,300.

The analyses show that for the maintenance and development of
necessary capabilities, the total number of the Armed Forces can be
no less than 37,000 – of those the military on active duty 73% and the
civilian personnel 19%. The assembling of 3000 reservists is planned,
whereby it will be possible to call them to active duty in the Bulgarian
Army expediently.

A comparison of the current and the planned staffing of the Armed
Forces is shown in figure 2 below.

The Bulgarian Army – the core of the Armed Forces – needs to be
comprised of no less than 26,000 total military and civilian personnel
on active duty. To that number are added 2,700 reservists. The share
of military personnel on active duty is to be 82%, of reservists 10%
and of civilian personnel 8%. With these proportions the efficiency
in carrying out tasks with limited available financial resources is
expected to be significantly improved.

stocks, the military geographic service and other such, are incorporated
in the capabilities package.

The review determined the manner of structural change within
the Armed Forces necessary to bring about the abovementioned
parameters of a desired total number of Armed Forces in balance with
capabilities and resources. The aim is, at the end of the period, to
bring down the expenses on personal staff, on-going maintenance and
capital expenditure in the ratio 60:25:15.

These proportions are closest to the best management practices
in the defence organisations of many of our allies. They will allow
for the best management of our personnel, for effective preparation
procedures and for the modernisation of the Armed Forces.

As a result of the reforms and with a fixed defence budget of 1.5%
of GDP, we will secure a significantly greater quality of support and
greater per capita funding on military personnel – rising from 29,000
lv. (approx. €15,000) to 43,600 lv. (approx. €22,300) per serviceman.
This will consequently result in modern equipping and arming, as
well as a greater level of battle readiness and efficiency.

**Structure of the Armed Forces**

**_Land Forces_**

The Land Forces contribute significantly to the completion of
the Armed Forces’ three missions. They participate in the country’s
defence in a collective defence system. They partake in collective
defence activities outside the country’s territory and in joint operations
against terrorism.

To support international peace and security, The Land Forces
are actively involved in international operations concerning: crisis
response beyond national borders; reassuring peace and security;
arms control and nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction; as
well as the implementation of international trust and security support
measures.

Their contribution to national security in peacetime is composed
of the defence of key infrastructure; the fight with organised crime
and the traffic of people, drugs and weapons; aiding the state and local
authorities in preparing, supporting and protecting the population, the
rural economy and the national territory, to respond to non-military
crises and dealing with related consequences.

In 2010, in accordance to their functional roles, the Land Forces
are comprised of two force groups – deployable forces and support
forces, where both groups have high and low levels of readiness for
action.

In 2010, the Land Forces comprise of: a headquarters; brigades
for different types of military action; a brigade HQ; regiments and
subdivisions for military support and providing logistics; and units
for training.

The analyses and conclusions regarding the role and placement of
the Land Forces in the next 10-15 years, conjured the following vision
for their development: as a major branch of the Bulgarian Army’s
forces, they are to package, equip, prepare and support deployable
land based units capable of participation in a wide spectrum of NATO
operations both on and beyond the state’s territory. To complete the
tasks assigned to them, the Armed Forces have to build the mandatory
capabilities to achieve the relevant level of ambition.

-----

From admissions made for the possibility of the Land Forces to
complete one or more planning scenarios simultaneously, we have
determined the necessary organisational structure to be comprised of
a commander and headquarters, two brigades, four regiments, two
specialised preparations centers; four self-dependent battalions and a
training ground.

By realising the stated plans for reorganisation and modernisation,
the Land Forces will acquire a more flexible structure and the
realistically necessary capabilities to participate in present-day
operations. One of the major challenges will be the modernisation
and rearmament of units with arms and military technology of
contemporary standards.

**_Air Force_**

The Air Force guarantees the sovereignty of the Republic of
Bulgaria by executing the surveillance, protection and defence of
its air space. It also carries out duties for NATO’s collective defence
system.

The Airforce maintains a state of constant readiness, leads the
preparations and partakes in the execution of operations. It exercises
aerial navigation control and secures the inviolability of the state’s
airspace, within NATO’s air defence system.

The Air Force participates in peace-keeping operations outside
national territory.

The Air Force executes tasks related to the defence of key
infrastructure; the fight with organised crime and the traffic of people,
drugs and weapons; aiding the state and local authorities in preparing,
supporting and protecting the population, the rural economy and the
national territory, to respond to non-military crises and dealing with
the related consequences.

The organisation of the Air Force comprises of units and
subdivisions from different military services – aviation, air defence
forces, radar and communications & navigations maintenance and
logistics forces.

The organisational structure of the Air Force in 2010 includes:
a headquarters; an air operations center; a fighters air base; a


-----

-----

hellicopter air base; an air defence brigade; air force training base
“Georgi Benkovski”; a forward operations base; a radar regiment; a
maintenance base; a meteo center; a technical base; a training range;
an air defence range; a storage base; a specialised preparations center;
and a military band.

After the force structure review, the Air Force will be organised
to include: a commander and headquarters; two air force bases (Graf
Ignatievo and Krumovo); a forward operations base; an air defence
base; a command, control and surveillance base; a specialised
equipment base; and a military police company.

**Figure 9: Structure of the Air Force by 2014**

We have several projects envisaged for the rearmament and
modernisation to secure the substitution of old and building of new
Air Force capabilities.

**_Navy_**

The Navy guarantees the sovereignty and defends the interests of
the Republic of Bulgaria in its sea space. The Navy participates in
joint operations for the defence of national territory and the Republic
of Bulgaria’s sea space, within the collective defence system. Outside
national territory it partakes in collective defence actions with a
specified force – anti-terrorist operations; patrolling of sea regions;


-----

embargo operations; escorting of exceptionally valuable ships and
cargos; and mine-clearing operations. The Navy executes constant
surveillance and announcement of sea space conditions, control of
naval navigation, and defence of naval communications and the
economy at sea.

The Navy also partakes in operations supporting international
peace and security by: executing surveillance; reconnaissance of the
(tactical) situation and control in the zone of operation; participating
in joint and/or multinational operations against terrorism; contributing
to the prevention of illegal human, drugs and weapon traffic by sea;
executing tasks on embargo, humanitarian aid, evacuation and rescue
operations.

The Navy’s contribution to national security in peacetime is
composed of: aiding the state and local authorities in preparing,
supporting and protecting the population, the rural economy and
national territory, to respond to non-military crises and overcoming the
related consequences; contributing to the defence of key strategic sites
and sea infrastructure; the fight with organised crime and the traffic of
people, drugs and weapons; and participating in the search and rescue
of people at sea and humanitarian and evacuation operations.

The Navy’s structure by 2010 is comprised of a headquarters, two
naval bases (Varna and Burgas) and the headquarters’ support units.

For the maintenance and development of the necessary operational
capabilities, arising from new realities and challenges, as well as for
achieving interoperability of our Navy with NATO member-states, we
envisage the modernisation of available combat ships, the acquisition
of new helicopters and the development of coastal reconnaissance
and navigation installations.

**_Logistics_**

In logisitics we find the most serious challenge to the adaptation of
our Armed Forces to the requirements of contemporary expeditionary
operations. The force structure review made obvious the need to transform
the logistics system to a single integrated and mobile system, for peace
and war, for logistical support of the Armed Forces and adequate to their
structure, missions and tasks, and providing the possibility of effective
and efficient use of the material resources for defence.


-----

To reach this goal, the priority for the logistics system is to achieve
the optimal conjunction of the separated logistic support for military
formations, the centralised logistics support, multinational logistics
and the logistical capabilitites of the host-country. This requires
reaching optimal efficiency of the logistics support structure on all
levels.

The reform will affect the operational and tactical levels of logistics.
At the operational level we will disband the Maintenance and Support
Headquarters. The centralised logistical provision for the formations
of the Bulgarian Army will be executed through the logistical services
and capabilities of the Joint Forces Command and the commander of
the three services of the Armed Forces.

At the tactical level the core logistical intrument will be situated
in the “Logistics” brigade, subordinate to the Joint Forces Command,
with its mobile and stationary formations – a transport battalion
and bases for storage, repair and servicing of material resources. A
wholesome executive logistical structure will function throughout all
formations, units and subdivisions of the Armed Forces’ services.

**_Command and Control_**

The system for command and control of the Armed Forces will be
reviewed in the context of achieving effective control and making the
strategic and operational level command structures compatible with
the tenets of modern armed forces management. The command and
control of the Armed Forces constitutes of the strategic, operational
and tactical levels of command.

At the **_strategic level_** the responsibility for forming and
carrying out national defence policy is held by the Minister of
Defence in his role as a single central authority of the executive
over the Armed Forces. The Ministry of Defence is a single
political-military body in charge of forming and executing
national defence policy, which combines civil and military
expertise and which functions based on the democratic principles
of public oversight of the Armed Forces.

The Chief of Defence is unequivocally subordinated to the
Minister of Defence and aids him/her in the execution of the office’s
functions– the creation and execution of defence policy and the use


-----

of the Armed Forces. The Chief of Defence executes his prerogatives
through the commanding officer – a priori the Commander – of the
Joint Forces Command.

The Defence Headquartersis an integrated part of the Ministry
of Defence, and it provides the Minister of Defence with military
expertise. In the near future, its functions will increase to include the
leading of projects related to defence and security; the analyses for
necessary defence and operational capabilities; the development of
plans and requirements for the development of the Armed Forces; the
generation of strategic analyses; the formation of logistical provision
policy for the Armed Forces, including securing the required resources
for them; moderdisation and more.

At the operational level, the commanding officer (the Commander)
of the Joint Forces Command and the Commanders of the Land
Forces, Air Force and Navy, aided by their relevant heaquarters, form
a single funtionally integrated structure, with clearly defined functions
and responsibilities. In this structure, the overarching characteristic
is **jointness. The Commanders of the three services of the Armed**
Forces are subordinate to the commanding officer (Commander) of
the the Joint Forces Command.

Jointness and joint functional integration at the operational level
allows for the optimised work of personnel and the organisational
personnel structure of the different headquarters. The Joint Forces
Command unites and executes only those functions and activities
which are common to all three services – joint intelligence, joint
operations, joint logistics and communications.

At the same time, the planning resources of the Joint Forces
Command support the commanders of the different military services
in planning their independent operations. In joint operations, the
planning resources of the headquarters of the military services are
fully engaged in working for the Headquarters of the Joint Forces
Command. We expect that the territorial disposition of the HQ of
the Joint Forces Command, the headquarters of the Land Forces and
the headquarters of the Air Force being in the same building will
ease their functional unity. At this stage, the review does not propose
moving of the Navy headquarters to Sofia, but defines the guarantee
of enough technological communication capabilities for joint efforts
in real time. Moreover, the disposition of the aforementioned three


-----

headquarters in one building establishes the physical availability
of each for optimised planning and horizontal interaction and
cooperation of military persons and units.

**Figure 12: System for Command and Control at Strategic and Operational Level**

The Joint Forces Command maintains the capabilities to organise
and control all processes in its subordinate structures, regarding:

– The management of day-to-day activities; the collection of
data on the situation and condition of the personnel and forces of
the Bulgaria Army; the preparation of subordinate commanders,
personnel and forces; the support of battle and mobilisation readiness;
operational control of forces on duty and resources; the deployment of
military forces beyond borders and the exercise of national command
and control;

– The planning, provision and exercise of operations in response to
crises, according to the instructions of the Minister and thereafter the
Chief of Defence; the development of preliminary operational plans
for the use of the Armed Froces according to the planning scenarios
and strategic concepts;


-----

– The upkeep of a constantly operational joint operations center,
providing necessary information to all other ministries and agencies, to
the Bulgarian Army and structures directly subordinate to the Minister
of Defence; contributing to the realisation of national command and
control of military forces beyond national borders; the operational
control of forces on duty and resources in peacetime.

Thanks to the capabilities of the stationary and mobile communi-
cations system, the joint operations center can function as a national
crisis center for operational leadership of military formations and civ-
il authorities in operations, with the objective of solving crises in and
outside the country.

The commanders and headquarters of the Land Forces, Air Force,
and Navy organise and carry out the full daily routines and the
provisions for their subordinate structures. They plan and execute the
millitary training of subordinated formations, units and subdivisions
for the independent or in-structure use of joint operational forces. They
build and maintain the headquarters’ planning and control capabilities
for independent operations and for participation in the planning process
of joint operations through the Joint Forces Command. They build and
upkeep the capabilities of deployment, provision and maintenance for
their own forces’ activities and resources, and they prepare and present
the formations ready to participate in missions abroad.

During the execution of independent operations, the commanders
of the military services control their subordinate tactical formations. In
joint operations, they form HQ-elements of all three military services
to control the units and forces participating in the joint operation.

The staff element of the Land forces is built with capabilities to
take key elements in the field; to establish control outside the main
camp; to provide C2 connectivity to the Land Forces Commander; to
effectively control subordinate formations in the joint operation – in
general to secure the deployment of the core formations and logistical
maintenance formations. The Land Forces element, together with
forces and resources from the Joint Forces Command, also exercises
the function of a forward command post for the Joint Forces Command.
This will also optimise the needs of communications support.

For the execution of special forces operations, the Land Forces
headquarters forms a special element for their control.


-----

The Air Force staff element for joint operations supports constant
operational capabilities to execute the tasks assigned to the Air Force
in the joint operation zone. For the control of Air Force actions during
the operation, the Air Force use the same C2 structure as in peacetime.
Forward control posts can also be deployed.

The naval staff element plans and controls the actions and forces
of the fleet in the joint operation zone. Depending on its characteristic
(i.e. when the operation zone is not in sea space), the naval element
exercises tasks for the Joint Forces Command, on oraganising and
realising cooperation with the naval forces of other countries in the
zone of operation.

At the **_tactical level,_** the commanders of formations, units and
subdivisions are subordinate to the commanders of the relevant
services of the Armed Forces. The commanders of communications
and logistics units and subdivisions are directly subordinate to the
Joint Forces Command. Their staff and subordinate formations
build and support deployability capabilities. They also maintain the
logistical provision systems through mobilisational resources and
communications support for the Bulgarian Army during peacetime
and for the whole of the Armed Forces during crises.

**_Communications Support of the Command_**
**_and Control Structure_**

The communications system of the Armed Forces secures the
support of the established command and control system for all
missions and tasks. It is comprised of communication networks and a
system of control posts.

At the strategic and operational level, stationary control posts are
kept operational. For the control of military forces during operations,
the creation and maintenance of mobile modules for deployment on
field control posts is envisaged: for the Joint Forces Command, for
the Land Forces, as well as for a national support element during the
deploymend of NATO forces on our territory and the execution of
operation outside national territory.

We envisage the communications system to be divided into a
stationary and a mobile part, structured into two formations. The
stationary part, subordinate to the Ministry of Defence, will secure


-----

communications support at the strategic level. The mobile part is
subordinate to the Joint Forces Command and executes tasks assig­
ned by it.

The stationary Communications system for the Ministry of Defence
and the Bulgarian Army maintains the connection and exploitation
readiness of stationary communication junctions, thus providing for:
the headquarters at strategic and operational levels; the structures
necessary for the cooperation of the Ministry of Defence with other
ministries and agencies; the structures necessary for building an
Integrated Communications System for control of the country; as well
as supporting formations.

Following the force structure review, we need a revision of the
project for the development of a stationary communications network.
The disbanding of garrisons and military areas will free financial
resources. The freed finances will be directed to the integration of
the stationary communications network with the networks of other
ministries and agencies so as to build a single information network.
The simultaneous delivery ontasks will increase the integrity of the
system for control over the nation. The use of a single information
network will significantly decrease expenses on the technical
maintenance of our communications systems. It will secure
possibilities for a wider use of commercial software products and
services that reach end users. This way, we will create conditions for
the minimalisation of expenses on valuable and specialised software
for the military. There will be an increase of access possibilities for
public inquiries (to the informational resources for of the Ministry
of Defence, within specific boundries) on the drafting of documents
and information on the Bulgarian Army. However, the use of a
single information network will increase the need of greater cyber-
defence capabilities.

The new priorities of the Armed Forces demand the development
of mobile formations for communications maintenance capabilities.
It is necessary to review the new delivery contracts and to make the
adequate changes to ensure that the mobile formation are modern and
with NATO standard technological systems.


-----

**_Military Intelligence_**

The Military Intelligence unites all the intelligence resources
in the Armed Forces and is responsible for the timely acquisition,
development and distribution of necessary intelligence information.
The management of the military intelligence is realised in a single and
centralised intelligence process.

For this purpose capabilites are developed and maintained to secure
the timely discovery and warning of risks and threats to national
security and the intelligence support for formations in operations and
missions.

The complex and dynamic security environment and the
characteristics of present-day risks and threats requires tasks of a
wider functional and territorial spectrum from the military intelligence
service. Military aspects aside, it has to evaluate assymetric risks and
threats, terrorist activities, level of threat to our military forces, as
well as the religious, psychological, cultural, historical and any other
identity characteristics of the population in the security environment
in which our Armed Forces are active.

The Bulgarian military intelligence is part of the NATO and EU
intelligence community. Within, it carries out a constant exchange of
information and participates in the intelligence support of operations
and special activities of allied and coalition forces. It also establishes
informational and operational cooperation with partner agencies, in
the interest of national security and the defence of the state.

The intelligence carried out within the Armed Forces of the
Republic of Bulgaria is centralised, organised and executed at the
strategic, operational and tactical levels.

At the strategic level, the intelligence is organised and exercised
by the intelligence services of the Ministry of Defence, especially the
“Military Information” service. These services support and develop
capabilities for the acquisition of strategic intelligence by using
human factors and techonological means – by analysing, predicting,
developing and presenting intelligence to the political and military
leadership, to the bulgarian contingents in missions, to NATO, to
the European Union and to partner agencies, for the timely warning
of risks and threats to security, for operational planning and in the
interest of the national defence policy.


-----

At the operational level, intelligence is organised by the Joint
Forces Command, with the participation of strategic-level intelligence
services and the headquarters of the different military services. It is led
by the intelligence formations from the three services of the Armed
Forces. The main activity is directed to preparing and supporting
human and technological intelligence resources, and the realisation of
intelligence support for operations.

At the tactical level, intelligence is organised by the commanders
of companies and subdivisions, and is led by their subordinate
reconnaissance/intelligence units/bodies, in the interest of their
objectives and the task they are assigned to. To achive these
capabilities, the army maintains and supports formations of different
types, and with different means of acquiring intelligence and leading
electronic warfare in the battle area.

**_Military Police_**

The military police is a structure in the Armed Forces’ configuration
for the maintenance of order and security in the Ministry of Defence,
the structures directly subordinate to the Minister of Defence and in
the Bulgarian Army.

The military police constitutes of the “Military Police” service and
the military-police formations in the military branches of the Armed
Forces.

The main tasks of the “Military Police” service are related to the
discovery, prevention, counteraction and investigation of criminal and
other acts endangering order and security, as well as control and guard
posts. Its duties include the discovery and neutralisation of terrorist
acts directed against the state’s Armed Forces, NATO military and
civilian representatives, and countries partaking in military exercises
on the territory of the Republic of Bulgaria and beyond it. The service
also executes analytical, prognostic and informational activities.

The service will continue to work independently and at the same
time in cooperation with other public security agencies, national
authorities, organisations and citizens, to direct resources against
crime and for the preservation of public order.

The organisation of the “Military Police” service is comprised of a


-----

leadership, regional services and a center for logistics and personnel
training and preparations. The regional services are positioned
territorially. Their location is appropriate to securing the detachments
of the Bulgarian Army, the territorial structures directly subordinate to
the Minister of Defence, the military-provincial prosecutor’s offices
and the military courts in the Republic of Bulgaria.

Military police formations are included in subdivisions in the
composition of the different military services and are directly
subordinate to their commanders. They provide military order and
discipline in the garrisons of military detachments, as well as the
security of military sites.

**_Military education, science and training_**

The military education system will develop according to national
and european legislation and to the NATO directive for organisation
and execution of individual training of military personnel. According
to the results of the review, it is not necesssary to restructure the
military education system, because at this stage it statisfies the
preparatory conditions set before it.

The review envisages the internal optimisation of strucutres and
of the different military colleges, changes in the periods and forms
of education in them, and an actualisation of education programmes.

We forsee the process of optimising the military colleges will
bring about a decrease in the administrative and provisional staff. The
aim is fuller use of information technology based on web-training,
simulations and simulators, and the introduction of contemporary
technology in teaching and learning.

The training periods are being optimised in the “G.S. Rakovski”
Military Academy, in the National Military University and in the
Naval College. In the latter two, in addition to the previous education
model for cadets and students, we will create new opportunities for
the accreditation and training of soldiers, sargeants and civilians with
university degrees willing to obtain military qualifications.

The military programmes will allow for the simultaneous
completion of military training of three cadet training courses with
the respective periods of 5 years, 3 years and 1.5 years.


-----

Professional sergeant colleges are also optimising their cadet
training plans and programmes in accordance with the current model.
An option is created where one can achieve the military qualification
of “junior sergeant” after finishing a course for higher military
qualification for professional soldiers. Alongside the just mentioned
creation of new courses, the existing ones for advancement and
qualifications are being improved with the goal of securing the career
development of sergeant staff.

In the military colleges, courses are being organised for the
qualification and re-qualification of military and civilian personnel.
We plan for the civilian personel, before their first appointment/duty,
to pass qualification training courses in the “G.S. Rakovski” Academy.

Scientific research & expertise support to the Armed Forces
will continue to be carried out by the existing scientific structures
subordinate to the Ministry of Defence. Organisational and structural
changes in the military education system’s sceintific research sector
and in the directions of its activities, with regard to the preparations
of the Armed Forces, are not foreseen. We are planning to turn the
Defence Institute into a leading structure in the Ministry of Defence’s
organisation, to conduct scientific research, support and attend
scientific projects and experiments in the interest of defence.

**_Civil-Military Cooperation_**

Civil-military cooperation, as a set of measures and acitivities for
interaction and coordinating the activity of the military leader with
outsider military structures, organisations and local authorities in the
operation zone, is of critical importance to the operation’s success

According to the prescribed level of political ambition for
participating in operations, the review states that the available
capabilities for civil-military cooperations in general satisfies the
minimal military criteria. Consequently, no building of new capabilities
is foreseen here. We are keeping the current CIMIC Land Forces
company and the relevant structures in charge of this organisation.
We are planning the creation of a mixed battalion for civil-military
cooperation, geographic information-gathering and psychological
operations. Within it a natural connection between civil-military
cooperation and psychological operations will be established.


-----

For the direct contact of anyone with possibly crucial mission
information in the operation area, we are retaining the capability
of operating a Center for Civil-Military Cooperation, the main task
of which is to receive such information, regardless of whether it is
specific to problems in the civilian zone or otherwise.

**Defence Infrastructure**

The Ministry of Defence has to provide the Armed Forces with
adequate infrastructure of different types, to satisfy their basic
needs and to correspond to the operational, tactical and technical
requirements for the deployment of military forces.

The construction and management of defence infrastructure is
directed according to the realistic needs of the troops/forces. The
inherited public state properties for army use from the Cold War were
widely dispersed across national territory and a great many of them
were located in urban areas. A lot of the infrastructure was initially
on the periphery of inhabited settlements, but ended up inside due
to urban expansion. This creates problems for both the military units
and the development of the territories themselves. Up till the 1980s,
the territorial model of Armed Forces’ positioning strongly reflected
classical defence concepts and led to the progressive accumulation of
infracrtucture over time, without any account of the realistic needs of
the army. Concurrently, the shortage of investments in maintenance
and repair has strongly accelerated the ageing of our defence
infrastructure.

The new realities and needs of the Armed Forces require the full
scale examination on the present state of defence infrastrucutre, the
development of a clear vision on the desired infrastructure and the
undertaking of adequate measures for the release of unnecessary parts.

As a result, a new approach has been undertaken in the Ministry
of Defence, based on clear and corroborated future advantages. New
infrastructure will be built only when the economy allows it, when
proven necessary and functional, and when it leads to the realisation
of real operational defence capabilities. The same will apply for
the maintenance, repair and modernisation of the existing defence
infrastructure.


-----

Up to this moment, the Armed Forces’ subdivisions are optimally
concentrated in regions with suitable locations and sufficient national
and military infrastructure. The whole process of declaring army
properties and housing stock being released as a result of the structural
reform, is done with complete transparencey. We are checking every
option to increase the joint use of installations by the structures of
the Armed Forces. A great effort is made to fully exploit NATO’s
programme for security investments, through which arises the chance
for the construction and modernisation of joint allied infrastructure on
the territory of Bulgaria.

By August 2010, the organisational structures of the Armed Forces
and the Defence Headquarters are located in 280 military areas,
divided more or less equally on the state’s territory. These areas
consits of housing stock, depots, wrokshops, citizens, military ports
and airports, training grounds, learning centers and ranges – all of
which provide daily activity and military preparations and training. In
total, the structures of the main defence infrastructure reach 8,500 in
number, with a total floor area of 3,500,000 m².

A significant part of the housing stock is in need of major repairs.
Limited financial resources for the maintenance and repair of
infrastructure is the reason for the severe depreciation of a great part it
and for the impossibility to use it. According to operational estimates,
to maintain and perfect the defence infrastructure, 450 million leva
are necessary (approx. €230 million).

In relation to the force structure review and the Force Development
Plan, by the end of 2014, we will significantly decrease the total size of
military areas. This will bring about a reduction of 800-900 structures
in the main infrastructure, with a total floor area of 400,000 m², and
significant financial savings for maintenance and repairs.

The upkeep of defence infrastructure is connected to both the
completion of maintenance & support tasks and the processing of
information related to: the release of military areas and changing the
status of their function, their use and their prospective development;
to terrains and properties; and to housing stock. The release of
unnecessary property is done through sales and free concessions to
other departments and municipalities, including government returns
of land and forests to meet public needs. Real estate sales conferred
to MOD management are executed by decision of the Council of


-----

Ministers upon proposal of the Minister of Defence. The Ministry
of Defence also takes advantage of the opportunity of spending
resources through NATO’s Security Investment Program (NSIP) for
the construction and modernisation of the existing infrastructure of
military airports and ports, communication and information systems,
of logistics and more. So far through this program over 10 million lv.
(approx. €5.1 million) have been appropriated, and by the end of 2014
we are planning to appropriate about an extra 70-80 million (approx.
€36-41 million).

**Resources**

**_Human Resources_**

People are the main potential and guarantee for the success
in any defence matter. Through modern approaches, clear rules
and mechanisms for effective and efficient management of human
resources, we will provide the defence system and the Armed
Forces with trained and motivated staff. For that purpose, the
attraction, recruitment and selection are planned and carried out
based on the overall assessment of the risks and competition in the
labour market.

The Bulgarian Armed Forces are professional. A strong driving
force in the human resource management policy is our membership
in NATO and the European Union. Bulgarian military and civilian
personnel are together day-to-day with colleagues from allied
command structures, headquarters, operations, exercises and training.
They work with them under significant burdens and risks, and high
standards of professionalism and dedication. They thus provide
an important contribution to Allied efforts in addressing common
security challenges. Respectively our aim is for the recruitment,
training, qualification, preparation, social status and all-round security
of military personnel and their families to meet their standards and
requirements.

The new policy and system for managing human resources are
directed towards the professionalisation of the army by realising
its personnel’s full potential, thus rendering a motivated staff with
effective qualities. The preparation of leaders capable of committing


-----

to their objectives and the management of human potential is of key
importance.

The successful management of personnel development is aimed
at ensuring the manning of the Armed Forces with talented people
with the appropriate qualifications and experience, and at taking into
account the needs of both the Armed Forces and the individual. The
new aspect in the selection system is the introduction of clear and
strict procedures and criteria to minimise subjectivity in this process.
Reappointment and dismissal of military personnel, as well as their
rotation to different positions, are determined and executed by strict
rules, depending on the chosen career development path. The rotation
to new positions is necessary to acquire the necessary experience,
since senior officers pass through various positions at one or more
command levels.

Military personnel will attest to newly structured criteria each year,
by which they will be assessed. Points of reference will include the
characteristics of their personality, the achievement of agreed-upon
professional goals, the extent of the duties, professional qualities and
experience.

In a professional army the search for a new approach to formation,
advancement, management, administration, use and preparation of
human resources in the Reserve Force, and equipment of the Armed
Forces, is imperative. In this context, the mission of the Reserve forces
will be to promptly provide ready personnel and equipment, with
which to increase the capabilities of the Armed Forces’ formations
and, when required, to carry out their tasks both in peace and in
wartime.

We envisage the establishment of a territorial Reserve, which would
be used during peacetime to support the activities of the executive
and local authority branches in protecting the public from disaster; in
conducting rescues and emergency repair work; with restoration and
protection of affected areas; and, when necessary, with the deployment
of military units in crises of a military nature. The preparation of
territorial Reserve formations in peacetime will be planned, organised
and led by the Ministry of Defence, and respectively used by regional
governors and mayors.

The reserve should be built with the personnel, number and structure


-----

to meet the needs of the Armed Forces according their missions and
tasks, with a centralised control and authority system, and allocated
according to administrative-territorial division of the country.

What is new is that compiling the reserve will be done on a volun­

tary basis in peacetime, but when the country is under “martial law”,
“emergency” or at “war” – mandatory. This determines the division of
the reserve into voluntary and mandatory parts.

_The voluntary reserve will have an optimal quantitative and_
qualitative composition and correspond to the realistic financial
resources for the country. It should be provided with adequate training
programmes, motivation and incentives. This type of reserve will
increase assistance in peacetime and will be used in a wide spectrum
of missions and operations, including protection of the population
during disasters and emergencies. In this context the relationship
between the Ministry of Defence, the central and territorial executive
authorities and employers will be legally regulated. Personnel in this
category will consist of Bulgarian citizens with military training fit
for military service in peacetime, who have voluntarily committed
themselves to a combined civilian-military career.

_The mandatory (mobilisation) reserve will consist of persons_
listed in the reserve, with military or other special training, who
have received a mobilisation assignment to formations in the Armed
Forces, as well as equipment set for their assembling and formation in
wartime provided by the state economy.

The voluntary service in the reserve will be implemented in
peacetime as an active or passive service.

The active service will include the period during which reservists
were called to active duty in the composition of their respective
army units, structural units or formations for training, preparation,
increasing qualifications, and while participating in missions and
operations. During the active service the reservist will be assigned
to full-time duty or part-time duty in the establishment of the army
formation. He will enjoy all the rights of a serviceman and will receive
basic and additional fees, or part thereof, in proportion to the length
of active service.

Passive service will cover the period during which the reservist is
not called to active duty. During the passive service reservists will be


-----

available, ready for mobilisation, and in that period they will receive
certain annual benefits and honorarium.

The management of activities regarding the organisation,
management, accounting, preparation, and summoning of Reserve
forces will be executed and exercised by the Minister of Defence,
through the military administration. This will replace the existing
system of military districts.

Thus the planned system for the Reserve will provide additional
resources for the formations during peace and wartime and will
strengthen its role as an integral part of the Armed Forces. It will also
free the Reserve from a number of redundant but currently performed
activities regarding reports on Bulgarian citizens and technology.

**_Financial Resources_**

The analyses created in the Ministry of Defence indicate that at
the end of 2008, Bulgaria’s defence sector consumed substantial
quantities of economic resources, measured in human, financial and
material real value. This comes to show that in comparison with
our allies, our country maintains one of the most expensive defence
systems, which burdens the economic and demographic realities we
have to face. Recalculated in purchasing power standards, the defence
costs to the Bulgarian taxpayer puts Bulgarian soldier among the
most expensive. However, in real terms, he is among the most poorly
resourced and insured.

The projected changes concluded from the Force Structure
Review were subject to constant assessment in terms of the necessary
resources for their realisation. Thus all capabilities have been valued
in the composition of the Armed Forces – the necessary, the existing,
the missing and those no longer needed. This model permits a balance
between planned capabilities and available resources.

At present, a combination of internal and external state factors is
exerting high pressure on the Ministry of Defence budget and in trying
to securing the necessary financial resources for the state’s defence.
With this in mind, programme-planning will be seriously hindered.

The Force Structure Review showed that the budget’s programme
management is central to a _programming approach based on_

_capabilities. As such it represents an achievement and an integral part_
of the modern management of Defence.

Ensuring the long-term budget of the Ministry of Defence as a
percentage of the GDP is of critical importance. This will provide the
continued financial sustainability of the macroeconomic framework
vital for defence – a condition which is imposed by the length and
scale that inevitably accompany the establishment and maintenance
of the operational capabilities our army’s needs.

As a result of the force structure review and taking into account
the experience and recommendations of our allies, the programming
structure of the Ministry of Defence has been updated. Consequently
the number of programmes was reduced to ten. With them we will
increase the effectiveness and efficiency in planning and spending of
our limited budgetary resources.

We plan to provide of greater financial autonomy of the Joint
Forces Command, the brigades and the bases of the Armed Forces,
which will implement the policy of decentralisation of budget


-----

expenditures. This will relieve the central and operational authorities
from responsibilities and activities inappropriate to their level and will
permit the optimization of their efficiency. Concurrently, the brigades
and bases will have more operational freedom to solve their current
maintenance problems.

Aiming for transparency of military expenditures, through
decentralisation we will ensure maximum commitment to the real
needs of the troops with their available resources in mind.


-----

**5. INDUSTRY, TECHNOLOGY AND DEFENCE**

In a market economy, the defence industry retains its uniqueness
among other economic sectors because of its special relationship with
the state as its regulator, investor and primary consumer.

The uniqueness of the Bulgarian technological and industrial
defence base and the role of the Ministry of Defence determine the
office’s exceptional ability to have an immediate impact on the entire
base, including on its research and development components. The
Bulgarian technological and industrial defence base, in turn, affects
the environment, directions and parameters of the transformation of
defence capabilities. This interdependence has to be developed into a
fruitful type of fresh relations between the Ministry and the defence
industry, which are to replace the current distancing of their practices.

The global financial and economic crisis forced the reconsideration
of the MOD’s investment plans and policies. The contraction in
investment costs associated with the building of defence capabilities
(in particular new weapons, equipment and systems) forge a new
paradigm of planning which will lead to the rearrangement of priorities
and a change of approach.

The immediate objective is a sharp and visible increase of
efficiency and effectiveness in spending Bulgarian taxpayers’ money,
for example by taking advantage of our membership in NATO and
the European Union, which provide opportunities for sharing defence
costs as well as significantly improving their effectiveness.

The state of the Bulgarian defence industry and research &
development is primarily a result of 20[th] century investments.
The product structure and opportunities are concentrated in the
technological sector, which meets the defence’s lower level
requirements.

The contraction of our own and external investments, and
especially of the costs of research and development led to a sharp
reduction of the sector’s export potential and to its value to the
Bulgarian economy. This trend has а significant negative impact


-----

on national security. If this state of the Bulgarian technological and
industrial defence base remains, the industry’s potential to meet the
future material requirements of the Armed Forces will be reduced
evermore progressively.

The Ministry of Defence will develop a fundamentally new, unified
and comprehensive policy for Bulgaria’s technological and industrial
defence base, in the context of NATO and EU membership, for the
technological developments in warfare and the needs for development
and maintenance of the material component of defence capabilities.

The Ministry of Defence’s clear vision and plans to develop the
capabilities of the Armed Forces will provide conditions for the
industry to develop well-informed long-term investment programmes
in new technological and production capacities. For this purpose we
will established an industry forum to ensure the direct interaction,
stable partnership and firm dialogue between government institutions,
the industry and the research and development community with
interests in defence.

In the next two years the Ministry of Defence will expand its
participation in international research and development projects and
programmes in NATO and the European Union. This will enable
the acquisition of high-tech know-how, industrial participation in
the implementation of new key programmes for the development of
defence capabilities, and efficiency in investment spending.

Investing in new technologies will provide upgraded capabilities
to businesses – a necessity for both the progress of the Armed Forces
and the transformation of the Bulgarian defence industry into a
competitive participant in the logistics chain of global manufacturers
and suppliers of defence equipment.

Recognising this, the Ministry of Defence will determine the key
areas in technology and their priorities, which is necessary not only
in the process of acquisition of new defence products, but also for the
orientation of the defence industry in ensuring the duration of their
life cycle.

On the basis of available opportunities in international cooperation
and priority technological areas, the Ministry of Defence will determine
the priorities for defence and security research and technology, and
will organise the development of a national programme to achieve


-----

them. This programme will link scientific research with the priorities
and needs of defence, creating a basis for informing and involving the
industry in defence research and technology, and for strengthening
civil-military cooperation in research and technology.

The Ministry of Defence will not limit itself to current project-
managing models and plans for modernisation. It will introduce
modern business practices and approaches to the management of
investment in defence.

**A long-term investment plan to cover the main platforms and**
**systems of the Armed Forces will be developed. The programmes**
**and projects incorporated in the plan will be prioritised and**
**financially set for the period up to 2020.**

The plan will also include activities for the release of no-longer
exploited assets to which Minister of Defence is the principal, and
for which the ministry will analyse the business possibilities so as to
maximise the value of the divestment process.

The changes in offset legislation reveal new opportunities and
additional incentive for the Ministry of Defence’s foreign business
partners to commit to long-term investments in the defence sector. The
Ministry of Defence will use these opportunities to ensure investments
in high-tech industries and in the research and development activities
of the Bulgarian technological and industrial defence base.

The Ministry of Defence will seek, wherever possible, to implement
public-private partnerships and outsourcing as effective mechanisms
for reducing the total lifecycle costs of defence resources, as well
as to secure additional financing, risk sharing and increasing the
effectiveness of defence resources.


-----

**6. TRANSPARENCY POLICY OF THE MINISTRY**
**OF DEFENCE**

The introduction of new management practices active in uprooting
conditions for corruption in the Ministry of Defence play a fundamental
role in enhancing the effectiveness of defence policy, simultaneously
with the establishment of appropriate values, morals and behaviour of
people in defence.

With the adoption of the amendment of the Law on Defence and
Armed Forces of the Republic of Bulgaria (LDAFRB / ЗОВСРБ),
we are introducing a system for the effective management of an
integrated ministry, in terms of transparency and accountability,
whereby fighting corruption and avoiding conflicts of interest are
determined as priorities on all levels in the ministry.

The already set up Standing Committee on Anti-Corruption in the
Ministry of Defence carries out the Government’s policy to quickly
achieve an integrated and sustainable progress in the fight against
corruption. Under the methodological guidance of the NATO expert
team, we will periodically analyse the self-assessment of corruption
risks in the ministry. The standing Committee on Anti-corruption will
work in close cooperation with the Council of Ministers’ Centre for
Prevention and Combating Corruption and Organised Crime.

The Ministry of Defence’s information policy is aimed at raising
awareness and public support for the policy of the department and is
closely linked to government defence policy. Efforts are concentrated
on making the policy adequate to the rapidly changing global
information environment and the introduction of new technologies.
We will modernise the communication tools and approaches for the
successful implementation of information policy.

The defence policy is regularly presented to the public on
paper, through electronic media, digital information products and
messages to target groups, as well as through direct communications,
discussions and events, with the goal of building lasting relationships
and networks with audiences both inside and outside the institution.


-----

In the implementation of information policy, the Defence Minister
is assisted by the Public Relations Directorate. An important tool here
is the Information Centre in the Executive Agency “Military Clubs
and Military Recreation”, which is composed of the Military TV-
channel, the “Bulgarian Army” newspaper, the “Bulgarian soldier”
magazine, an audio-visual centre, a department for media monitoring
and analysis, as well as the military clubs’ information activities.
Those support the dissemination of current information about military
service and recruitment of professional soldiers.

The public relations structures of the different services of Armed
Forces are imperative for the success of the Ministry of Defence’s
information policy. They must be active in three main areas - media
contacts, insider information and links to local communities, while
coordinating their communication activities in accordance to the
information policy of the institution.

Sustaining the system for public relations with qualified personnel
is a priority and its implementation is crucial for an effective
information policy in the department. To this end, units are maintained
in the structures of the Armed Forces to ensure the functioning of the
public relations system.

The participation of contingents from the Bulgarian Armed Forces
in missions and operations outside our territory requires knowledge
of the patterns of intercultural communication and consideration
to the cultural specifics of allies, partners and the countries where
the operation is conducted. Effective public communication is
increasingly changing into intercultural communication, especially in
defence. This entails the need for specialised training of personnel
and staff in public relations.


-----

**7. CARE FOR THE PEOPLE IN DEFENCE**

**Social security and other social activities**

The main responsibilities set out in the Ministry of Defence’s
social policy are formed in accordance with the specifics of work,
the ensuing complexity from the execution of the tasks, and with the
increased health and life risks of personnel.

Much of this policy is linked to national legislation on employment,
social security and pensions. At the same time, a number of special
conditions are provided to assert the order of: salaries; ensuring quality
of life in the divisions; recreation and recuperation; social, health
and pensions insurance; providing education and qualifications; the
specifics for exemption from military service – all these conditions
give special status to the civilian and military personnel involved
with the state’s defence. The achievements in social insurance and
social activities will be maintained and efforts will be made for them
to positively develop in the future.

With regard to military personnel, we will keep the way in
which their basic salary is calculated. The military are paid extra
remuneration for: long service; specific conditions in the performance
of military service; risks to life and health that cannot be eliminated,
restricted or decreased; the performance of assigned duties outside
the established official time (working hours); education and degrees;
and high achievements and performance in professional activities.
Health insurance, including against death and disability resulting
from accidents in or in connection to their duties, are borne by the
state budget.

Upon the discharge of military duty, military personnel are entitled
to a single financial compensation, the total sum of which is equal to
a monthly salary for each year on duty and not exceeding a total of
20 monthly salaries. In case the serviceman has served 10 years and
more and is discharged as unfit for military service due to illness or
disability in or in connection with military service, the amount of the


-----

single financial compensation cannot be less than 15 gross monthly
salaries. But when the period is less than 10 years, the serviceman
is entitled to a one-time cash compensation amounting to 10 gross
monthly salaries. Military personnel are also entitled to a one-time
financial compensation in case of transfer, exemption from military
service and an average or severe bodily injury sustained during or in
connection with the performance of official duties.

To unemployed wives or husbands of soldiers participating in
international operations and missions receive a benefit equal to the
minimum wage established for the period of the operation or mission.
Such benefits are paid by the National Insurance Institute on behalf
of the state budget. The children of soldiers studying at primary and
secondary schools and in full-time education at university, in the
country and abroad, at the age of up to 26, are entitled to a scholarship
for the duration of the operation or mission. Its size is determined
by the Minister of Defence and the necessary funds are paid by the
Ministry of Defence.

People in defence with free negotiation terms housing receive
compensation sums. Furthermore, in order to meet the housing
needs of employees, a housing policy is conducted on a territorial
differentiation principle. Its essence is expressed in the construction
of housing on land owned by the Ministry of Defence.

The functional environment and nature of activities in the Armed
Forces require the creation of safe and healthy working conditions for
military and civilians personnel during their daily service. For this
purpose, we provide annual training to officials on health and safety,
who ensure compliance with work procedures to minimise accidents.

The Ministry of Defence will continue to provide welfare to
military and civilian personnel, retired military, and the disabled and/
or injured in connection to their work in defence. We have created the
necessary legal base and organisation for the provision of monthly,
periodic and gross sum benefits aimed at guaranteeing a certain basic-
minimum differential income. Financial aid is also available to meet
the costs of sickness, accident, prolonged unemployment, natural
disasters and accidents leading to loss of property, and other such
cases. Funds for these activities are planned for by the budget of the
Ministry of Defence.


-----

The Ministry of Defence will assist financially and materially
established legal entities for the public benefit, such as: military-
patriotic associations; non-governmental organisations active in the
field of security and defence; as well as associations of soldiers,
reservists, war veterans, soldiers injured/disabled on duty.

In order to ensure a successful transition of discharged military men
into the civilian society, the Ministry of Defence builds and maintains
a system of social adaptation through guidance, motivation-training
courses, preparation for starting personal business, career advice and
job assignment help.

The funding of the mentioned courses is done by the institution,
where the person is entitled a scholarship of 70% of the fee, paid
from the budget of the Ministry of Defence, and 30% paid on his
behalf.

The vacations of civilian and military personnel of the Ministry
of Defence are organised by the Executive Agency “Military Clubs
and Recreation”. People in defence can take advantage of organised
vacations and recreation in military resting homes and hotels. Ten-
day vacations are organised for the children of civilian and military
personnel. Moreover, annual vacations are organised under duty-free
exchange and within the framework of cooperation in the Liaison
Committee of the social structures of the ministries of defence of
NATO countries.

A free seven-day vacation in the military rest homes is provided
to military personnel having partaken in operations and missions
outside the country and to their families. Ten-day free vacations are
also organised for soldiers and sergeants in those missions, including
for their family members. Every year, free vacations in the military
rest homes are sent to children of military personnel members who
gave their life during or in connection to their military service. The
same vacations are also granted to war veterans, disabled and injured
military personnel.

The vacations and excursions follow the social agenda of the
Ministry of Defence and 50% of the required funds are financed by
the “Social and Cultural Service Fund”, within the approved yearly
budget. All employees working in the Ministry of Defence have equal
rights to the opportunities provided for recreation. The exception is


-----

with military personnel involved in operations and missions outside
the country – in that case they and their family members benefit of
more advantages.

**Medical Support**

Under the current legislation the Military Medical Academy is
responsible for the medical insurance of the Armed Forces.

The Military Medical Academy, respectively the Military Medical
Service of Armed Forces, is responsible for: the implementation
of primary outer and inner-hospital care; disease-prevention and
rehabilitation of soldiers, their families, civilian personnel and
civilians; determining aptness for military service; research of and
practical application to mental and psychological health; and the
selection of military and civilian personnel. Moreover it is entrusted
with specific tasks to develop and implement models for medical
care in situations with large numbers of wounded and sick; to
protect the Armed Forces and population from nuclear, chemical
and biological effects; conducting military-medical and medical
training and specialisation; training for professional qualifications;
military health monitoring and control of transmittable diseases.
An important task is also contributing in operations abroad
Military contingents. Its responsibility is to develop concepts,
strategies and programme-plans in the area of medical insurance,
to achieve interoperability with forces of other NATO member
states. The role of the Military Medical Academy is defined by the
inclusion of specialists (in surgery, orthopaedics and traumatology,
anaesthesiology, resuscitation and other fields of expertise in the
Academy) in teams working in military hospitals with international
participation, for medical coverage of NATO missions. This is of
great importance when it comes to our national contribution to
allied operations.

To implement these tasks, the Academy is constituted of multi-
profile hospitals for active treatment, rehabilitation hospitals, and
specialised centres for nuclear, chemical and biological protection,
psychological treatment, military hygiene, epidemiology and
other fields. An important element of this structure is also the


-----

Military-Medical Rapid Response Force, which performs tasks
in preparation of military-medical experts for participation in
missions and the maintenance of a “Role 2” field hospital, to
secure mechanised brigade action in operations. In eliminating the
consequences of extreme situations, this squad performs tasks of
a national character. Members of the Military Medical Academy
include departments that perform tasks in educational research.
Outer-care of military personnel from the Ministry of Defence and
the Bulgarian Army is carried out by unified medical posts in the
services of the Armed Forces.

In accordance with the Review, we are to modify the Military
Medical Academy. This involves optimising and changing the
structures, and increasing the capacity to meet the needs associated
with the reorganisation of the Armed Forces, within the budget for
the 2010-2015 period. In connection with likely scenarios for the use
of forces, special attention is given to the development of NATO-
standard field medical capabilities for the troops’ participation
in operations and missions abroad. This is reflected in personnel
building and assembling with modern means and appropriate medical
field units (Role 1 support for battalion/division), which can establish
medical-diagnostic levels and medical-preventive and psychological
assistance. The number of such units is expected to be 90 and the
ones in the mechanised brigades will be fully equipped for field
deployment in missions. Reducing the number of fixed beds in two
hospitals of the composition of the Military Medical Academy, as
well as the reduction the hospitals’ personal staff by 225 positions, is
also planned.

Shortage of qualified medical staff in the formations of the Armed
Forces demands a change in national legislation and establishing the
new medical profession of “Sanitary Instructor” (or “Paramedic”) to
become the backbone of the medical day-to-day and on-field support
to troops. It is planned for their training to be conducted in the
structures of the Military Medical Academy.

Their role will include: optimisation of the psychological security
of military areas; assisting commanders in the direction of building
and maintaining an optimal psychological climate in military units;
the assessment of mental resources and of the potential of applicants
for military service; recognition and control of professional and


-----

combat-stress and risky behaviour; developing and conducting
psychological training modules to improve key competencies
(leadership, communication, teamwork, stress control, etc.); personnel
psychological counselling; crisis intervention psychotherapy at the
individual, group and organisational levels.

**8. IMMEDIATE CHALLENGES AND TASKS**

**What immediate challenges do we face?**

**What urgent tasks do we need to undertake?**

By the end of 2010 we have to develop a “Armed Forces
Development Plan”. The core of this plan will be the roadmap for
implementing the results of the Force Structure Review. It will
contain specific actions with deadlines for implementation and clearly
allocated responsibilities. Its main role will be to achieve a balance
between tasks, available resources, the size and the capabilities of the
Armed Forces.

The plan focuses on building a single set of forces with balanced
capabilities across all components, to address the entire spectrum of
tasks arising from the developed scenarios and the analyses of the
military-strategic security environment and its progression.

At the start of 2011, the Armed Forces Development Plan will be
followed by Long-Term Investment Plan.

With the gradual implementation of the roadmap we aim, by the
end of 2014, to achieve the optimal allocation of the Defence budget
for on-going maintenance personnel and investment.

We believe that to achieve this objective, as well as the successful
realisation of the single set of forces, it is necessary to ensure a
relatively constant share of GDP to the MOD budget over the next
four years, no less than 1.5%, but with the inclusion of other defence
costs and military pensions - 2%.

An essential condition is the reinvestment of managed restructuring
savings in the defence system. The fulfilment of this condition will
require changes in the legal framework within which the defence
system operates.

Other significant changes in legislation will be initiated in late
2010, when we will introduce to the National Assembly the Law on


-----

Military Police for discussion and adoption and in early 2011 the
Law on Reserve Forces.

By mid-2011 we will carry out a restructuring at the strategic level
(integrated Ministry of Defence) and in operational structures (Joint
Operational Command and the headquarters of the Armed Forces) in
strict compliance with the “top – down” principle.

The restructuring of tactical units (brigades and bases) will be
launched in the second half of 2011 and will continue until the end
of 2012.

In this context, 2011 and 2012 appear to be years in which we,
the people in defence, will work under great pressure. We know that
the very words “transformation” and “restructuring” have already
developed a negative meaning. People feel tired and uncertain after
surviving years of supposed “military reforms”. Thus a great challenge
ahead of us is be to keep the motivation of men and women in defence
and to preserve the core of invaluable experience, knowledge and
skills they possess.

**What lies ahead in the long run?**

The building of the Armed Forces and development of defence
capabilities with very limited and insufficient financial resources,
a dynamic military environment with asymmetric threats, the
accelerating pace of using formations in operations away from the
country – all of this logically leads to the momentous prioritisation of
forces and means intelligence, surveillance and early warning, of the
command and control system, of forces for immediate response, and
of special operations forces.

It is essential to create battle-capable maneuvering formations both
to partake in security operations and to contribute to collective defence.
The priority remains the provision of necessary resources for Bulgarian
forces abroad, for the execution our military duty at home, in the air,
at sea and on land. Consequently, we will proceed to ensure the forces
declared for NATO and the European Union, and the preparation for
the planned participation of our military formations in operations with
realistic objectives in line with our resource options.

The presence of a strategic vision is very important for all aspects
of public life, but particularly in security and defence. The sharp
comprehension of strategic objectives allows for the formation


-----

of priorities, approaches, the commitment of resources to tasks,
consequent accountability. Most importantly, it assigns responsibility
to the execution of objectives – answering to what extent the clearly
defined goals accepted by society have been achieved. So, looking
forward to the future, we can say that with this White Paper the vision
of the Armed Forces as a whole is changing.

**9. CONCLUSION**

We present to the attention of the National Assembly and the
Bulgarian public the White Paper on Defence and Armed Forces as
the main programming document of defence policy. Reaching the
last page of the White Paper, we hope you have been convinced of
one thing – the determination and clarity with which we intend to
implement the measures envisaged in our government’s policy and to
achieve the desired outcomes in face of the challenges posed by the
strategic environment and our limited resources.

Bulgaria will continue to build its security by implementing the
mechanisms of NATO’s collective defence and the Common Security
and Defence Policy of the European Union. As a member of NATO
and the European Union, our country undertakes its proper share in the
efforts to create a security environment conductive to the realisation
of our national interests, of peace, stability, justice and economic
prosperity.

It is commonly known that we are faced with the constraints of
deficient resources for several years ahead. A priority in this situation
is to keep the existing capabilities necessary to the Armed Forces, to
develop capability components that do not require significant financial
resources, to guarantee the constitutional duties of the army, to use a
single set of forces and to provide an adequate contribution to Allied
operations.

At the same time, society best perceives the outcome of efforts
made by observing the difficult and beset with many risks daily
round of the men and women in uniform. Involved in operations or
fulfilling their military duty at home, saving people and their property,
buried under snow, inundated by flood waters or standing in the way
of spontaneous fires – Bulgarian soldiers carry out their tasks in an
unpredictable, hostile and threating to life and health environment.
They have the need to feel your approval and support, not only
through the high poll ratings, but in unity of purpose, expectations
and the confidence of the Bulgarian people in their army.
