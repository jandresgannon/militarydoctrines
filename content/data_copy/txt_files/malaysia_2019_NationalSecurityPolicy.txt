**1.    INTRODUCTION**

1.1   Malaysia is a multi-racial country adopting a system of government based on

parliamentary democracy with a constitutional monarchy. The nation is built on
integration of its people, territorial integrity, a stable government, sovereignty and
international recognition.

1.2 The Government is responsible for ensuring that sovereignty and national security
are continuously safeguarded and maintained. In this context **Malaysia’s**
**national security refers to a state of being free from any threat, whether**
**internally or externally, to its core values.** Threats to national security since
1957 such as the Communist Party of Malaya insurgency, incursion by the
terrorist army of the Sulu Sultanate into Sabah in 2013, efforts to overthrow the
Government through non-democratic process, militancy and terrorism as well as
global threats in various forms have necessitated the formulation of a
comprehensive National Security Policy (NSP).

1.3 The NSP is introduced as the principal policy in confronting the various security
threats which have become increasingly dynamic and complex. Through the NSP,
the implementation of the primary strategies will ensure that National Core
Values are safeguarded thereby keeping Malaysia safe from all forms of threat,
not only physical but also non-physical, that which may influence and corrupt
people’s minds. This includes interference by foreign powers in the
administration and internal affairs of the nation.

1.4 In this sense, the formulation of the NSP as the primary guide and reference for
federal and state ministries and agencies is proof that the Government is
persistently committed in ensuring that national security is assured and
maintained. Consequently, the support and cooperation of the people is
detrimental in guaranteeing the survival of Malaysia as an independent, safe and
sovereign nation based on the principles of parliamentary democracy and
constitutional monarchy. Not only is the NSP intended for the society in-being
but more importantly, for the well-being and peace of generations to come.

**2.    NATIONAL SECURITY POLICY STATEMENT**

2.1  The NSP is the overarching policy or basis for comprehensive national security

aimed at maintaining, safeguarding and defending the National Core Values
which will ensure the survival of Malaysia as an independent, peaceful, safe and
sovereign nation.

2.2  The NSP was formulated under the National Security Council Act 2016 [Act 776]

which confers power to the National Security Council in formulating policies and
strategies for national security. This responsibility includes the monitoring of the
implementation of such policies and strategies.

**3.    MALAYSIA IN THE GEOSTRATEGIC CONTEXT**

3.1  Malaysia has a strategic position in the South-East Asian Geo-political environment.

Geographically, it is also located along important Sea Lines of Communication,
namely, the Straits of Melaka and the South China Sea which have frequently
attracted the attention of the major powers. Malaysia’s location influences its
bilateral and multi-lateral relations with other countries, both regional and
international, in terms of important political, socio-economic, security, defence,

cultural interests amongst others. In addition, Malaysia’s security is influenced to
a larger degree by regional and international geopolitics in the following premise:

**Regional**

3.1.1  ASEAN is the primary focus in Malaysia’s foreign policy. As one of the founder

members of ASEAN, Malaysia fully supports and upholds the basic principles
contained in the ASEAN Charter such as the opposition in the use of force, nonintervention in the affairs of member countries as well as the promotion of
peaceful conflict resolution as the key to ensuring peace, stability and prosperity
in the region. This commitment is aimed at maintaining national strategic
interests.

3.1.2  Malaysia also fosters regional strategic cooperation through active participation

in regional security and defence organisations such as the ASEAN Regional
Forum (ARF), ASEAN Defence Ministerial Meeting (ADMM) and Five-Power
Defence Arrangement (FPDA) to safeguard national interests.

**International**

3.1.3  Countries such as the United States of America, China, France, Russia, United

Kingdom, Japan, India, Australia and the European Union (EU) have strategic
interests in Malaysia and the region. These countries are important because they
have the power to shape the global political and economic environment militarily
as well as the economic and technological edge to broaden their political influence
and pursue their respective interests.

3.1.4 Malaysia’s commitment to international organisations such as the United Nations

(UN), Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), Non Aligned Movement
(NAM), Commonwealth, G-15 and G-77 in handling global strategic issues has
resulted in it being regarded as a friendly nation to be trusted and respected at the
international level. Through active participation in the international organizations,
Malaysia’s policies and interests on numerous security issues have been
highlighted and maintained. Over and above that, its participation in
Peacekeeping Operations and post conflict rehabilitation in various countries
affected by war, internal conflict and natural disasters have also acknowledged
Malaysia’s role and empathy as a global player. The selection of Malaysia as one
of the non-permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, and as
chair of associations such as the OIC, NAM and G-77, among others, manifests
Malaysia’s role at the global level by the international community.

**4.    NATIONAL SECURITY ENVIRONMENT**

4.1   Malaysia has undergone a challenging evolution in maintaining its sovereignty,

national security and public order. The current security landscape has become
increasingly complex with threats from both State and Non-State actors which
will have high impact on the security and sovereignty of the nation. Past
experiences faced by the nation in relation to security includes colonisation by
foreign powers, the Communist insurgency, the Indonesian Confrontation,
secessionist movements, the 13 May 1969 ethnic conflict, extremism (ethnic,
ideological, religious and political), economic crises, natural disasters and
territorial infringements. Measures to ensure national security and the survival of
Malaysia as a sovereign state needs to take cognizance of both internal threats and
the geopolitical climate at regional and international levels as follows:

4.1.1  Fragility of National Unity

Issues that touch on communal sensitivities, ethnicity, religion, beliefs and
culture which are widely and freely disseminated in the social media
continue to be a source of communal friction in Malaysia. These issues
continue to hinder the country’s aspiration in creating a united and
progressive society.

4.1.2  Challenges Facing the Nation’s Democratic System

There are efforts and schemes to bring down the Government through nondemocratic process which violates the laws of the country. Such actions
will weaken our national institutions which will threaten public order and
the security of the nation.

4.1.3  Illegal Immigrants and ‘Refugees’[1]

The peace, prosperity and rapid economic growth enjoyed by the country
has attracted the influx of illegal immigrants and ‘refugees’ to our shores.
The presence of illegal immigrants and ‘refugees’ not only creates
negative impact on the social, economic, criminal, political domains and
diplomatic relations, but also has the potential to threaten the peace and
security of the nation.

4.1.4  Disputes over Territorial Claims

Malaysia has been facing the issue of overlapping territorial claims and
disputes over land, maritime and air territories with its neighbours as well
as major powers. These disputes have the potential to adversely impact
bilateral relations between Malaysia and its neighbours. At the regional
level, overlapping territorial claims can spark the risk of armed conflict
leading to regional collateral ramifications and potentially invite the
intervention of interested third parties if not handled appropriately.

4.1.5 Extremism and Terrorism

The issue of international terrorism is an ongoing global threat that has a
direct impact on the security of Malaysia. Extremist and terrorist elements
that have infiltrated the country as well as the involvement of Malaysian
citizens in terrorist activities both within and outside the country can spark
chaos and threaten the peace of the country.

4.1.6  Cyber Security

The inception and rapid development of Information and Communication
Technology (ICT) has increased our reliance on technology thereby
aggravating the risk of cyber security threats. The open borderless
dimension of cyber space with easy access and availability as well as
anonymity has also increased the risk of cyber-attacks on the nation’s
Critical Information Infrastructure, abuse of the internet, cyber espionage

1The use of this terminology in this document does not mean that Malaysia accepts the concept of refugee as defined
in any document regarding refugees including the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees 1951 and Protocol
_Relating to the Status of Refugees 1967._


The peace, prosperity and rapid economic growth enjoyed by the country
has attracted the influx of illegal immigrants and ‘refugees’ to our shores.
The presence of illegal immigrants and ‘refugees’ not only creates
negative impact on the social, economic, criminal, political domains and
diplomatic relations, but also has the potential to threaten the peace and
security of the nation.

**Disputes over Territorial Claims**

Malaysia has been facing the issue of overlapping territorial claims and
disputes over land, maritime and air territories with its neighbours as well
as major powers. These disputes have the potential to adversely impact
bilateral relations between Malaysia and its neighbours. At the regional
level, overlapping territorial claims can spark the risk of armed conflict
leading to regional collateral ramifications and potentially invite the
intervention of interested third parties if not handled appropriately.

**Extremism and Terrorism**

The issue of international terrorism is an ongoing global threat that has a
direct impact on the security of Malaysia. Extremist and terrorist elements

and other related transgressions. The present trend of cyber-attacks and
cyber security incidents have been in the rise and increasingly difficult to
predict.

4.1.7  Disasters

Malaysia is exposed to the dangers and risks of natural disasters such as
floods, typhoons, storms, outbreak of infectious diseases and epidemics,
earthquakes, tsunami, droughts/El Nino, landslides, haze and the impact
of climate change such as increase in sea levels, air and land temperatures
as well as those that are human induced. Disasters. These travails are
complex and of great magnitude occurring, within or beyond our shores,
will adversely impact the lives of the people and inhibit the smooth
running of the Government.

4.1.8  Crises

Malaysia is vulnerable to various types of crises, both internally and
externally, including economic and social crises as well as armed conflict.
Such crises have a direct impact on the people which will adversely affect
national security. External crises can trigger unmitigated migration to
other countries including Malaysia.

4.1.9 **Transnational Crime**

Malaysia’s geographical location sharing vast land borders with its
neighbours and positioned along Sea Lines of Communication, namely.
the Straits of Melaka and the South China Sea, is vulnerable to
transnational crimes such as smuggling (of people, wildlife, jungle
products, drugs, goods and arms), human trafficking, piracy, organised
crime, cybercrime, money laundering, economic crimes and armed
robbery at sea.

4.1.10 Pandemics and Infectious Diseases

Global and internal population mobility which has been enhanced and
afford rapidity has exposed Malaysians to health concerns. Pandemics and
the spread of infectious diseases whether emanating internally or
externally can have adverse effects on the nation’s socio-economic
wellbeing. Non-infectious medical conditions such as hypertension,
diabetes. kidney infections, heart diseases and the likes, if left unabated
will eventually bankrupt the nation.

4.1.11 Energy Security

The world today is facing uncertainties in energy security. Reliance on
traditional fossil energy sources is estimated to increase until alternative
energy sources that are cleaner and less expensive are utilised extensively.
However, at present, a scramble for fossil energy sources may occur, and
trigger regional and international conflicts.


Malaysia is vulnerable to various types of crises, both internally and
externally, including economic and social crises as well as armed conflict.
Such crises have a direct impact on the people which will adversely affect
national security. External crises can trigger unmitigated migration to
other countries including Malaysia.

**Transnational Crime**

Malaysia’s geographical location sharing vast land borders with its
neighbours and positioned along Sea Lines of Communication, namely.
the Straits of Melaka and the South China Sea, is vulnerable to
transnational crimes such as smuggling (of people, wildlife, jungle
products, drugs, goods and arms), human trafficking, piracy, organised
crime, cybercrime, money laundering, economic crimes and armed
robbery at sea.

4.1.12 Food Security

The survival of a nation is also dependent on food security. World
population growth has led to an increased demand for food sources.
Failure to manage existing sources well will lead to competition over
limited sources and create overdependence on external supplies.

4.1.13 Proliferation of Nuclear Arms and Arms Development Programmes

The nation is also exposed to nuclear threats including the use of nuclear
weapons. The easing of controls and pressure on nuclear programs and the
development of Weapons of Mass Destruction by State actors, particularly
the major powers, as well as the risk of accidents in nuclear plants can
have disastrous consequences. This includes grave ramifications on the
health of the people in the vicinity, marine life and the environment. The
development of Weapons of Mass Destruction remains a major threat to
peace in the region.

**5.** **MALAYSIA’S CORE VALUES**

5.1 Malaysia’s core values are required to be maintained, preserved and strengthened
in order to guarantee its survival as an independent, peaceful and sovereign
nation. These core values are as follows:

5.1.1 Core Value 1: Territorial Sovereignty and Integrity

Territorial sovereignty and integrity are paramount to the stability and
security of a nation. The creation of Malaysia comprising the states of
Johor, Kedah, Kelantan, Melaka, Negeri Sembilan, Pahang, Penang,
Perak, Perlis, Sabah, Sarawak, Selangor, Terengganu and the Federal
Territories, as enshrined in the Federal Constitution, must be maintained
and preserved. Malaysia’s sovereignty also extends to its territorial waters
as it enjoys sovereign rights to its maritime zones in accordance with the
relevant international laws. Malaysia needs to protect and defend its
sovereignty and territorial integrity from both internal and external
threats.

5.1.2 **Core Value 2: Socio-Political Stability**

Socio-political stability is vital to creating a peaceful and harmonious
environment for the people of Malaysia. The Government is responsible
for upholding parliamentary democracy, constitutional monarchy, the rule
of law, sanctity of the Constitution, as well as respect for and guaranteeing
of human rights based on the Federal Constitution. At the same time, the
people are responsible for supporting the policies implemented by the
Government to ensure peace and stability in the country. These principles
must be respected and adhered to by all Malaysians irrespective of their
political beliefs, religion, ethnicity, origins or social status.

5.1.3  Core Value 3: National Integration

Malaysia is a multi-ethnic, multi-cultural and multi-religious country.
National integration is core to the strength and security of the country. It
can be achieved through the bonds that unify all Malaysians. The formula

Johor, Kedah, Kelantan, Melaka, Negeri Sembilan, Pahang, Penang,
Perak, Perlis, Sabah, Sarawak, Selangor, Terengganu and the Federal

relevant international laws. Malaysia needs to protect and defend its
sovereignty and territorial integrity from both internal and external
threats.

**Core Value 2: Socio-Political Stability**

for unity in a country with a plural society such as Malaysia thus depends
on the various communities coming together to live with mutual
understanding, tolerance, acceptance of diversity, understanding of the
social contract that underlines the unity of the people and respect of
human rights based on the Federal Constitution.

5.1.4 Core Value 4: Good Governance

Good governance is fundamental to national security. It concerns not only
the Government but also the private sector. This is because good
governance will enable a country to implement the policies that have been
formulated, manage the resources of the country efficiently and
effectively, gain international recognition and fulfil the expectations of
the people. Good governance incorporates, among other things, high
integrity, absence of corruption, honesty, trust, justice, equal rights,
transparency and responsibility.

5.1.5 Core Value 5: Economic Integrity

Economic integrity means the country has a sustainable and resilient
economy that can weather any internal or external economic threat. An
economy that is weak will impact the stability of the country as a
consequence of poverty, unemployment and dissatisfaction in the society.
Economic integrity also encompasses the participation, acquisition,
involvement and efforts of all Malaysians towards ensuring the economic
survival of the country. Furthermore, a strong economy combined with
improvements in social conditions is a contributory factor towards the
enhancement of national security as a weak economy has the potential to
threaten national security.

5.1.6 Core Value 6: Social Justice

Social justice is vital to ensure national security is preserved. The
protection of basic human rights for every Malaysian citizen is
championed in accordance with the Federal Constitution and international
laws which Malaysia is party to (with reservations). All Malaysians, even
those from minority groups, must be protected and no party should be
excluded. This core value must be protected in accordance with the
Federal Constitution by taking cognizance of the differences in the socioeconomic status of any particular ethnic group. Thus, Government
policies and provisions in the Federal Constitution which have granted
special rights for groups needing them will continue to be honoured.
However, the principle of social justice should not be the launching pad
for any party to make excessive claims which can then threaten the
security and sovereignty of the country.

5.1.7 Core Value 7: Sustainable Development

Sustainable development is one which fulfils present as well as future
needs so as to achieve a balance in economic, social, demographic and
environmental development. Security must be given priority in any
development plan to ensure the sustainability of the nation’s resources,
people’s prosperity and fulfilling the needs of future generations. Unequal
development may lead to an ecological and demographic imbalance.


**Core Value 5: Economic Integrity**

Economic integrity means the country has a sustainable and resilient
economy that can weather any internal or external economic threat. An
economy that is weak will impact the stability of the country as a
consequence of poverty, unemployment and dissatisfaction in the society.
Economic integrity also encompasses the participation, acquisition,
involvement and efforts of all Malaysians towards ensuring the economic
survival of the country. Furthermore, a strong economy combined with
improvements in social conditions is a contributory factor towards the
enhancement of national security as a weak economy has the potential to
threaten national security.

5.1.8 Core Value 8: People’s Security

The proliferation of ideas as well as the global security environment has
brought about the transition from a state-centric security to a peoplecentric security approach. The prosperity, welfare and rights of Malaysian
citizens entrenched in the Federal Constitution must be protected and
guaranteed by the Government. At the same time, the nation’s rights must
also be embraced and upheld by the people with full patriotic fervour and
the sense of responsibility towards national security and sovereignty.

5.1.9 Core Value 9: International Recognition

The pragmatic, principled and neutral attitude adopted by Malaysia has

thus far gained recognition and afforded continued economic, political and
security cooperation from the major powers, both regionally and
internationally. Bilateral and multilateral diplomatic strategies that are
comprehensively formulated, supported by the implementation of a
consistent foreign relations policy since independence, have created a
positive image for Malaysia at the international level, and avoid
interference from foreign powers in its administration and internal affairs
as well as guaranteed the continued recognition of its sovereignty and
interests.

**6.** **PRIMARY STRATEGIES**

In order to maintain and protect the National Core Values, several key strategies would

necessitate implementation. These strategies are as follows:

6.1 **Strategy 1: Uphold the Federal Constitution**

Enhance appreciation and respect for, as well as upholding the principles in the
Federal Constitution for the interest of national stability and prosperity.

whether maritime, land or air, by all means including its legality, conduct
surveillance and patrol over the disputed areas to ensure territorial integrity and
to prevent the loss of such territories in future should matters be brought for
international adjudication.

6.4 **Strategy 4: Enhance Defence and Security Capacity and Preparedness**

Enhance defence and national security through capacity building and
preparedness. This empowerment is to balance the capacity to defend and
maintain regional security and act as a deterrent against foreign intervention of
the country’s affairs. The defence industry as well as defence and security


consistent foreign relations policy since independence, have created a
positive image for Malaysia at the international level, and avoid
interference from foreign powers in its administration and internal affairs
as well as guaranteed the continued recognition of its sovereignty and
interests.

**7.** **CONCLUSION**

7.1   Regardless of the forms of changes in the domestic, regional and international

security landscape in the future, the Government must ensure that national security and
survival are assured by implementing the policies and strategies embodied in the NSP. In
this sense, the NSP outlines the outlook of national security which is linked to both
internal and external environments. In order to achieve this aim, the Government has to
preserve the fundamentals enshrined in the Federal Constitution as well as ensure that the
nation embrace universal values (human rights). The core values of the NSP have been
formulated holistically by taking into consideration an essential elements of a state, being
territory, government, people, sovereignty and international recognition.

7.2  The implementation of the NSP will be monitored and reviewed every three (3)

years by a coordinating committee at ministerial/departmental/ agency levels which will
be chaired by the Director-General of National Security to ensure the effectiveness of the
strategies embodied in the NSP.

7.3 The success of the NSP would depend on the commitment, support and

cooperation of every federal and state ministry, department and agency, the private
sector, Non-Governmental Organisations and the people. Thus, the NSP must be adhered
to in formulating, coordinating and implementing national policies which are directly or
indirectly related to national security.


territory, government, people, sovereignty and international recognition.

7.2  The implementation of the NSP will be monitored and reviewed every three (3)

years by a coordinating committee at ministerial/departmental/ agency levels which will
be chaired by the Director-General of National Security to ensure the effectiveness of the
strategies embodied in the NSP.

The success of the NSP would depend on the commitment, support and

cooperation of every federal and state ministry, department and agency, the private
sector, Non-Governmental Organisations and the people. Thus, the NSP must be adhered
to in formulating, coordinating and implementing national policies which are directly or
indirectly related to national security.
