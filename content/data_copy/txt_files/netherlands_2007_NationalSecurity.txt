#### Foreword

### SECURITY
 IS EVERYONE'S CONCERN!

Security is the cornerstone of a society in which people feel free, at ease and

connected. In our densely populated country, disasters can all too easily

acquire a snowball effect, with all the ensuing societal consequences. Ironclad

guarantees of perfect security can never be offered. But a great deal of

suffering and damage can be prevented through thorough analysis of possible

threats, well-defined prior agreements and a clear division of tasks.

Strengthening national security is a task for the national government. But a

safe and secure living environment in the Netherlands requires everybody’s

involvement: from government in all its various forms and levels, but also

from the private sector and civil society. Many threats can furthermore only

be countered in cooperation with our international partners.

In order to be optimally prepared for various threats, the Cabinet has drawn up

this national security strategy. It puts the roles and responsibilities of all

parties involved in a coherent framework. Central to this strategy is a joined-up,

whole-of-government approach to our national security. An approach that

will ensure that everything necessary is done to safeguard the status of the

Netherlands as a country in which people can live and work with their hearts

and minds at ease. Security is everyone's concern. This strategy shows how,

together, we can provide this goal with form and substance.

J.P. Balkenende

Prime Minister

### SUMMARY

Threats to our security are changing and becoming ever more intertwined.

Relatively minor threats can through increasing interdependencies lead to

societal disruption. Answers to existing and new threats can therefore no

longer be formulated and implemented by a single ministry or organisation.

We need an integrated and coherent approach that can look beyond current

threats. Planning and policy should no longer be primarily based on individual

(known) threats, but on the extent to which overall national security is or can

be threatened.

In order to realise this approach, the Cabinet has drawn up a national

security [(*)] strategy. The aim of the strategy is to protect society and citizens

within Dutch territory against internal and external threats. Our national

security, however, cannot be viewed in isolation from the security of other

countries, in particular those of our European partners and NATO allies. This

also explains why internal security policy, which this strategy mainly deals

with, and Dutch international security policy are so closely linked.

National security is jeopardized when vital interests of the Dutch state and/or

society are threatened to such an extent that one can speak of – potential –

societal disruption. The following vital interests have been defined: territorial

security (threatened through breach of territorial integrity), economic security

(undisrupted trade), ecological security (living environment), physical security

(public health) and social and political stability (e.g. respect for core values

such as freedom of expression).

Using the working method described in the strategy, the Cabinet will be better

able to determine which threats endanger our national security and how to

anticipate those threats, irrespective of their origin or nature. In addition, the

method not only enables the Cabinet to make better substantiated choices in

determining priorities and acting upon them, but also to view these choices in

their relationship with each other.

While new, the working method makes use of existing, more sector-oriented

processes; these come together in the working method, thus enriching

information and insights and increasing knowledge. Use of the working

method should obviously not lead to duplication of existing processes.

From 2009 onwards, the working method will be applied across the full range

of national security issues. The period up to 2009 will be used to roll out the

working method. The introduction in stages is described in the 2007-2008

work programme.

(*) In this document and in the working programme, the term ‘national security’ encompasses both security and
safety. The term ‘national security’ is discussed in detail in chapter 2.


-----

The working method will generate a strategic (long-term) foresight report

every two years, the yearly selection of threat themes requiring in-depth

analysis and a twice-a-year government-wide horizon scan of shorter-term

threats. This scan will result in the report 'Threat Assessment Netherlands'.

Moreover, once a year the results of the national risk assessment will be

presented in the report 'Risk Assessment Netherlands'.

In order to make this possible, the working method starts by analysing the

threats facing the Netherlands, assessing those threats in terms of risks to the

vital interests and positioning these risks vis-à-vis each other: the national risk

assessment. The Cabinet will then decide which risks will be prioritised for

detailed treatment in the strategic planning stage. At that stage, the method

will determine which capabilities the government would require to deal with

the prioritised risks and which capabilities it already possesses and/or can

expect from external parties, such as the business community, social

organisations and international organisations. The Cabinet will then decide

whether, and if so where and how, national security must be strengthened. The

political/administrative choices will then be translated into policy, legislation

and concrete measures.

The development of the choices made by the Cabinet is not only in the hands

of the national government. Other public authorities, the business community

and social organisations also play a role. In order to enable an integral

approach, all parties involved must know and respect each other's role in

strengthening national security, follow a shared doctrine, align their working

methods to each other and be connected to the same communication network.

In 2007 the Cabinet will come up with concrete proposals for optimizing the

aforementioned aspects of authority and control by the government in the area

of national security.

Another essential component of the integral approach is the structural

exchange of knowledge and information and alignment between the public

and private parties – both in a national and an international context – who play

a role in protecting national security.

As many threats to national security do not originate in our territory but can

have consequences here, a purely national approach will not suffice. Countries

are dependent on each other if they wish to increase their resilience.

International cooperation, both at bilateral and multilateral level, is vital for

reinforcing national security. The Cabinet is going to put security topics that

require an international approach on the agenda. Wherever relevant, it will

work in an international context to generate the capabilities deemed necessary

to withstand threats. European programmes will also be leveraged to this aim.

The goal of the Cabinet is to intensify the relationships with countries that use

similar working methods to guarantee national security.


-----

#### Introduction

### 1 WHY DO WE NEED THIS STRATEGY?

**_Our society is vulnerable. We see this when we are confronted with threats like_**

**_bird flu, climate change and terrorism. The answer to existing and new threats_**

**_cannot be formulated by one ministry or organisation alone. Reinforcement of_**

**_national security requires a joined-up, integral approach within which_**

**_international cooperation is an essential element. The strategy describes how the_**

**_Cabinet is going to realise this approach._**

National security is under threat when vital interests of our society and/or state are threatened in

such way that it leads to (potential) societal disruption. The term 'national security' is discussed in

detail in Chapter 2.

**_Reason for the strategy: more diffuse threats, greater consequences_**

SARS, bird flu, floods, terrorism; these are examples of threats which have

demanded more and more attention in the last few years and which have made

us realise our (increasing) vulnerability. Developments which threaten our

country are changing and are increasingly becoming more closely entwined.

Think of the connection between climate change and pandemics, or between

ICT fallout and an interrupted energy supply. While many of these threats do

not originate from the territory of the Netherlands, they can most certainly

have consequences here. This limits our options for independently

counteracting these threats: an exclusively national approach is often not

sufficient. The rise in sea levels is an obvious example of this.

The report by Sir Nicholas Stern, Adviser to the UK Government, shows that climate change does

not stand alone, but also has consequences for the health of humans and animals, the economy,

migration flows and concomitantly the gap between rich and poor [1] A World Economic Forum

report also concludes that threats are interrelated. This report emphasises the importance of an

integral approach in order to be able to withstand threats.[2]

-----

Moreover, the impact of disruptions is increasing. This is because over the past

few decades Dutch society has become more complex and dependent on

critical systems, such as ICT technologies. We see this as soon as something

goes wrong. In addition, because of the greater population density, crises and

disasters are more likely to result in a large number of casualties.

Naturally governments and private parties are already active in strengthening

security. In order to be able to effectively direct these efforts, now more than

ever cooperation is needed between all organisations that are responsible for

national security: national government, local authorities, social organisations

and the business community. An approach that guarantees integrality and

coherence across security sectors is essential.

That is why the Cabinet has decided to establish a government-wide security

strategy. Other countries, such as Germany, Finland, and Canada, have already

developed such a strategy or are working on one. As international cooperation

is necessary for reinforcing national security, it is important to have a national

reference framework. This strategy primarily concerns the internal aspects of

Dutch security policy.

_Finland: 'Finnish Security and Defence Policy 2004' (Prime Minister’s Office: Publications 18/2004)._

**Strategies of other countries**

_Germany:_

Zentralstelle für Zivilschutz, Bonn-Bad Godesberg, 2003).

_Finland:_

_Canada:_


**_Goal: more coherence in the approach to national security_**

The Cabinet wants to reinforce national security by means of a coherent

approach. The strategy describes the working method for realising this

approach; a working method which, moreover, makes it possible to deal with

(continually) changing risks. The integral working method enables the Cabinet

to make better substantiated choices as to what risks are to be reduced and for

what priorities the scarce (financial) resources have to be used. This strategy

does not indicate the most important priorities, but describes the working

method for defining these priorities. In addition, implementation of the

working method can provide insight into new opportunities for reinforcing

national security. These could include new technologies that can make the

Netherlands safer.

The choices made by the Cabinet then form a guideline for actions by

ministries, local government, the business community and social

organisations. In this way a joined-up approach to national security emerges.

Moreover, the choices which are made determine the Dutch contribution to

international cooperation.


-----

Much has already been put in motion (and realised) in the area of (national)

security. Examples include: the intensification of civil-military cooperation

(ICMS); the establishing of the National Terrorism Prevention Coordinator

(NCTb); the public anti-terrorism campaigns (such as the '200,000

professionals' campaign); protection of the critical infrastructure; the crisis

management policy plan 2004-2007; the National Crisis Decision Making

Manual; the revitalisation of the National Plan for the Prevention of Nuclear

Accidents; the Security, Cooperation and Reconstruction Steering Group;

the Reassessment of the ICT Security Policy project; the security regions Act;

the individual responsibility publicity campaigns (such as the 'Think Ahead'

campaign); the Interdepartmental Consultation on Energy Supply Assurance;

the National Defence Doctrine; the Flood Management Taskforce (TMO) and

the Government and Evacuations project.

The national security working method gives direction to these programmes

and projects: results of the working method, e.g. analysed threats and

prioritised risks, are the starting point for the various programmes and

projects and planning cycles of, e.g., the security regions. Conversely, all of

these programmes provide building blocks which can be used in components

of the working method to reinforce national security. Regional risk inventories

serve as input for the working method, for example. This interaction enables

cross-sector cooperation, charts interdependencies and brings about

information sharing. This results in an integral approach to national security.

Strategic Operational

Reinforcement of national security focuses on the entire security chain – from pro-action and prevention, via
preparation to response and after-care – and is strategic in nature. The national security working method gives
direction to the protection of the critical infrastructure and crisis management. Moreover, these topics are geared to
one or more links in the security chain: with critical infrastructure the emphasis is primarily on prevention (measures
for better security of the critical sectors), while with crisis management, the emphasis is on preparation (preparation
for incidents), response (if an incident has occurred) and after-care.


-----

The strategy wants to offer the fullest possible protection against breaches of

national security but cannot exclude the possibility of breach. After all,

absolute security is an illusion, also in today's world. The strategy makes the

Netherlands more resilient in the event its national security were to be at risk.

Moreover, the working method enables the government to communicate

clearly on the possibilities and impossibilities of strengthening national

security.

**Work programme 2007-2008**

Partly based on experience abroad, the Cabinet recognizes that development time is required to

introduce the working method. The introduction in stages is described in the work programme

2007-2008'. Commencing in 2009, the working method will be applied across the full range of

national security issues. A work programme will then be drawn up periodically.

**_Structure of the strategy document_**

Chapter 2 defines the term 'national security'. What is its scope? Chapter 3

first presents the working method for reinforcing national security in the form

of a diagram; after that the components (from threat analysis to follow-up) are

detailed. Chapter 4 discusses the role division in the execution of the working

method. Finally, Chapter 5 reviews what the Netherlands can do in an

international context.


-----

#### Definition

### 2 WHAT DOES
 NATIONAL SECURITY MEAN?

**_The strategy is geared to preventing societal disruption. Vital interests, core_**

**_values and various types of threats are distinguished._**

National security is at stake when vital interests of our state and/or our society

are threatened to such an extent that it might lead to societal disruption.

National security encompasses both breach of security by intentional human

actions (security) and breach due to disasters, system or process faults, human

failure or natural anomalies such as extreme weather (safety).

This strategy is concerned with the protection of society and people within the

nation's own territory against internal and external threats. Naturally there are

direct connections between national security and international security. In the

Netherlands' foreign policy, promoting national security is therefore of

tremendous importance, even as other interests and objectives also play a role,

such as striving for a just and fair world order and solidarity among allies.

**National security as a concept in Dutch and European regulations**

The concept 'national security' already exists in our regulations. For example it is used to define

the working area of the information and security services. The scope of the concept is primarily

determined in the WIV 2002 by the additional description of the activities of these services in the

task articles themselves[3].

In the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms

(ECHR), the term national security forms one of the target criteria which justify an infringement

of a number of fundamental rights. The term national security is not defined as such in the ECHR

or in the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights. However, the jurisprudence

does include a number of cases in which it is accepted that national security was at issue.

The interpretation of the term is broad: national security is delineated by what can be deemed

necessary in a democratic society.

The term national security in the ECHR lies at the basis of the identical term in the bill of the

National Security Administrative Measures Act.[4] The term is not given a rigid delineation in the

bill either; it must not be given too restrictive an interpretation. The latter point also applies to

the term national security which is included in the Aliens Act 2000.[5]

**_Protecting vital interests_**

The goal of the strategy for national security is to protect the vital interests of

the Netherlands in order to prevent societal disruption. These interests are

also explicitly used in the risk assessment method that will be described in the

following chapter.

The five vital interests are:

**_1. Territorial security_**

The undisrupted functioning of the Netherlands as an independent state, and

more specifically the territorial integrity of our country. The territorial integrity

is at risk in the event, for example, of a threatened occupation of the state

territory by another state, but also in the event of a terrorist attack.

**_2. Economic security_**

The undisrupted functioning of the Netherlands as an effective and efficient

economy. For example, economic security can be breached if trade with an

important foreign partner is lost.

**_3. Ecological security_**

Sufficient self-recovery capability of the living environment in the event of

breach. Ecological security can be at risk due to, e.g., disruptions in the

management of the surface water, but also due to climate changes.

**_4. Physical security_**

The undisrupted functioning of humans in the Netherlands and its (living)

environment. Physical security can be under pressure if, e.g., public health is

threatened by an epidemic, but also if there is a major breach of the dikes or

an accident in a chemical factory.

**_5. Social and political stability_**

The undisrupted continued existence of a social climate in which groups of

people live together without major conflict within the framework of the

democratic state and shared core values. Social and political stability can be at

risk if changes occur in the demographic structure of society (for example

solidarity between generations), social cohesion and the degree of participation

of the population in social processes.

The five interests are entwined; breach of one can lead to breach of other

interests. For example, breach of the physical security (the fourth interest) can

put pressure on the fifth interest: social and political stability. At the same

time, this interest can also be directly threatened. By breach of social cohesion,

for example. The degree of social cohesion is the result of the binding power of

the core values of Dutch society. Breach of these values is the same as breach


-----

of the core of Dutch society. In protecting vital interests, the context within

which justice can be done to these values has to be safeguarded.

But protection of national security also affects these core values in a different

way. For example, freedoms and rights (such as privacy) can be at risk due to

policies aimed at reinforcing national security. In that sense there is a

dilemma: the protection of vital interests for society demands policy, while that

same policy can affect the core values for individuals and groups in that

society. When applying the working method for national security a balance

must be found in this respect too.

**What are the core values of Dutch society?**

The core values of our society are worded in the report 'Waarden, normen en de last van het

gedrag' (Values, standards and the burden of behaviour) of the Scientific Council for

Government Policy (WRR)[6]. First of all, these are the values of the democratic state, such as:

-  equal treatment and the prohibition of discrimination

-  freedom of religion and belief

-  freedom of expression

-  freedom of association, meeting and demonstration

-  respect for privacy

-  integrity of the person

A number of social values which are necessary for a properly functioning democratic state also

fall under the core values. Think of, inter alia, truthfulness, empathy and sympathy for others,

respect for the opinion of others and willingness to modify one's own opinion, but think also of

social skills such as flexibility, responsiveness and sense of responsibility, a certain pragmatism

and being able to bear uncertainty and ambivalences.

**_Protection against threats_**

At present, nine threats have been identified which can lead to societal

disruption (see the box below). But what is a threat at present may well have

been neutralised in a few years. And what is latent now can be transformed

into an acute danger in the near future. Moreover, account must be taken of

threats which are not (yet) currently foreseen. It is therefore necessary to have

a working method which offers a counterbalance to 'the craze of the day'.

The working method therefore looks beyond threats: planning and policy are

no longer based on specific (known) threats, but the degree in which national

security is or can be threatened is taken as the point of departure. 'Looking

beyond threats' presumes an approach whereby the borders between sub-areas

of national security (which have been demarcated between ministries, local

governments and other organisations) become blurred, thus preventing

that topics are dealt with twice over or, worse still, end up not being discussed

at all.

6 See the WRR report 'Waarden, normen en de last van het gedrag', Amsterdam University Press, Amsterdam, 2003.
7 In 2005 there was an interdepartmental inventory of proactive government policy to prevent societal disruption. Nine threats
were identified which can lead to societal disruption. Each threat was then sub-divided into a number of incident categories.


-----

**Threats and incident categories**

This overview is subject to change: the application of the working method which is described

in Chapter 3 can lead to new insights.

**Threats** **Incident categories**

**_'Classic' threats_**

1. Breaches of international peace and -  failing states
security [8] -  risk countries

2. CBRN (chemical, biological, radiological, -  distribution of CBRN weapons
nuclear)

3. Terrorism -  catastrophic terrorism

-  radicalisation

4. International organised crime -  increasing connection between the

legitimate and the criminal world

-  worldwide trade in drugs

**_Social-economic threats_**

5. Social vulnerability -  increasing (inter-ethnic) tensions and

decreasing sense of citizenship

-  radicalisation[9]

6. Digital lack of security -  digital paralysis

7. Economic lack of security -  extreme scarcity of energy carriers and

raw materials

**_Natural threats_**

8. Climate change and natural disasters -  increasing risk of flooding

-  increasing risk of extreme drought/heat

-  plague organisms

9. Outbreak of infectious diseases and -  pandemics of known human diseases
animal diseases -  viruses which can be transmitted from

animals to humans

8 The breach referred to here can also be the result of civil wars and regional wars.
9 Radicalisation in its most extreme form can lead to terrorism, but also threatens social cohesion in Dutch society
without an act of terrorism being required. This explains why radicalisation has been classified under two categories.

#### National security working method

### 3 HOW TO ACHIEVE
 REINFORCEMENT?

**_The working method for reinforcing national security consists of three stages: (1)_**

**_a government-wide analysis of threats and assessments of risks (what is coming_**

**_the Netherlands' way?), (2) strategic planning (does the Netherlands have the_**

**_requisite capabilities?) and (3) follow-up (how and where will national security be_**

**_reinforced?). This working method enables the Cabinet to make well-founded_**

**_political and administrative choices and to set priorities for policy (-making)._**

**_Finally, a government-wide application results in a common language for_**

**_national security._**

**_3.1_** **_The working method set out in a diagram_**

The working method for reinforcing national security (see Figure 2) is a

continual process. The working method consists of:

**• Stage 1: analysis of threats and assessment of risks**

In order to protect the vital interests as best as possible, it is important to

continually possess a clear picture of potential threats. The working method

therefore starts with an analysis of the threats facing the Netherlands, an

assessment of the threats in terms of risks to vital interests and a weighing

of these risks vis-à-vis each other. At the end of this stage, The Cabinet will

decide which risks are prioritised for detailed follow-up in the strategic

planning stage.

**• Stage 2: strategic planning**

In this stage the government determines which capabilities it would require

to deal with the prioritised risks and which capabilities it already possesses

and/or can expect from external parties such as the business community,

social organisations and international organisations. The Cabinet will then

be given advice on, inter alia, the following questions: where is the

government going to deploy resources (and where is it not) and in what

stage of the security chain? The acceptability of choices is also considered.

**• Stage 3: follow-up**

Here, the political-administrative choices are developed into, e.g., policy,

legislation and concrete measures.

Per (component of a) stage, the government will weigh which (parts of) reports

are to be made public. The guiding principle is the greatest possible degree of

openness.[10 ]

Twice a year, the Cabinet will be informed or asked to make decisions.

The three stages are explained in the paragraphs below.

**_3.2_** **_Stage 1: Government-wide analysis of threats and assessment of risks_**

In the first stage of the working method, a distinction is made between

analysis and assessment. During the analysis, known and new threats will be

identified and detailed. An integral analysis of threats will, moreover, improve

sensitivity to early and weak signals. The chance or probability factor is then

added in the risk assessment: risk = chance x effect.

The analysis is based on three time-horizons: long term (from approx. 5 years),

mid term (up to approx. 5 years) and short term (up to approx. 6 months). This

changes the perspective of the analyses from exploratory (long term), to policy
based (mid term) and action-oriented (short term).

In the analysis and risk assessment, use is made of existing, more sector
oriented procedures; these are merged to enable an integral approach.

Knowledge is shared, both by domestic and foreign government organisations,

the business community and the academic world. This results in a broadening

and deepening of this knowledge. It also allows the Netherlands to learn from

the experience of others, and to more effectively share knowledge and

information (internationally).

It is important for the Cabinet that the analysis and assessment process is

objectively reviewed in order to guarantee its quality. The Cabinet is

considering engaging (international) persons and institutes who will not

execute the analyses and assessments themselves, but who do have expertise

which is comparable to that of the parties which do carry out the analyses and

assessments (peer review).

**_Strategic foresight (long term)_**

The goal of strategic foresight is to determine which (new) threats require

further investigation with regard to their consequences for national security.

Account is taken in this respect of such things as, e.g., geopolitical

developments.

The foresights first of all provide insight into new threats that can influence

national security in five years or more. In addition, they signal possible trends

in known threats. Use is made in this respect of knowledge that is available at

10 The limits of the openness are determined by, inter alia, analogy with Article 10 of the Open Government Act. .


-----

national and international level regarding possible future situations and the

threats ensuing from these for national security. Sources include publications

of planning offices and advisory bodies, and studies by, e.g., universities,

the business community and international organisations[11]. Cross-analyses are

made of these various sources.

Every two years, the Cabinet receives the result of this effort in the form of a

report, 'Strategic Foresight on National Security'. On the basis thereof the

Cabinet will determine for what (new) threats further research is required.

The outcome determines the agenda for the thematic analyses and risk

assessment in the mid term. Certain developments can in the long term form

such a serious threat to national security that policy measures must be

considered. Think of the consequences of climate change. Within the strategic

planning it will then be researched what policy measures are required.

**_Thematic in-depth study (mid-term)_**

This component of the working method leads to the most complete possible

picture of known and new threats that can have consequences for national

security within a term of up to 5 years.

A thematic approach makes it possible to establish links between different

perspectives. This enables the topic of climate change to be approached from

the perspective of extreme weather (floods, drought) but also from the

perspective of infectious diseases and animal diseases (pandemics, zoonoses).

The thematic in-depth study also results in extra knowledge on existing and

new threats.

The results of the thematic in-depth study can differ in form: they can be

scenarios for the mid term (for example: how will social tensions manifest

themselves in Dutch society?) but can also be identified trends.

**_Horizon scanning (short-term)_**

This component leads to reinforcement of the signalling function for concrete

threats to national security in the short term (within about six months).

Signals of possible threats are shared in a timely fashion (e.g. by using

(existing) alarm systems) throughout the government, so that the responsible

parties can take cohesive measures, taking each party's individual

responsibility into account. In this manner short-term horizon scanning

contributes to the reinforcement of the collective approach to possible threats.

Moreover, events today can give rise to strategic discussions about the

organisation of the Netherlands in the long term.

Short-term horizon scanning will, twice a year, result in a report titled 'Threat

Assessment in the Netherlands'.

11 Such as the Central Bureau of Statistics, the Social Cultural Planning Bureau, the Environmental and Nature Planning
Bureau, the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment, the Scientific Council for Government Policy,
the Council for Urban Planning, the Environment and Nature Research and the Council for Social Development.


-----

**_National risk assessment_**

Analysed threats are then measured on one yardstick in accordance with a pre-

agreed model. The risk assessment has an all hazards approach. Scenarios for,

e.g., floods, pandemics and long-term fallout of utilities and for incidents of an

intentional nature are described in a clear manner, substantiated with figures

and weighted. In this manner the risks for national security become

comparable.

Assessment is carried out a) of the likelihood that a scenario will occur and b)

what its impact will be, particularly on the vital interests as described in

Chapter 2. The impact can be divided into an objective component (e.g.

disruption of essential supplies, material damage, number of victims) and a

subjective component (the psychological effect on the population, and, e.g., the

public outrage aroused by an - imminent – event). The perception factor is

thus explicitly considered in the risk assessment.

Annually the results of the national risk assessments are published in a report,

'Risk Assessment in the Netherlands'. The risk prioritisation determines

which risks are going to form part of the strategic planning (see Stage 2).

**_3.3_** **_Stage 2: strategic planning_**

The decisions of the Cabinet following the risk assessment form the starting

point for the strategic planning process. The goal of this stage of the working

method is to provide insight on the extent to which the Netherlands can

withstand the prioritised risks. Strategic planning considers the entire security

chain in this respect.

**_The capabilities-based approach_**

The strategic planning relies on a capabilities-based approach, also known as

capabilities based planning (CBP). This approach is not geared towards one

specific threat or risk. Rather it focuses on what is necessary to prevent the

consequences of threats or risks as much as possible (prevention) and/or to be

prepared (preparation and response). It is a flexible approach: tasks and

capabilities can be used in this approach to withstand various threats.

**Background of the capabilities-based approach**

The capabilities-based approach derives its rationale from the increased diversity in the threat

picture. The changing and more diffuse threat picture was cause for the Ministry of Defence to no

longer work with specific threats, but to base defence planning on the CBP method. Countries like

Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia apply this method in the realisation

of their strategic security policy; internationally the capabilities-based approach is seen as a tried-

and-tested method to anticipate diverse threats government-wide, across sectors and flexibly.


-----

The capabilities-based approach entails that the government takes the

prioritized risks emerging from the national risk assessment and:

**• determines, with the help of planning assumptions, which tasks it has to be**

able to perform to deal with that risk;

**• reviews what capabilities it requires to be able to execute those tasks (the**

desired situation);

**• establishes which capabilities it already has (the current situation);**

**• compares both situations and identifies gaps or redundancies (doing the**

same thing twice).

**Examples of tasks and capabilities of the national government**

The capability approach does not assume a one-on-one relationship between threats, tasks and

capacities. The execution of one task may be necessary for various threats. A 'large-scale

evacuation' for example, will have to be executed in the event of both a nuclear accident and a

flood. In the same manner a capacity can be used for tasks ensuing from various types of threats.

Think of the emergency drinking water supply capability which can be used in a breach of the

quality of drinking water as a result of an ecological threat, but also as a result of a terrorist attack.

Another example of a capability is having a model allowing for upscaling; with regard to crisis

decision making, this is recorded in the National Crisis Decision Making Manual.

When executing the strategic planning stage the focus is on the presence of

capacities at both the national and the decentralised level. The current

structure of (preparation for) crisis management at local and regional level is

taken as the starting point in this respect. Third party resources can form part

of the 'national potential' to respond to a specific threat.

**_What does the strategic planning stage give us?_**

The results of the strategic planning stage will allow the Cabinet to decide

whether a reinforcement of capabilities is required in view of the prioritised

risks, and if so, in what areas and at what stage of the security chain. This

reinforcement can be the responsibility of a specific department or of parties

outside of the (national) government, but also of the country as a whole

(e.g. a national reserve of resources to combat a pandemic). Strategic planning

also allows for the identifications of crosslinks, not only within the

government but also between the government and the parties outside of the

government; this enables available resources to be used effectively.

The Cabinet makes choices about how national security is reinforced: by

developing or intensifying policy, adjusting the statutory instruments or by

taking concrete measures. The need for reinforcing national security is always

weighed up against the consequences thereof for other interests, e.g. the rights

of individuals. In addition, the proposed measures and policy intensifications

must be in proportion to the goal, both with regard to effectiveness and

efficiency. In other words, the proportionality of the measures to reinforce

national security is explicitly included in the consideration.


-----

Strategic planning provides insight into how the tasks could be optimally

divided between national government, other authorities, social organisations

and the private sector. In some sectors, private institutions are responsible for

safeguarding continuity and offering an adequate response to all sorts of

possible threats. One example of this is the telecommunications sector.

Strategic planning is an instrument for clarifying and optimising the

combined action between these parties; it systematically brings people,

resources, plans and procedures together and clearly sets out what people can

expect from each other. In addition, this creates a common frame of reference.

**_3.4_** **_Stage 3: follow-up_**

Decisions made in the Cabinet on the basis of the strategic planning stage are

used by the public and private institutions which have to work out these

decisions. They do this within existing plans and policy cycles geared to

reinforcing national security, such as protecting the critical infrastructure and

the crisis management policy plan. Moreover, the realisation is linked to the

regular budget cycle. The chapter below discusses the roles played by various

players in the reinforcement of national security.

**_Ambition_**

_As of 2009 the working method must be fully operational. This implies that:_

_• (long term) strategic foresight is carried out every two years from the perspective of national_

_security;_

_• annually topics are chosen which require in-depth analysis from a mid-term perspective._

_These topics are in part determined by the results of the strategic foresight;_

_• annually there is national risk assessment in which all relevant risks for national security_

_are assessed using the same model;_

_• the results of this risk assessment are used for strategic planning of tasks and capabilities;_

_• twice a year a government-wide short-term horizon scanning is executed, whereby possible_

_short-term threats are exchanged between the parties involved and in which any measures_

_for an adequate collective approach are aligned to each other;_

_• strategic planning is systematically used in the course of 2008 to answer the question_

_whether the government is adequately prepared for a diversity of threats. Toward this end,_

_the capabilities-based approached will be worked out in further detail as a planning_

_methodology in 2007-2008;_

_• the Cabinet makes substantiated political and administrative choices to reinforce national_

_security on the basis of the outcomes of the strategic planning stage._

#### Role division

### 4 HOW TO REALISE THE STRATEGY?

**_The direction for reinforcing national security is in the hands of the national_**

**_government. But other public and private parties also contribute. In order to be_**

**_able to act effectively before, during and after a crisis, agreements are necessary_**

**_regarding authority and control. For example, think of a quick exchange of_**

**_information via the same communication network._**

**_4.1_** **_Role of the national government_**

Security is everyone's concern. The national government, local governments,

the business community, social organisations and citizens all make a

contribution toward reinforcing national security. The national government

directs these activities to safeguard national security.

Within the national government, the guiding principles of role division are as

follows:

-  the national security programme is an interdepartmental responsibility

whereby existing responsibilities are not affected, e.g., with regard to foreign

policy[12];

-  a programme manager is responsible for implementing and assessing the

national security strategy. The programme manager also monitors the

coherence of execution. Overall coordination is in the hands of the Ministry

of the Interior and Kingdom Relations;

-  the programme manager is supported by a highly interdepartmental

secretariat. The programme secretariat encourages the involvement of

national and international parties (public and private), coordinates the

political decision-making process and facilitates the government-wide

working method to reinforce national security;

-  for every substantive topic it will be stipulated what department has primary

responsibility;

-  placement on the Cabinet agenda goes via an interdepartmental and

ministerial portal in which all policy areas are represented that are necessary

to do justice to the all-hazard approach.

12 This relationship is mentioned explicitly as national security also has direct areas of interface with foreign policy,
which of course remains the responsibility of the Minister of Foreign Affairs.


-----

**_4.2_** **_Authority and control_**

National security cannot optimally be provided without clear agreements on

authority and control. The authority prior to and after the end of a crisis has

other characteristics in this respect than control during a crisis.

**_Authority prior to and after the end of a crisis_**

The preventative efforts in the framework of national security are aimed at

preventing societal disruption or the recovery of the consequences thereof.

The emphasis lies on solving major policy issues. Very many actors play a role

in this respect. Think of often diffuse conglomerates of interested parties, such

as citizens (whether or not organised in action groups), business community

and administrators. In addition, there is a complex field of responsible

authorities and institutions. In order to weigh up interests and find a solution

with all actors, the goal is consensus, after which the responsible parties will

make a decision. Authority in this stage is primarily geared to the development

of policy. There must be consensus on the areas of national security concern

that are taken into consideration. Also think of setting conditions that the

policy development for national security must satisfy.

**_Crisis control_**

If a breach of national security occurs or is at risk of occurring the situation

changes. In this stage there is a lack of time; immediate action must be taken,

without delay. Moreover, there are usually insufficient people and resources to

manage the situation. That is why priorities have to be set. A consideration is

also made in this respect regarding the use of force. Quick information

exchange, validation and analysis of information and the management of large

quantities of information are crucial to adequately controlling the situation.

In case of a crisis, it is vital that messages do not conflict with each other.

Toward this end it is necessary that communication between regional and

national government and between the relevant sector and the relevant ministry

takes place within a closed system.

The procedure in case of response is of a completely different nature than

those in the other stages. After all, a consensus model is impossible during a

crisis. An unequivocal control concept will have to be developed for the

coordination of information provision and other activities.

**_One procedure for authority and control at all stages_**

Despite the different characteristics, all stages of the security chain have one

procedure for authority and control. This procedure consists of four steps:

-  gathering and analysis of information;

-  processing information into proposals for decision making;

-  making decisions;

-  implementing decisions and supervising the execution.


of a crisis has

a crisis.


-----

Applying one procedure both prior to and during a crisis is of great

importance. In order to respond adequately during a crisis it is essential that

people who are involved in crisis management make use of the same work

routines as in the preceding stages.

**_Four principles of authority and control_**

In order to effectively go through the procedure of authority and control it is

necessary for all parties involved to have a single primary objective. This

means that they make a common and synchronised joint effort to reinforce

national security. In order to make this possible, it is desirable that all persons

involved support and apply the four principles described below.

_1. Clear role division and role consistency_

A clear role division of labour exists between the relevant parties and they also

stick to their roles. In other words: the parties are well aware of each other's

responsibilities and powers, and respect those, regardless of the stage of the

security chain. The control of the process will, by necessity, have a more

mandatory character in the response stage.

_2. Unité de doctrine_

All parties involved apply a common doctrine for all types of threats. This

doctrine contains a shared conceptual framework and regulates the

information exchange and the modular deployment of generic capabilities

which – depending on the nature of the threat – are necessary (for example

fire fighting, decontamination, crowd & riot control and evacuation).

_3. Working methods aligned to each other_

All public and private parties involved have aligned their working methods

with each other. A number of points are of special importance in this respect:

-  the decision-making procedures must be aligned with each other. This is not

only necessary to be able to quickly go through the decision-making

procedures with this many parties, but also to be able to apply technical

concepts for information exchange, such as network-enabled capabilities;

-  ensuring a common communication strategy for all parties involved;

-  synchronisation of planning: local, regional and national plans must be

aligned to each other. Plans of the private sector must also align to this;

-  on behalf of (multidisciplinary) operational deployment during a crisis, there

must be professional unity of command. This is partly necessary to enable

the modular deployment of generic capabilities;

-  adequate multidisciplinary action is promoted by regular joint exercises and

joint training where possible.


-----

_4. Uniform information network_

All parties involved must be connected to the same communications network.

This is both necessary for adequate information exchange and for the

application of concepts such as the aforementioned network enabled

capabilities.

**_4.3_** **_Role division with other parties_**

An integral approach to national security requires a clear picture of

international, regional and (semi-) private roles and tasks. In addition, it is

important to realise that all parties need each other as a result of the

increasing complexity of threats and interdependencies between sectors.

Analyses relating to critical infrastructure have made it clear that sectors are

dependent on each other: for example, ICT fallout or disruption of the power

supply can affect many sectors.

The results of the capabilities approach enable to explore the boundaries of the

role of (security) regions and (semi-)private institutions: what do they do

themselves, where should the national government facilitate and what are they

responsible for?

In some sectors, e.g. telecommunication, the business community has

primary responsibility for safeguarding continuity and responding to all sorts

of threats. Involvement by the national government starts from a

predetermined degree of disruption, whereby the relationship with national

security is examined, including possible effects on other critical sectors.

Companies often operate in an international context, e.g. as a multinational or

in an international industry association. But ministries are also internationally

active. And (security) regions at national borders often have contacts with the

neighbouring regions just across the border. Alignment, cooperation and

knowledge exchange between these parties is a prerequisite for effective

reinforcement of national security. Also here the four principles for authority

and control play an important role.

It must be continually questioned which scale is the most effective for the

intended reinforcement of national security: can the proposed approach be

found within the Netherlands or is international cooperation also, or

specifically, necessary - with neighbouring or nearby countries (e.g. bilateral or

trilateral alliances), at regional level (EU, OSCE), at transatlantic level (NATO),

global level (UN) or at several levels at the same time. It is conceivable that an

aligned approach at several levels simultaneously may be the most desirable

option: an ‘both-and’ approach.

Scale is also relevant within the Netherlands; for example, the security regions

better enable the municipalities to prepare for (new) threats. In addition,


-----

the security regions increase the administrative and operational effectiveness

of parties involved in regional contingency plans and crisis management: the

organisation of the fire brigade, medical assistance in the event of accidents

and disasters, contingency plans and crisis management are placed under one

effective regional administrative management. Unity, uniformity and

simplicity are thus achieved in this approach.

**_Ambition_**

_The national government cannot reinforce national security on its own; alignment and_

_cooperation with other parties in the public sector and between the public and private sector_

_are of great importance. The Cabinet has the following goals:_

-  all parties involved – public authorities, business community and social organisations –

_subscribe to and apply the principles of authority and control: knowing and respecting each_

_other's role in reinforcing national security, applying a common doctrine, aligning working_

_methods with each other and being connected with each other via the same communication_

_network;_

-  structural exchange of knowledge and information:

_• with umbrella organisations from the business community, such as the Confederation of_

_Netherlands Industry and Employers (known as VNO-NCW). Toward this end, the_

_Cabinet places security themes on the agenda which also require action by the private_

_sector. This form of alignment fits in with existing contacts between ministerial_

_departments and parts of the business community;_

_• within the public sector: horizontal (within the national government) and vertical_

_(particularly with the security regions)._

_In 2007 the Cabinet will make concrete proposals to optimise the authority and control by the_

_government in the area of national security._


-----

#### International context

### 5 WHAT CAN THE NETHERLANDS
 DO IN A WIDER CONTEXT?

**_National security requires international cooperation. As a member state of, inter_**

**_alia, the EU, NATO and the UN, the Netherlands aligns with and agrees with the_**

**_security strategies of international organisations. Our country utilises the_**

**_possibilities provided by bilateral, regional and global forms of cooperation._**

**_The Netherlands in the global community_**

National security cannot be safeguarded by national measures alone.

Continuing globalisation entails that developments occuring far beyond our

national borders can directly or indirectly affect our security. Moreover, there

are issues which can only be dealt with in an international context; just think

of climate change. The administrative levels at national, regional and global

echelon are interdependent. This interdependency requires intensive

international cooperation and alignment.

**_International cooperation is indispensable_**

International cooperation enables the Netherlands to influence developments

over which it has no control without such cooperation. This is possible by

means of bilateral (e.g. in the case of flood risk) or multilateral (e.g. in the case

of ICT security) agreements. The Netherlands can also provide substantive

inputs into the (national and international) security-relevant policy of

international organisations. The Netherlands underscores the importance of

international cooperation and will optimally utilise all possibilities it offers.

It will take an active stance in international organisations and forums.

**_Alignment with strategies of international organisations_**

As a member state of, inter alia, the European Union (EU), the United Nations

(UN), the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), and the Organization

for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the Netherlands is aligned

with and agrees with the security strategies of these organisations. Said

strategies particularly describe the possibilities of international cooperation

and the role that international organisations play therein, and leave scope for

the member states in the realisation of their own national policy to reinforce

security.


-----

**_Ambition_**

_Reinforcing national security requires that the Netherlands is continually aware that it is not_

_an individual player in this area and that threats cross borders. The national approach must_

_be aligned to that of other states and organisations._

_The Cabinet:_

_•_ _places security topics that require an international approach on the agenda. The results of_

_the national risk assessment and the strategic planning will be used toward this end;_

_•_ _assesses to what extent the capabilities requirement can be met internationally and how this_

_can be organised. As much alignment as possible is sought with existing international_

_initiatives._

_For example, in the response stage there are coordination mechanisms within both the EU_

_and NATO that enable the provision of international assistance in the event of a disaster or_

_crisis, thereby supplementing nationally lacking or limited capabilities;[13]_

_•_ _supports and utilises European programmes such as the European Programme for Critical_

_Infrastructure Protection (EPCIP) and the European Security Research Programme (ESRP)._

_This can prevent duplication in approach and lead to financial savings;_

_•_ _supports initiatives which strive to reinforce international cooperation and alignment;_

_•_ _structurally exchanges international knowledge and information and shares best practices_

_in the area of national security. The goal is an intensification of the relations with those_

_countries that apply comparable working methods for guaranteeing national security;_

_•_ _endeavours to realise solutions with individual countries which are deemed necessary to_

_reinforce national security. Solutions are being sought which simultaneously help to answer_

_international security issues. In this manner the Netherlands contributes to the reinforcement_

_of international cooperation._

### 1 GOAL AND STRUCTURE
 OF THE NATIONAL SECURITY
 WORK PROGRAMME 2007-2008

**_1.1_** **_Goal of the work programme_**

The national security work programme 2007-2008 will guide the

implementation of the working method as presented in the national security

strategy. This implementation requires an incremental approach. The working

method should be fully developed by the end of this work programme

(December 2008) and subsequently be applied to all national security issues.

In parallel with this development, the working method will already be tested in

the current environment.

Strengthening of national security requires an integral approach covering all

potential threats (all hazard), including the correlations between the various

threats. This entails an essential value added of the working method and

signifies the importance of a broad involvement of parties at national

government level as well as at regional and local levels, of international

organisations, and of stakeholders within the private sector, academia and

knowledge institutions.

In addition to broad stakeholder involvement, thorough analysis of the

national security environment also requires high quality input. Exchange of

information is a prerequisite for further enhancement/enrichment of

knowledge of that environment. This means that all potential sources and

capabilities will have to be exploited to achieve high-quality analysis results

and planning advice, including those available at think tanks, the business

community, and government, nationally as well as internationally.

The simultaneous and interacting development of the working method on the

one hand and the application thereof to specific themes on the other will

determine the quality of products to be delivered.

This dual objective of broad-based and high quality involvement emphasizes

the importance of the mobilisation of the (inter)national network relating to

national security. The work programme envisions the establishment of a

durable network at the end of 2008. The national security network serves to

establish relationships between existing activities of various national and

international partners and the activities of partners that are not yet included in

the network.


-----

**_1.2_** **_Structure of the work programme_**

The work programme consists of three parts.

1 The development and application of the national security working method

(Chapters 2 and 3). The working method is applied to three specific themes:

-  climate change;

-  polarisation and radicalisation;

-  energy supply assurance.

Furthermore, the method of strategic planning will be tested for the task of

mass evacuation to assess whether current capabilities are adequate to execute

this task or whether strengthening of capabilities is required.

2 The establishment of the (inter)national security network (Chapter 4).

3 The implementation of a number of programme activities (Chapter 5).


-----

### 2 CHOICE OF THEMES

**_2.1_** **_Rationale_**

The aforementioned themes have been placed on the agenda for the following

reasons:

-  providing relevance: these themes are currently high-profile and will

continue to require attention in the mid to long term[1]. Ongoing activities on

these themes can be exploited thus preventing redundancy of work and

reinforcing the outcomes of the analysis;

-  demonstrating the integral nature: these themes are multi-faceted,

reinforcing/demonstrating the potential value added of government-wide

strategic analysis and planning;

-  supported by relevant parties: these parties see an added value in choosing

these themes.

**_2.2_** **_Theme definition and description_**

At the conclusion of the current work programme the following will have been

accomplished for each of the three themes:

-  a government-wide analysis of these themes, yielding as comprehensive a

picture of the problem as possible: state of affairs, expectations, integral

effect analysis at different time-horizons plus a risk assessment to assess the

relative seriousness of the problems.

-  recommendations for the government-wide strategic planning as guidance

for political-administrative decisions on (additional) requisite capabilities.

**Theme: Climate change**

2006 saw the publication of many studies which concluded that climate change is a fact. For

example, the KNMI (Royal Dutch Meteorological Institute) published new climate scenarios in May.

In summary, expectations up to the year 2050 are for warmer summers and wetter winters. The

warm autumn of 2006 is a good example of this, as never before had an average temperature

increase of more than 1 degree Celsius been observed. In Al Gore’s movie (‘An Inconvenient Truth’)

and the recent study by the British scientist Stern (‘Stern Review: the Economics of Climate

Change’, 2006) it is, moreover, clearly outlined that while climate change in itself is not a threat, it

does trigger very diverse effects. These range from new developments in human and animal

diseases (a shift in the breeding grounds of the malaria mosquito and the tiger mosquito, the

emergence of bluetongue), changes in the distribution of wealth in the world (economic

consequences of climate change) to altered migration flows in the world.

1 See also the report ‘Global Risks 2007’, World Economic Forum, January 2007. This report identifies oil price shock/energy
supply interruptions, international terrorism, climate change and pandemics as the most important risks.


-----

The analysis will align with and build upon existing research and ongoing

projects such as the climate scenarios of the KNMI, effects of climate change

in the Netherlands of the Environmental and Nature Planning Bureau (MNP),

the Spatial and Climate Adaptation Programme (ARK), the Organisational

Preparation for Flooding Improvement Programme, the Taskforce for Flood

Management (TMO), Water Safety in the 21[st] Century (WV21), Ministry of

Health, Welfare and Sport Study on Climate and Health, the Dutch follow-on

study to the flu pandemic scenario of the World Health Organization (WHO).

For the short-term analysis the emphasis will be put on extreme weather (and

the related threat of floods, excessive heat/drought) and health (humans,

animals). For the mid term, a literature-based analysis will be carried out as to

whether all possible consequences of climate change have been charted. This

includes the impact of long-term developments in the mid term. On the basis

of these analyses a decision will be made whether specific topics require more

in-depth study. Incident scenarios relating to climate change will be developed

to be used for the national risk assessment. At this stage, currently existing

large-scale flood scenarios will be used: the high tide and floods scenarios

from the Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations, scenarios for

infectious diseases from the Ministry of Health, Welfare Sport and scenarios

for animal diseases from the Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality.

**Theme: Polarisation/radicalisation in society**

Polarisation and radicalisation processes among, in particular, Muslims and extreme-right youths

appear to be increasing in scale, speed and intensity. The AIVD (General Intelligence and Security

Service) writes in this respect: “The greatest current threat to the Dutch democratic legal order is

the existence of a broad social problem where in an atmosphere of frustration about the Dutch

‘multicultural’ society, inter-ethnic confrontations are being provoked by both sides of the ethnic

divide. Ongoing inter-ethnic confrontations can over time threaten the cohesion in Dutch society”[2].

Trends of polarisation are, in other words, at the very least just as great a threat to our country as

the possibility of a terrorist attack. The Institute for Security and Crisis Management (COT)

describes polarisation as “the sharpening of contrasts between groups in society that result or can

result in (an increase in) tensions between these groups and in risks for societal security and

security perception”[3]. Examples include increasing distance between groups, segregation, negative

image building and negative attitudes on both sides. Expressions that may reflect polarisation are

bullying, discrimination, vandalism, intimidation, racism and violence.

Occurrences of polarisation are closely related, but not identical to trends of radicalisation.

Radicalism adds a separate ideological and goal-oriented dimension. The AIVD describes

radicalisation as “the (active) striving for and/or supporting of far-reaching changes in society,

which can constitute a danger to (the continued existence of) the democratic legal order (goal), >>

2 ‘Annual report AIVD 2005’, p. 50, AIVD, The Hague, 2006.
3 ‘Handvatten voor gemeenten bij aanpak polarisatie en radicalisering’, COT, The Hague, 2006.


-----

>>

possibly with the application of undemocratic methods (means), which can negatively affect the

functioning of the democratic legal order (effect)”[4]. “Radicalism ensues from a mentality

characterised by thoughts and actions which are governed by an overriding ideal, belief, goal or

interest. Radicalisation relates to the growing willingness to personally strive for and/or support

the above-mentioned change, or to move others to do so”[5].

These characteristics indicate that the target group, motivation and (group) dynamics can, in the

case of radicalisation, differ from general polarisation processes and therefore demand a separate

approach.

Here too, the analysis will build upon ongoing projects such as the Action Plan

for Polarisation and Radicalisation 2007-2011[6] and the Social Unrest

Programme.

Scenarios will be developed for the mid term which will bring into view both

the causes and manifestation forms of polarisation and radicalisation.

Polarisation scenarios will be developed for the national risk assessment.

**Theme: energy supply assurance**

The focus within this theme lies on the assurance of electricity supply. Electricity is becoming

increasingly important to our modern society. Civilians, organisations, companies and government

have to a large extent grown dependent on the use of electricity. A guaranteed supply of electricity

is of vital importance yet subject to a range of potential risks. Recent examples of (relatively minor)

power outages, resulting in a temporary loss of electricity supply at local levels, show how

vulnerable the system can be. But how exposed is the system exactly, and what is the risk of

failures that could lead to large-scale societal disruption? There are also questions about the rising

demand for electricity. Is the Netherlands sufficiently prepared for this development? Is enough

being invested in expanding production and grid capacity? Electricity generation in the Netherlands

is largely dependent on the availability of raw materials such as natural gas and coal. This country’s

own gas reserves are gradually becoming depleted, making us increasingly dependent on imports

from third (partially non-Western) countries. What kind of risks does this entail for the future?

Finally, the safety and security aspects of (un)intentional human actions and (natural) disasters

have a major impact on this sector, and thus also on the many other (critical) sectors and

processes that are highly dependent on electricity.

It is therefore important to:

1. acquire good insight into the specific threats to security of supply of electricity in the short,

mid and long term;

2.to determine which of these threats form a risk that could lead to societal disruption.

4 ‘Van dawa tot jihad’, AIVD, The Hague, 2004.
5 ‘Aanpak polarisatie en radicalisering, CCV, Utrecht, 2007.
6 In terms of scale, national security has a national focus; the focus of the Action Plan is on (supporting) local
management. The national security programme provides insights into possible manifestation forms of polarisation
in the Netherlands, also in the mid to long term. With the aid of these insights, municipal authorities can prepare
themselves for dealing with (supraregional) risks. Execution of the Action Plan generates insights and information
about local threats and resilience, which form the input for the government-wide analysis as part of the national
security work method. Furthermore, the indicators used in the polarisation and radicalisation monitor (part of the
Action Plan) correspond with those used for analysis and risk assessment within the national security work method.

This analysis will build on ongoing processes such as the Protection of critical

infrastructure project, the Interdepartmental Working Group on Security of

Energy Supply and on foreign policy in general.

All three themes will benefit from knowledge-sharing and -building by

bringing together domestic and foreign government organisations, scientists

and private institutions with various perspectives. This will result in reports on

the state of affairs, the expected situation and effects (in the short-, mid- and

long-term) of the themes. The high-quality findings generated through these

analyses are expected to be of great value for the risk assessment, strategic

planning and for policy follow-up stages.

### 3 PRODUCT DESCRIPTIONS

The following products will be produced, partly on the basis of the agenda

themes.

**_3.1_** **_Strategic foresight_**

The first report ‘Strategic Foresight for National Security’ will be published in

2007. This report will outline long-term developments with potential impact

on national security. The report will identify and explore emerging themes

which may be relevant to national security because they can be threats in the

long term or opportunities which can be utilised to prevent threats.

This report will use inputs from forecasts and trend analyses conducted by

planning offices such as the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS), the Social

Cultural Plan Bureau (SCP), the Environmental and Nature Plan Bureau

(MNP), the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM),

and advisory bodies such as the Scientific Council for Government Policy

(WRR), the Council for Urban Planning, Environmental and Nature Research

(RMNO) and the Social-Economic Council (SER).

A think tank – consisting of leading experts from various fields related to

national security – will assess the national security implications of these

developments.

**_3.2_** **_Mid-term analyses_**

In 2007, analyses will be conducted to provide insight into trends and

developments in the mid-term. These analyses will be focused on the themes

of climate change, polarisation/radicalisation and energy supply assurance.

The goal is to enhance knowledge of these themes, to identify new threats, and

to unravel new correlations.

**_3.3_** **_National risk assessment_**

In 2007, the national risk assessment will provide a systematic comparison of

the various risk factors within the themes of climate change, polarisation/

radicalisation and security of energy supply that affect national security. Both

the probabilities of an event happening and its consequences will be considered.

For 2008, the ambition is to generate a national risk assessment across the full

spectrum of national security, resulting in the report ‘Risk Assessment in the

Netherlands’.


-----

**_3.4_** **_Short-term horizon scanning_**

In 2007 a report ‘Threat Assessment in the Netherlands’ will be prepared

which will at the very least pay attention to the themes of climate change,

polarisation/radicalisation and security of energy supply. As of 2008 the

‘Threat Assessment in the Netherlands’ will be prepared over the full range of

national security issues.

The report will provide an overview of the most important developments as

these have occurred during the preceding three months as well as a horizon
scan of the near-term future (what is coming the Netherlands’ way?).

A cross-analysis will take place between and across the various themes.

**_3.5_** **_Strategic planning_**

Based on the findings of the risk assessment, recommendations will be made

with the aid of planning assumptions as to whether capabilities must be

reinforced, and if so, which. The three themes placed on the agenda are

assured of attention in 2007 and 2008.

Also, advice will be given on whether or not to reinforce capabilities that form

part of the mass evacuation task. This is a more solution-oriented elaboration

of an already defined task in which the government and/or the business

community play a role. Completed at the end of 2007, this in-depth analysis

will result in an overview of current and desired capabilities in this area.

### 4 NATIONAL AND
 INTERNATIONAL NETWORKS

**_4.1_** **_National network_**

Building a national network will be an ongoing process. This process will build

on existing networks, but will also set up new networks. Knowledge and

information are to be exchanged on a structural basis and to be harmonised

with yet to be determined target groups, such as the umbrella organisations

within both the private and the public sector.

On the one hand, networks will be mobilised that pertain to the various

themes and tasks. With a view to the intended high-quality interaction between

experts, it is important not to ignore ‘original thinkers’ from adjacent

disciplines. On the other hand, additional efforts will be made to involve

experts at a level which goes beyond the themes. For reasons of support, a

communication strategy (including plan and activities) will be drawn up.

**_4.2_** **_International network_**

Information about the Dutch approach to reinforcing national security is

exchanged at the international level. To this end, an international conference

will be convened towards the end of 2007. In addition, bilateral expert

meetings are being organised in 2007 with existing international contacts.

This will provide an impetus towards a ‘community of best practice’ in which

specific knowledge and expertise in national risk assessment, analysis and

strategic planning can be exchanged with countries with a comparable

approach.

### 5 PROGRAMME ACTIVITIES 

**_5.1_** **_Authority and control_**

Concrete proposals for improvement in authority and control in the area of

national security will be made in 2007. In close consultation with strongly

involved public and private parties, the principles of authority and control as

laid out in this strategy will be fleshed out in further detail. The emphasis in

2007 will be on the applicability of these principles within the government.

More specifically, the applicability of authority and control principles will be

tested against one or more of the agenda themes and against the mass

evacuation task.

**_5.2_** **_Evaluation_**

An evaluation of the national security method will take place at the end of the

work programme. The findings of the evaluation will serve as a first step for

the follow-up programme of 2009 and beyond. In the evaluation, attention

will in any event be paid to:

-  quality of information, of the information exchange and of intermediary

products;

-  confidentiality of information (necessity and practical realisation);

-  clarity of role division and deployment of people;

-  practical use for follow-up;

-  added value of the working method with respect to current more sector-

oriented procedures (review against the starting situation);

-  impact (in time) of – components of – the working method on the regular

budget planning processes; relationship between strategic planning and the

so called VBTB (From Policy Budgets to Policy Accountability).

Evaluation can lead to adjustment (of components) of the working method in

order to reinforce national security.

**_5.3_** **_Quality and policy review_**

Finally, in 2007 a study will be carried out how to assure the quality of the

analysis and assessment procedure through peer review and the need for a

security impact assessment of new policy initiatives will be assessed.
