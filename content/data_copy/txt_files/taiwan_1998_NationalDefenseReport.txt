.

and The Ministry of National Defense ( MND ) publishes "the National Defense Report, Republic of China" in every other year .

It is designed to make public understand the national defense administration based on a transparent defense policy.

The paramount mission of the national defense is to fight against the force aggression from the outsider. Therefore, the consensus of "the threat to national security" should be first established, so as to unite the people in ROC as a whole and bring up the morale, too. However, as the evolution of the international security situation and the relationship between the Taiwan Straits, some people here in the Republic of China neglect the PRC's reiterate announcements, that she prefers to lose a large army to hold every pieces of the land, they also do not pay attention to the fact that the aim of the PLA's military training and exercise are using its military forces to invade Taiwan on the one hand, and on the other, they make groundless remarks that the PRC would not use its forces to invade Taiwan, or she is incapable of doing so; and even if the PRC would invade Taiwan by forces, the other nations such as U.S. would interfere to stop the aggression. As a matter of fact, with such a heedless concept, and regradless the reality, having the national security depended on other countries, they apparently jeopardizes the nation's existence to the extent as the PRC's invasion of Taiwan by force.

The national security is so related to the force threat that it should be carefully assessed, and should not be decided only by a wishful thinking. The ROCAF has adopted the strategy of "strong

defensive posture" and "effective deterrence" since the end of the
"Period of Mobilization and Suppression of National Rebellion" in May 1991. Furthermore, the MND time and again indicates that, it hopes the PRC will rationally assess the consequence of the armed conflicts between the Taiwan Straits and rule out the use of force, but obtained no friendly response yet. PRC insists not to rule out the "the use of forces to invade Taiwan" still, and continuously expand its military buildup. Undoubtedly, this is the greatest menace to our national security, and we would do our best to prevent the war. Besides, promoting the peaceful consensus and setting the regional security and cooperation organization is not only our objective, but also it is the action necessary to maintain our national security. But the security is based on the strength of an eternal truth. Therefore, only we could establish a defense force which could keep the ROC in secure, the ROC could obtain the most reliable guarantee, too. In view of this, even if we have no intention to make an arms race with the PRC, we can not be complacent with the new-generation force yet. Instead, we have to enhance the defense strength continuously, so as to avoid the armed conflicts and lead the Taiwan Straits toward a peaceful reunification .

The national defense affairs are complicated in nature, while the measure for reforms and renovation are greatly involved in the national security and people's benefits. Thus, they should be carefully considered as a whole, or it will mess up something because of mishandling, and make it too deal for a whistle. In order to make the people in every walk of life correctly realize the defense administration so as to support the national defense construction, the MND, in recent years, has held a number of seminars, face to face explaining those defense affairs suspicious a marka masa kana manda sa manan to the public, and does every effort to make the defense policy transparent. Becuase the exchange of opinions is limited only to the individual cases, some people are not fully aware of the whole situation due to lack of complete information. The "1998 National Defense Report, Republic of China" systematically explains the current national security environment, the national defense policy, and the national defense administration. It is in a hope that after wholly realizing the national defense administration, the people in different walks of life will fully support the national defense construction so as to maintain the national security .

and 1.

Becuase it is necessary for MND to gain the full public support, MND should make the public realizing the threat of national security, national defense policy, defense resources, and current situation of national defense. Therefore, we have designed this book only after carefully reviewed the comments and opinions from the public. The "National Defense Report 1998" is divided into 5 parts. National Security Environment and Military Situation, Defense Policy and the Armed Forces, Defense Resources and Management, Important National Defense Programming, the Armed Forces and the People.

The First Part - National Security Environment and Military Situation: Based on the current military situation of the PRC, describes facts and potential factors which affect ROC's national security. With various data and statistics, it also describes PRC's military diplomacy and military capablility to invade Taiwan .

The Second Part - Defense Policy and the Armed Forces:
To explain the defense policy and the Armed Forces of ROC,
including regular forces, reserve, military mobilization, and civilian defense mobilization. In order to make people in Taiwan appreciate the importance of "civil defense", it also contains a systematic description of ROC's civil defense system and its application.

The Third Part - Defense Resources and Management: It

contains mainly the manpower, material, and fund available to ROCAF. In order to enhance the correctness of provided data, experienced figures has been replaced by operating figures provided by responsible units. For example, the defense budget is no longer divided into "Military Investment, Personnel Maintenance, and Operational Maintenance " , number of the draftee is based on the statistics of authorized agency, etc.

The Fourth Part - Important National Defense Programming: To describe important defense programming in recent two years, and the issues which concerned the people most. In order not to duplicate information with the regular military press conference, this report contains mainly subjects such as organization adjustment of the Armed Forces, leadership and management of the fundamental units, combat readiness of the ROCAFs, and rights and benefits of soldiers.

The Fifth Part - the Armed Forces and the Public: To describe related defense measures which is concerned with people's rights and benefits, and the interaction between the Armed Forces and civilian people, such as property conflicts, military restrictions of construction, environment protection, etc.

National defense policy affects and interactes with other 2.

governmental administration a lot. Therefore, it must be carefully considered as a whole to truly realize the needs of ROC's national defense. In order to understand our defense policy correctly, one should not have any prejudice, and must have a deep acknowledgment from national security environment to defense policy and important national defense programming. In addition, all statistics' data in this book are

## G

taken from January 1, 1996, to December 31, 1997, except for defense budget taken based on Fiscal Year (FY), (from July 1, 1995, to June 30, 1997).

Defense policy is the guideline of protecting national security . It also has been serious considered for a long term. It should not be shifted unless the national interest, national object, or threat of national security were changed. Since the ROC
government announced to abolish the "Marshal Law" in 1991, and declared "not to use forces to unify China", the "strong defense and effectively deterrence" has been the highest guideline of ROC's military build up and remained unchanged since then. In order to reduce the length of this book and add newest data, theoretical and principle materials such as "the meaning of national defense," "the factors of making defense policy" has been simplified, but it doesn't mean any change in the said principle.

The newest generation weaponry equipment has been 4.

gradually entered into service for readiness after efforts we have has made for many years. It could support the strategic concept of "strong defense and effectively deterrence "
indeed, but we should proceed the military build up continuously . Even if there exists no threat, efforts of defense build up should not be stopped . Not to say that the PRC never rules out their policy of "invading Taiwan by force". In order to broaden the international survival environment, ensure security and development of ROC, it is necessary to enhance her Armed Forces continuously .

ROC's defense budget in FY 1998 is NT $ 274,782,670,000. It 5.

has been practically declined due to the factor of inflation. If this happened continuously, the quality advantage of ROCAF

would be lost in the near future. It is the problem that should

PART ONE 
NATIONAL SECURITY ENVIRONMENT
AND
MILITARY SITUATION 
1.

Although more and more states in the world recognize that the "economical effects" upon the international situation, and tend to solve the international issues by peaceful means so as to stabilize the international situation and develop their national economy. It still exists the potential armed conflicts in regions so that they have to continuously increase their military strength.

2.

In recent two years, most of the armed conflicts in the world are domestic racial antagonism, such as the civil wars happened in Albania, Afghanistan, and Zaire and other hostility between two African tribes. The potential factors for the possible armed struggle between nations are still in existence. The Korean Peninsula, the Taiwan Straits, the South China Sea, the South Asia, and the Middle East area is most probable to break out armed conflicts.

In order to cope with the new challenges in the post-Cold War world, the governments of the US and Japan have revised the "US-Japan Security Guideline" on September 23, 1997. They both agreed to reinforce the exchange of information, intelligence, and the consultation of policies.

In addition, also they will do their best with issues, including diplomatic methods, to prevent the peripheral areas of Japan from troubles and disturbances. An effective coordination will be made toward the actions they would

## I

3.

take so as to achieve a mutual-agreed assessment .

It is also recognized that the PRC's strength will be equal to that of Japan, EU, and Russia to dominate the new world order in the future. As such, Beijing is fully devoted itself to enhance its military strength, and positively engaged in promoting the multi-polarized international political affairs.

According to the PRC's "Defense Law", her military power is composed of the People's Liberation Army (PLA), the People's Police, and the People's Militia. The PLA currentty amounts to 2,700,000 (Army 1,870,000, Navy 360,000, Air Force 350,000, and Second Artillery 120,000),
and the People's Police, and the People's Militia odds 1,000,000 and 1,100,000 respectively. After the PRC signed
"Boarder Troops Reduction Agreement" with Russia, they have shifted their key deployment toward the southeastern boarder .

In 1997, the PLA's hidden fund amounts to 160 billion 5. 6.

RMBs, and the actual defense budget is 240 billion RMBs, three times the amount of the PRC's published funds.

7.

It is formally prescribed in PRC's "Defense Law", that the military action may be taken for the sake of the sovereignty, unification of China, integration of territory, and security. The PRC may take advantage of the Law as a basis to settle the Taiwan problem in the future by use of forces, and make an announcement to the world that it has the determination to safeguard the integration of territory.

# International Security Situation

## I . An Overall Situation

In an overall competition, the international situation displays a multiple-polarized development under the leadership of the United States as a superpower, other powers includes: European Union (EU), Japan, Russia, and Mainland China, but the impact of regional blocs upon international affairs is getting stronger everyday. Many states in the world recognize the "economic effects" upon the international situation, and tend to solve the international issues by peaceful means so as to stabilize the international situation and develop their national economy.

However there still exists potential armed conflicts in regions so that they must build up their military strength .

It is indicated in the "1997 U.S. Quadrennial Defense Review, QDR" that there still exists the risks and high uncertainty in the world. In the next 10 to 15 years, the U.S. will confront a series of regional risks. Therefore, the U.S. should create an international security environment to promote the US interests, be authorized to cope with the possible crises, and be prepared to deal with the uncertain challenges in the future. In view of this, the U.S. should maintain a force sufficient to simultaneously cope with the

conflicts in two major regions.

Asian Pacific area has significant strategic and economic interests to the U.S.; therefore, the US will still play a "military balance" role in the region. In the foreseeable future, the United States will keep a 100,000 forward deploying force. However, in order to alleviate the public opposition in the area and save the military funds for the forces stationed abroad, the government of the United States will close some overseas military bases so as to procure high-technological weaponry and equipment with the money saved.

Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States
(CIS) are undertaking their military reforms to include the force reduction, the strengthening of the military research and development, the development of the technology withmilitary and commercial application, and the integration of their military systems for a combined defense alliance.

These moves are to restore their military clout of the former Soviet Union, intervene step by step in the Asian Pacific affairs by increasing the military sales to Mainland China and improving the Russia-Japan relations, and expand their sphere of influence.

A "Founding Act on Mutual Corporation" governing the political and military relations was signed on May 27, 1997 between NATO and Russia. On September 26 of the same year, a "Joint Standing Council" was set up with a view to eliminate the obstacles for Czech, Poland and Hungary to join NATO(see Chart 1-1). However, this Act is only a political paper which is not necessary to be passed by the Congress. This will possibly affect its relationship to 

## 4 Nato Sometime In The Future.

Although western European countries generally agree that NATO is still the major security organization in the post-Cold War era, yet it is gradually evident that there is such a mental phenomena as some nations do not hope the U.S. dominates the European affairs. In view of this, they are actively strengthening the Eurocorps (note 1) and the West Europe Union (WEU, note 2) to be able to handle regional crises and weaken the impact of the U.S. upon the European affairs.

![30_image_0.png](30_image_0.png)

Chart 1-1 NATO's eastward expansion
...

The states in the Latin America are making every effort for political democralization and the establishment of the regional economic organizations to boost their national economies, including "the Organization of American States," "the Southern Common Market," (note 3) and
"the Group-77 Conference" (note 4)
The purpose of these economic organizations is to promote the economic cooperation, but they contribute the regional peace as well.

"The Organization of African Unity " is a major arbitrator for the peace in African area. But some countries suffer from political instability and economic difficulty which affect greatly the regional peace and stability, such as the military coup in the Republic of Burundi in July 1996, the civil war of Liberia, and the reestablishment of the Republic of Zaire in 1997.

Since its establishment of the new government, South Africa has been actively taking part in the international affairs and broadening its activities in the world. Its administrative development, and the increase of crime and unemployment rates have prevented the government from achieving its expected effectiveness. In January 1998, South Africa set up a normal diplomatic tie with PRC and ended the diplomatic relation with ROC.

NOTES :
1.   EUROCORPS: It was activated in December 1995 at Laon, France, with a view to maintaining the security of the 6 European Continent. The member states are Germany.

France, Spain, Belgium and Luxembourg.

WESTERN EUROPEAN UNION ( WEU ):  Established  on 2.

March 17, 1948, it is designed to prevent Germany from reviving its aggressive ambition and to fight against the Soviet Union's invasion with the members including Germany. Britain. France, the Neatherland, Belgium, Luxembourg, Spain, Portugal, Italy, and Greece.

3.

THE SOUTHERN COMMON MARKET : Founded on June 1, 1995 with its headquarters in Montevideo, Uruguay, the Southern Common Market is designed to unite the economic strength and resources of the South American states so as to promote the international competition power with its members including Brazil, Uruguay, Paraguay, and Argentina .

The Group-77 Conference: In 1964, the Group-77 States 4.

Conference was held in Geneva, sponsored by the United Nations. The 77 states signed a communiqué right after the conference for the purpose of safeguarding the economic interests for the developing countries. Now, this organization is composed of 132 members.

## Ii . Major Potential Conflict Areas

Most of the world's armed conflicts that happened in the past two years belong to a racial antagonism within a state, such as the civil wars in Albania, Afghanistan, Zaire, or hostility between two African tribes. Potentials for possible armed confrontations between nations have not abated. The Korean Peninsula, the Taiwan Straits, the

South China sea, the South Asia, and the Middle East contain the highest potential for armed conflicts.

1.

## The Korean Peninsula

On December 9, 1997, South Korea, North Korea, PRC, and the United States met for a four-side meeting in Geneva. Four countries agree to meet again on March 16, 1998 for a second conference. These conferences should bring positive influence on the stabalization of the peninsula .

## 2. The Taiwan Straits

The tension between the R.O.C. and mainland China Taiwan Straits seems to have softened, but the two still have a different interpretation of "One China." Mainland China insists "The policy of one China with two systems".

And by taking Hong Kong as an example for the execution of this policy, the PRC is tremendously making its propaganda in the world. Mainland China will not renounce the use of force against Taiwan but maintain "sabrerattling" against ROC on Taiwan. Therefore, there was no progress from the situation that the nation is currently divided and under separate jurisdictions to unification, the cross-strait relation fail to advance. There exists a lot of variables.

## 3. South China Sea Area

The PRC, Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, and Brunei have claimed that they all have the sovereignty over the territory of some islands and reefs in South China Sea

Area and have been strengthening their forces occupying the related islands. Nevertheless, Japan and the United States are fully involved in the area for the sake of the maritime transportation. Many states in Asian Pacific Area are greatly concerned over the issues by extending the U.S .- Japan Security Treaty to the South China Sea Area.

Therefore, Mainland China argued to temporarily put aside the sovereighty of the disputed territories and proposed to join develop the area to distract nations in the world from paying attention to its military buildup. No largescale conflict is expected to break out in the near future.

## South Asia Area 4 .

The claims of the sovereignty over the territory of
"Kashmir" between India and Pakistan poses the biggest obstacle to the peace and stability in South Asian Area. In spite of the high-level contact and dialogue, the two nations have been in hostility for quite a long time and the basis of their mutual trust is very weak. In particular, Pakistan has allied with the PRC and purchased some M-11 strategic missile from Beijing so as to threaten India, which worsen the relationship of the two states.

## 5. The Middle East Area

Iraq is still the greatest threat to the security of the Middle East Area. Conflicts are probable to break out between Iran and the U.S. Israel and Palestine have signed the two-phased Autonomy Agreement and put it into force.

Notwithstanding, the Israeli government has undergone several reshuffles and Iran is in support of the Palestinian

radical groups to fight against Israel. Subsequent peace talks contain unpredictable outcome.

## Ii . The Impact Of International Security Situation Upon The Roc On Taiwan

The democracy and free trade have been and will be the main stream in international development. Nonetheless, the potential elements to trigger the regional armed clashes may still be the tribal hostility, the friction of economy and trade, the issue of territorial claims, and the regional arms race. The United States will still play a role of "military balance" in the world, increase its contacts with the powers in various regions and the chances of bilateral and multilateral dialogues for security, and continuously promote political democracy, the free trade, drugcontrol, counterterrorism and anti-nuclear proliferation. This situation is favorable for the ROC to develop its political and econommic, but it is also favorable to Mainland China to reduce our international survival spaces by siding nations in the world earnestly hope to have peace and stability.

# Military Situation In Asian-Pacific Area

## I . An Overall Situation

Asian Pacific Region is wide in area in which countries vary by strategic environment, religion, culture, economy and technology so that the development of the regional situation moves toward many directions. However, the economic downfall recently causes the currency decrease.

Many military purchasing projects are forced to pospond.

The purpose of the U.S. policy toward Asian Pacific Area is to keep the region in stability so as to maintain its national interests. Thus, the U.S. will " intensify the relationship with Japan, ROK, and Australia and redefine and enlarge the U.S .- Japan Security Treaty"; "keep the U.S. troop stationed in the Asian Pacific Area and to reaffirm its security commitment; encourage participating in the regional organizations and promote the dialogues on regional security"; and "maintain contacts with the PRC
and engage it in the international system with a view to containing its behavior".

U.S .- Japan relation is the main axis of The Washington's Asia policies. In order to cope with the new challenges in the post-Cold War World, the governements of the U.S. and Japan revised the "U.S .- Japan Security

Guideline" on September 23, 1997. They agreed to enhance the exchange of information and intelligence and the consultation of policies. In addition, they will take any possible action, including diplomatic methods, to prevent disturbance from happening in the peripheral areas of Japan. And an effective coordination will be made toward the actions they will take so as to achieve a mutual-agreed assessment. However, Beijing considers that broadening of the scope of the U.S .- Japan Security Treaty is assigned to
"contain" the Mainland China, and Seoul is not willing to let the Japanese enter into its sea and air territory, so that it stands against the Treaty.

The prospect of "the 4-State Conference" in the Korean Peninsula is difficult to predict; the relationship between the two sides across the Taiwan Straits has not yet been improved; the sovereignty dispute of territories in South China Sea still remain; and there is no indication to settle the border disputes between India and Pakistan. Besides, Japan and the PRC continue their military buildup and the uncertainties will become higher. The countries in the region are now making every effort to alleviate possible armed conflicts and hostilities through the regional organizations such as ARF and APEC.

The PRC's impact upon the nations in Asian Pacific region has been increased since Hong Kong's return to China. However, the whole world pays closely attention to the fact whether or not Mainland China will fulfill its commitments to Hong Kong's existing economic and social systems unchanged in the next 50 years, and whether or not the people on Mainland China will ask for more autonomy

comparable to Hong Kong.

## Ii . Military Trends Of Countries In The Region 1. Japan

In 1997, the defense budget amounted to US $ 42.5 billion, up totaled 1.2% from 1996. The military forces totaled 240,000 persons (Army: 150,000, Navy: 40,000, Air Force:40,000. ) Its main weaponry and equipment are as follows: MBT: 1,160; submarines: 17; combat ships: 64; fighting crafts: 45; combat aircraft: 550; and armed helicopters: 200. In addition, there are 45,000 U.S. troops stationed in Japan .

Japan has gradually rebounded from a low point in 1994. Its 1996 economic growth rate ranked first among the G-7 industrial powers - the United States, Britain, Germany, France, Italy, Japan, and Canada. In recent years, Japan expanded its military strength due to Washington's policy of defense burden-sharing in Asian Pacific Region, and the growing militarists', the right wing', influence at home. In addition, Japan, is striving to be a permanent member of the UN Security Council, in order to transform into a political and military power .

The 1996 Defense Report of Japan indicated that the biggest threats to Japan's defense and security come from the PRC and North Korea. Hence, Japan's major defense areas and strategic force disposition have been transferred from the north into the southwest. Japan is now undertaking an intermediate-phased combat readiness (from

1996-2000) in accordance with the guideline of "the 1995 New Defense Outline, " with the key points in the following :
To replace the main weapons and equipment system so a.

as to uphold a military balance.

To thoroughly pursue an effective and rational military b.

oragnization.

To maintain and increase the reliability of the U.S.-
с.

:
Japan security system.

In the future, the U.S.-Japan relation will be further strengthened. And under U.S. support, Japan's clout in the Northeast Asia will be on the rise.

## 2. The Korean Peninsula

、a.

North Korea, DPRK:  IN  1997, the   defense   budget approximately amounted to US $ 5.3 billion, up 2.6%
from 1996. The total Armed Forces reached 1.12 million persons (Army: 1 million; Navy: 40,000; Air Force: more than 80,000.) The key weapons and equipment are as follows: MBT: 3,700; light tank:
about 500; submarines: 25; combat ships: 3; fighting crafts: about 400; combat aircraft: 770; and armed helicopters: 50.

The USA and North Korea entered into a cease fire agreement is 1953, which did not bring about a permanent peace in the peninsula. Pyongyang has been continuously expanding its military strength by infiltrating and threatening ROK. Furthermore, North Korea is consistently devoted to the R&D and deployment of its strategic missiles with the fire range

covering most portions of Japanese territory, posing serious threat to the security of the Northeast Asia.

On October 8, 1997, Kim Jeng II assumed the commander-in-chief of PLA. Right after taking over the Chairmanship of the Defense Commission, Kim was elected the Secretary General of the Korean Workers' Party, to be the leader of North Korea.

Although in the recent years, North Korea has an suffered economic distress and a serious famine, yet it still insisted the R&D of the nuclear weapons and the military buildup and the policy for a unification of Korea. Though it took action in the preliminary meeting of " the 4-States Conference", there was no indication that in the foreseeable future, Pyongyang will change its provocative stance toward South Korea .

ROK: In 1997, the defense budget totaled US $ 17 billion which is 1.7% higher than in 1996. The total military strength amounts to 630,000 persons, (Army:
520,000; Navy: 60,000; Air Force: 50,000. ) Primary weapons and equipment include: MBT: 2,000; submarines: 4; combat ships: 40; fighting crafts: 122; combat aircraft: 447, and armed helicopters: 140. In addition, the 37,000 U.S. soldiers have been deployed in South Korea to support the defense in the area.

According to the " 1997 Third Defense Improvement Plan, " ROK, during 1998-2000, will invest more than US $ 126 billion to purchase advanced weapons and equipment. But in order to avoid causing an arms race at sea with Mainland China, Japan, and peripheral states of the Korean Peninsula, the ROK has b.

decided to delay the construction of 700-800 ton KDX II
destroyer and the harpoon-equipped heavy submarine under the Oceanic Navy Plan. Lately, the currency decrease in east Asia countries causes the pospond or cancel of many military purchasing proposals.

## 3. Southeast Asian Countries

In recent years, the defense budget of countries in this region increase as the result of economic growth (Table 1-1). However, the economic downfall of 1997 caused currency decrease. Countries in this region, except Singapore, were forced to slow down the process of defense modernization. Also influenced by the PRC's military buildup and the disputed sovereignty of territory over the islands and reefs at South China Sea, the Southeast Asian nations, for the sake of their national interests and security, have invested handsomely to expand their military strength
(See Charts 1-1 and 1-2), They also strengthened regional military cooperation, such as "the Five Power Defense Agreement, FPDA " signed by Singapore, Malaysia, Australia, New Zealand, and Britain. Indonesia and Philippines respectively entered into military cooperation with Australia to counter PRC's military expansion. It is in a hope that the collective power can deter the PRC on the one hand, and on the other, they are having dialogues with Mainland China through ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF)
for the purpose of reducing hostility and potential conflicts, and supporting the United States to continuously play a role of "military balance" so as to preserve the peace and stability in Southeast Asia .

## 16 Ii . The Impact Of The Asian-Pacific Area Military Situation Upon The Roc On Taiwan

As a whole there are many potential elements influencing the peace and stability of Asian Pacific Area and it lacks regional security organizations. But, under a consensus of "peaceful co-existence and cooperative coprosperity," and in viewing broadening of a scope of the U.S .- Japan Security Treaty, no potential armed conflicts are likely to break out in the near future. However, the PRC still seems to be a major threat to the Asian Pacific security. States in the region, with a view to maintaining their national security and gaining their regional clout, have to side with Beijing, which affected moves to join regional organizations and our rights to be engaged in the economic and trade activities in the region.

# Mainland China'S (Prc) Military Situation

## I . Strategic Environment

Mainland China considers that the collapse of the Soviet Union and a gradual deterioration of the United States powers give the "middle-size states" or regional powers chances to expand their influence in international politics. To Beijing, the PRC's position will be equal to that of Japan, EU, and Russia to dominate the operations in the new world order. Beijing has been fully devoted to enhancing its military strength and engaged in pomoting the multi-polarized international political affairs. In 1997, Mainland China, in turn, signed "the Strategic Partnership Agreements " or created similar relations with Russia, ASEAN, India, France, and the United States.(note 5) Beijing desired that its activities would boost the PRC's international position to sway the behaviors of its neighboring states and to create an environment favorable to Mainland China's development.

## 1. The United States

Beijing believed that Washington forged "the Theory of PRC's Threat". PRC considered that Washington's China policy is to engage the PRC in promoting the global

strategic interests on the one hand, contain the Mainland China on the other hand so as to bow to U.S. criterion and value. In consideration of an overall strategy and the economic development, Beijing is earnstly to promote the relationship with Washington. Thus, the PRC recognizes:
The PRC-US bilateral relalionship should be a.

centered upon the strategic and global context with a view forward the 21st century. The bilateral relation, should be based upon the b.

"Three Communiques" and only adherence to these three communiqué can they set up a stable relationship.

Each should respect the other, treat the other in c.

equal position and seek agreements on things in _
common.

They should be carefully to deal with the Taiwan d.

issue.

The United States thinks that it is necessary to have an engagement policy with Mainland China in order to stabilize the Asian Pacific Region and international situation.

Frequent exchange of visits of high-level officials sigified that, the U.S .- PRC relation has been significantly improved.

## 2. Russia

Right now, the PRC is taking advantage of Russia's political and economic hardship to strengthen their cooperative relations in the field of economy, trade, and military, hoping to obtain some advanced weapons and defense technology from Moscow. A model for the

exchange of visits conducted by high-ranking officials of the two countries has been formed, and the signed agreements, the designed balance power from Japan and the United States in the region include: "Mutual Trust Agreement on the Military Zone Along the Sino-Russian Border, "Force Reduction Agreement of Sino-Russian Border, " and
"Strategic Partnership Agreement."

## 3. Japan

The guideline for the PRC's policy toward Japan is something like this: " Cooperation benefits both, and struggle certainly backfires." As their relations get closer, friction and disputes accumulate. They have entered into such a phase as friendship, friction, coordination, and contradiction are all simultaneously in existence. In the future, although Tokoyo will keep providing assistance to Beijing without asking compensation, it won't slacken vigilance to the PRC.

## 4 . The Korean Peninsula

Mainland China's policy toward the Korean Peninsula is a pragmatic. It means that China maintains good economic and trade ties with ROK, while keeping traditional friendship with North Korea in the field of ideology and politics so as to preserve its influence in the Peninsula.

## ર્ . Southeast Asian Countries

The PRC considers that the "U.S.-Japan Defense Cooperation" and the U.S.-Australia alliance are designed to make a strategic containment against Mainland China

from the north and the south. In view of this, the PRC is enhancing diplomatic ties with ASEAN, Burma, Cambodia, and Laos, and reestablishing diplomatic relation with Vietnam. Furthermore, Beijing is now making efforts to hinder the ROC's southward policy and the implementation of the Asian Pacific Regional Operations Center by developing Southwest China to balance the economic gap between the mainland's coastal area and the inland to draw closer relation with Southeast Asian countries.

## 6. South Asian Countries

China and India had engaged in two largescale wars along the China-Burma-India borders in 1962. Rounds of talks and negotiations between these two states, several agreements were signed, including one that both sides agreed to pull out some troops deployed in the area and construct " the Constructive Partnership. "
The PRC is said to have adopted a balanced policy toward the sub-continent. Mainland China still supports Pakistan's claim over sovereignty of Kashmir while improving the links with India in order to get better relations with Burma, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka by supplying types of weapons.

## 7. Taiwan Waters

Mainland China claims that: "One China means that it includes Chinese mainland, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao, and the PRC is the government representing China.

" To Beijing, the Taiwan autborities have departed from the principle of one China, trying to creat two Chinas, one

China, one Taiwan in the world by constitutional reforms, pragmatic diplomacy, and other secessionist moves." The PRC has repeatedly stressed: " The PRC vowed its determination to preserve every inch of land even at the sacrifice of thousands of soldiers. It does not rule out the use of forces to resolve the Taiwan issue provided that once Taiwan independence or comes under foreign control."

## Note:

5:  The Strategic Partnership is a post-Cold War term which generally refers to the close relationship between two nations, while its substance depends on the contents of the agreement. For example, the Russia-PRC "Strategic Coordination and Cooperation Partnership " designed to promote a multi-polarized world, oppose any domination over the international affairs, and establish a fair and reasonable new order of the international economy. The U.S.-PRC "Constructive Strategic Partnership" establishes a broader framework under which they can develop a cooperation relationship on human rights, non-nuclear proliferation, and trade. "The Strategic Partnership" may possibly include military relations, but it is not equal to the military alliance. In order to execute and put the agreement into force, both parties must stress the overall situation so as to continuously expand the cooperative relations by putting aside conflicts of less importance.

## Ii . Military Strength 1998 National Defense Report

According to the PRC's "Defense Law, " the Armed Forces are composed of the People's Liberation Army (PLA), the People's Police, and the People's Militia. The PLA, organized into the active troops and the reserves, is a regular force, responsible for the major operational missions, and at the same time, it renders assistance in maintaining the social order when necessary. In peaceful time, the reserves are required to receive their training accordingly. While at wartime, they are asked to serve the active services in accordance with the Mobilization Order issued.

The forces are deployed into seven great military regions, and Army, Navy, Air Force, the Second Artillery (See Chart 1-2 for situation map of PLA's force disposition )
combined in deployment.

(1) Army: The key points of the PLA's force disposition have been re-diverted to the southeast area of Chinese mainland since the

signature of the "PRC-Russia Bilateral Force Reduction Agreement."
The Southeast Area ( Nanjing Military Region and Guangzhou Military Region):
5 army groups are deployed, numbering about 480,000 in total.

(a) 
(b)
The Northeast Area (Shenyang Military Region ):  The   total approximately 310,000 persons, organized into 5 army groups.

(c)
The Southwest Area ( Chengdu Military Region): The total manpower amounts to 180,000 persons, composed of 2 army groups .

(d)
The Northwest Area (Lanzhou Military Region): Two army groups are deployed in the area, a force numbering more than 220,000 in total.

The Capital Area ( Beijing Military Region): The total strength amounts to about 410,000 persons, organized into 6 army groups.

(e)
(f)
The Strategic Reserve ( Jinan Military Region ): The total manpower is some 240,000 persons, consisting of 4 army groups .

(2) 
Navy: The PRC believes that the greatest potential for sea conflicts might erupt at the East China Sea and the South China Sea.

Thus, the "Emergency Mobile Force " is

assigned to the East Sea Fleet and the South Sea Fleet. Although the North Sea Fleet has a better equipment, yet generally speaking, the total combat capabilities of the East Sea Fleet and the South Sea Fleet are superior to others.

(a)
The North Sea Fleet (deployed in an area Yalu Jiang, Liaoning, to Lianyungang, Jiangsu): This fleet possesses the major bases in Lushun and Qingdao. It has about 950 plus ships.

The East Sea Fleet (deployed in an area
(b)
from Lianyungang, Jiangsu, to Zhaoan, Fujian): This fleet has the major bases in Shanghai, Zhoushan, and Fuzhou, deployed in the area with 980 plus ships.

The South Sea Fleet (deployed in an area
(c)
from Zhaoan, Fujian, to Beilunhekou; Guangxi, and the parcel and sparely waters ): It has the major bases in Guangzhou, Zhanjiang, Yulin with 800 odd ships.

Air Force: The concept of the deployment is
(3)
to set up one air command at each military region. At present, stationed on the air bases within 500 nautical miles from Taiwan are 1,300 aircrafts, of which some 600 airplanes has a radius of operation over Taiwan proper.

In addition, the SU-27 with a radius of operation of about 810 nautical miles, now based at Wu Hu, Anhui Province, and Juixi,

Guangdong Province, also covers Taiwan (See Chart 1-3).

(4) · The Second Artillery: The strategic (tactical)
disposition of the PRC's missile forces still mainly aims at Russia and the United States with only a portion targetting the neighboring states potential threat. The disposition of missiles is deployed in a small number and scattered throughout the Chinese mainland so as to increase the survival opportunity at a nuclear war. At present, the PRC has completed its disposition of DF-3 (Dongfeng3), DF-4, DF-5, DF-15, and DF-21, etc., of which the DF-15 (M-9) tactical mobile missile is deployed in the area of Leping, Jiangxe, while its forward positions are scattered along the Jiangxi-Fujian area with ranges covering whole Taiwan (See Chart 1-4).

C.

Right after taking over Hong Kong, the PRC
directed the Guangzhou Military Region to organize forces to station in Hong Kong. It's total strength approximately amounts to 6,000 persons with the following equipment: armored vehicles:
21, helicopters: 9, and combat crafts: 12. In addition, the PLA has selected stonecutters island in Hong Kong as a gate for the construction of a large deep-water harbor to anchor the ships based in Hong Kong. Besides, it may be used as a forward base of the South Sea Fleet as well as a relay harbor in support of the operations at the South China Sea, which poses a threaten to the security of our islands.

## The People'S Armed Police

The People's Armed Police, one of the PRC's three Armed Forces, numbering 1.1 million plus, has military and security missions. The Armed Police is divided into the following in accordance with the nature of missions and T/
O: security guards, defense for borders, fire teams, traffic, public utility, gold, woods and mobile division. In a peaceful time, it is responsible for the interior security in coordination with the public security units, the nationallevel construction works, and guards. At wartime, it is under military command to carry out missions such as battlefield security, anti-infiltration, and coast guards.

Since "the Democratic Movement June, 4 1989 in Tianmen Square," the status and importance of the People's Armed Police have seen rapidly elevated. The CCP's

Central Military Committee has made public that in case there is any domestic upheaval, the People's Armed Police will be first mobilized. In other words, the Armed Police is PRC's main force in charge of the domestic security and social stability .

a.

Command System: There are two chains of Command for People's Armed Police. The Armed Police is simultaneously under the command of the CCP's Central Military Committee and the State Council. Since the issuance of "the SOP of the PRC's Armed Police GHOs" in June 1996, the People's Armed Police GHOs has been upgraded to a great military-region level. And over the last two years, it was time and again found that 14 PLA
field divisions were restructured into the People's Armed Police. Furthermore, there is a tendency that the command system of the People's Armed Police is going to be transferred from under the Ministry of Interior to the military system, and its military function is beefed up.

The Future Development: The PRC's Armed b.

Police with a mixed function between the military police and the police of the democratic countries is equipped with the light weapons. In recent years, its forces have been beefed up with the wheel armored vehicles, command vehicles, and patrol cars, etc. Besides, the air patrol units like the fly boat and helicopter units have been activated with the capabilities in the field of the mobile and longrange disposition. Its contingencies have

capabilities better than those of the public security police in general. Some of the GHO-level units of the Armed Police are given the PLA's military training and exercise, functioning as the main force of the domestic public security.

## 3. The People'S Militia And The Reserve

The people's militia and reserve are the main reserve strength of the PLA's mobilization. The reserve is mainly composed of the retired and separated officers and soldiers, numbering more than 1 million persons in total. The people's militia consists of the members of enterprise and production units and organizations at districts, villages, and towns, through a "two-in-one ( labor and military )"
alignment. The troop trainings may either be conducted by themselves, or in lieu of the PLA. The training duration is shorter and the performance for training is lower.

However, the people's willingness to join in the militia organizations is dropping due to changing economic development, social atmosphere, and the value system. Of course, their function is also shrinking. However, the reserve is under expansion by means of the surplus manpower separated from the PLA's force and by 2,000, one reserve division will be activated in each of the 316 Corps Districts.

## Iii . Defense  Mobilization

According to the 1984 PRC's Military Service Law,
"The PRC defense mobilization adheres to the principle: "

"Uniting the military and civilians, treating the peace time as war times, and training soldiers out of civilians. " In peace time, the retired servicemen and civilians at draft ages (at the ages from 18 to 35), pending their regular military services are drafted into a militia and reservist, primarily engaged in economic production. At wartime; they have to receive the combat readiness and mobilization training to be assigned to the armed, economic, air defense, technological, political, and traffic activities so as to meet the requirements of a high-technological warfare.

In order to integrate the chain of command and strengthen the management of mobilization, the CCP's Central Committee in 1994, established a defense mobilization committee with members from People's Armed Mobilization Committee and those technological, postal, sanitary, statistical, rail, and navigational personnel of
"the People's Armed Committee, " "the Combat Readiness Directory Team," and "the Radio Management Committee" to exclusively in charge with the defense mobilization operation, direct and investigate the defense potentiality for the provinces and districts, collect information of the scattered manpower and material, and establish the storage depots for the strategic supplies as well as the mobilization units of the autonomous government. In March 1996, the CCP's Central Committee reassigned "the People's Armed Department" to be under the command of the General Staff Department and commissioned the chiefs and commanders military ranks to strengthen the local mobilization and management and training for the militias and reservists.

## 36 Iv . Defense Budget

The PRC's defense budget amounted to 80.57 billion RMBs in 1997, up 12.68% from the previous year, doubling from the figure five years ago. (See Table 1-3)
The Mainland China's published defense budget only represented at the portion of its defense outlay, not including the following items: the expenditure of the defense technological, R&D, the expenditure of the militia establishment, the spending of the special projects and other outlays. Besides, there are a great deal of overheads hidden in items for the pension and social welfare relief, the people's armed police, the education, culture, science and hygiene units. Funds earned from the commercial businesses run by the military are also hidden. According to 1997 statistics, the PLA's hidden funds exceeded 160 billion RMBs and the actual defense budget was 240 billion RMBs, three times PRC's announced amount.

The General Situation of PLA's Training and Table 1-5 Exereise in Recent Three Years
2. "Specific Exercise" means the ones which the PLA officials claimed as responses to the pragmatic foreign policy of R.O.C.

In July 1995 and March 1996, the PLA, with a theater for Nanjing Military Region, conducted 7 actual maneuvers as if invading Taiwan. In recent two years, its naval and Air Forces in bases like Nanking, Guangzhou, Jinan have carried out several times of the simulated maneuvers with the new generation of ROC's force as its hypothetical enemy. It is estimated that except expanding its scope of activities so as to show its military blockade capability of the Taiwan Strait, rattling its sabre toward the ROC and announcing its sovereignty over Taiwan to the world, the PLA also took advantage of this good opportunity to test the water for branch coordination operations, have a drill for command procedures, and to understand the operational plan against Taiwan in the future local war 1998 National Defense Report under high-technological condition.

## Vi . Military Diplomacy

The PRC recognizes that the military exchange activities should serve the interest of national diplomacy and the military modernization. In recent years, Mainland China has escalated its military diplomacy. After the crisis of the Taiwan Strait, both the quality and quantity of Beijing's military diplomacy have been significantly increased. In 1996 and 1997, the PLA received more than 220 military missions from more than 100 countries.

Additionally, it has sent numerous military delegations of the CCP's Central Military Committee, the General Staff Department, the General Political Department and the General Logistics Department, led by high-ranking generals and admirals of various services, to visit 70 states for promoting military exchanges, explaining defense policy, and purchasing military items. In 1997, the PLA's naval fleet reciprocated goodwill port calls on the Southeast Asia, the United States, and the Latin American countries.

In order to elaborate on its "one China" policy and 1.

rebut the theory of PRC's threat, Beijing has reiterated the followings during its military exchanges: The PRC's defense policy is defensive in nature and designed to protect its territory, territorial space, and territorial waters from invasion for the purpose of maintaining a "unified China."
There is only one China in the world, and Taiwan is an inseparable part of China. If foreign powers are involved in 2.

3.

"the unification of China" or "Taiwan independence," the PRC will take all means including the use of forces to defend the integrity of national territory and the sovereignty .

"The Theory of PRC's Threat" is groundless and fabricated to sabotage Mainland China's relations with its neighboring states.

The PRC fully understands that it is important and necessary for Beijing to strengthen its military exchanges with Washington. As such, in the recent two years, PRC
President Jiang Zemin, Chairman of the CCP's Central Military Committee, Defense Minister Chi Haotian; General Chief of Staff Fu Quan; Deputy General Chief of Staff Wei Fuling; Deputy General Chief of Staff Xiung Guang-kai, President of the National Defense University Xing Shizhong, C-in-C of the Air Force Yu Zhenwu paid in turn courtesy calls on the United States. In addition, the following agreements have been reached during Jiang Zemin's visit to Washington in October 1997:
To jointly establish "the Constructive Strategic a.

Partnership" between the PRC and the United States.

To arrange regular exchange of visits by the state b.

heads of the two nations and install a Washington-
Beijing hot line.

c.

To regularly hold conference to discuss politics, military, security, and arms reduction.

## Vii .

The Impact of Mainland China's Military Situation upon R.O.C. on Taiwan

In sum, the PLA's military development in recent two years can be summarized as defense budget increase and the military buildup. The PLA has accomplished partial force reduction and readjustment, the activation of the
" Emergency Mobile Force, " the combat readiness constructions along the southeast coastal area, the R&D and replacement of the weapons and equipment, and the establishment of the combat tactics against Taiwan and CªI.

In particular, the PLA's major military establisment has been shifted to the southeast coastal area since the signature of "the PRC-Russia Border Force Reduction Agreement."
Thus, PRC's threat to ROC's defense security has substantially increased to such an extent that the PLA is capable of launching its air and naval attacks against Taiwan, conducting local and overall blockade, and invading offshore islands. It is estimated that the forces available to the PLA for the invasion of Taiwan are as follows:
Ground Forces

## 1.

In addition to about 80,000 troops of the 31st Army Group deployed in Fujian region, the PLA could reshuffle in a short period some of the "Rapid Reaction Force" of other military regions, the troops with stronger combat capability, and 260,000 strategic reserves to the area.

Naval Forces They are able to set out submarines and motorized fishing vessels to make a long-standing sea blockade. They can lay mines over the peripheral waters of Taiwan proper and the offshore islands, concentrate the amphibious landing crafts transporting one reinforced division to 2.

conduct a regular landing operation, or make a good use of the motorized fishing vessels to render a sea blockade and carry by batches 350,000 light infantry to undertake an irregular landing operation .

## 3.

Air Force At the 13 military-civilian airports within 250 NM away from the Taiwan proper, the PRC's Air Force can station 1,200 combat aircrafts and maneuver 59 air transports to carry two airborne regiments for operational mission. The Second Artillery 4.

The DF-15 (M-9) and DF-21 may directly attack our key political, economical, and military targets. This is the most serious type of operations the PRC may choose to invade Taiwan by the use of force.

PRC has written into "the Defense Law," adopted at the 5th Session of the 8th Convention of the National People's Congress in March 1997, that the military action may be taken for the sake of the sovereignty, unification of China, integrity of territory, and security. The law serve as a legal basis to settle the Taiwan problem in the future by use of forces declaration that it has the determination to safeguard the integrity of territory. The people in all walks of life here in Taiwan should fully understand and be alert that only defense capability can maintain national secruity.

The ROC government's primary responsibilities are to
" provide for national security and living environment without terrorism, as well as to establish a foundation for permanent prosperity and progressive development. " Therefore, the administration should establish an effective defense policy to cope with the external threats while promote and encourage the national competitive power.

ROC's national defense objective is to protect the country's security and maintain the world peace. However, China is currently divided and under separated jurisdiction. Also the PRC times and again announces that it does not rule out the use of its forces to unify China. In order to achieve the objective of keeping Taiwan, Peughu, Kinmen and Matsu secure and protect people's livelihood, stabilize the situation in Taiwan Straits, broad international survival space, and accomplish the unification of China by means of peace and democracy, the ROC's primary defense mission is to prevent the PRC from invading Taiwan by force and win the military victory.

In accordance with the strategy concept of "strong defense posture and effective deterrence," the guidance of current defense operations is based on the principle, "not to provoke any war but not escape from the war" under any circumstances. Should the opposing force make a forced landing, the ROC Armed Forces are to fight it vehemently, in accordance with the guidance of strategic endurance and tactical quick decision, to win the final victory.

The total strength of R.O.C. Armed Forces amounts some 5.

The civil defense mobilization is a measure necessary to assure the national security by means of the nation's manpower, material, and finance as a whole. When it establishes its organizations, the government should simultaneously consider the problem of the people's livelihood, and put emphasis upon the peacetime preparation.

The civil defense is an organization and action by means of 7.

the people's strength as a whole, to develop the functions of self-defense and self-relief in civilian sector, so as to protect the safety of people's life and property collectively. As for the national civil defense as a whole, the Ministry of Interior ( MOI ) is responsible for the civil defense administrative works, while the MND is in charge of the control and employment.

# The Necessity Of National Defense

## I . The Government'S Responsibility

The government's primary responsibilities are to provide for national security and an living environment without terrorism, as well as to establish a foundation for permanent prosperity and progressive development. Therefore, the administration should establish an effective defense policy to cope with the external threats while it promotes and encourages national competitive power.

1. 2.

In the field of politics, the government should make every effort to upgrade democratic standards, encourage her citizens take pride in their country, promote capabilities to regional peace, and continue to improve defense capabilities to safeguard the nation.

For the economy, the ROC on Taiwan will promulgate national policy to practically take the policy of putting the national defense and the people's livelihood in one, develop national economy that will also support a strong national defense.

3.

For national morale, the administration intends to promote national loyalty, strengthen democratic institutions, improve morale, and encourage the people's support for defense.

4.

In the military realm, the MND of ROC is responsible for improving the defense military organization, the.

management, and the combat effectiveness of the Armed t Forces, in order to enhance defense operations, and maintain national security.

## Ii . The Contents Of The Defense Construction

Modern war is not simply the application of military force, but it incorporates politics, economics, culture and the military. Thus, the ROC must pay attention to total concept in our defense modernization. It takes a stable political organization in order to strengthen the people's loyalty for their mother country, the economic construction as its logistical support to increase its defense strength, the psychological construction as the dynamic to consolidate the will of the people in all walks of life, and the military construction as its nucleus to deter the enemy unable to render a threat by force.

Over the years, the PRC has not recognized the fact that the ROC on Taiwan is a political entity, the area of Taiwan, Penghu (the pascadores), Kinmen, and Matsu is under the ROC's territorial jurisdiction, and the Chinese people in all walks of life are willing to pursue freedom, democracy and equality of wealth. It insists the policy of one China with two systems for the unification, does not rule out the use of its forces to invade Taiwan, and frequeutly makes effort to isolate ROC diplomatic relation and narrows down our international survival space with the intent to deny the ROC's existence in the world.

## 5% Defense Policy     53

Furthermore, Beijing is alineating our people from their government by means of business for a long time.

Therefore, the people on Taiwan should unite and support the government to increase the national strength and create a solid foundation to accomplish the objectives national security , and sustained political and economic development .

# The Present Defense Policy

## I . Defense Objective

Our defense objective is to protect the country's security and maintain the world peace. But the nation is currently divided and under separated jurisdiction, and the PRC times and again announces that it does not rule out the use of its forces to unify China. In order to achieve the objective of keeping Taiwan, Peughu, Kinmen and Matsu in secure and protect people's livelihood, stabilize the situation in the Taiwan straits, broad our international survival space, and accomplish the unification of China with peaceful and democratic means, the ROC's primary defense mission is to prevent the PRC from invading Taiwan by force and achieve military victory. Additionally, it is clearly prescribed in the Article 137 of the ROC's Constitution that the "the ROC's national defense is designed to defend national security and maintain the world peace. " In order to fulfill its international obligations, promote the peaceful co-existerce, and strengthen the national security, the ROC may also use its military forces to maintain the world peace if necessary.

## Ii . Basic Concept 55

1.

The total defense: Everyone in Taiwan should rise up the sense of urgency and face up to the challenge, firm up their will to defend the country, support and participate in national construction, and increase defense strength to deter the enemy from threatening the R.O.C.

National defense consists of the military capability to cope with the external threats, promote social stability and public morality, and also to promote the nation's political, economical and cultural development. In order to secure the existing society and political system of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu and increase the benefits to our descendants in next generations, all people should regard the national security as their personal responsibility.

Whatever their political party, tribe, or occupation is, they should be steadfast in the recognition of our country and render assistance to the government so to prevent the PRC's use of force to threaten us and to fully support and participate in the national defense modernization.

An extension of ties with more friendly states: The ROC's 2. 

government makes every effort to extend its ties with more friendly states in the world for the propose of upgrading the peaceful co-existence and cooperative settlement, avoiding the crises, and reducing chance for out break of the war.

Although it is impractical for any nation to totally rely on the foreign powers to provide for its national defense mission, it is also not appropriate for us to expect to achieve total national security alone. In other words, it should be accomplished in cooperation with other friendly nations concerned. As such, while it increases its national defense

constructions, this country will integrate the overall strength. In principle, it is independent in nature in dealing with its functions, but sometimes, it is necessary to coordinate and cooperate with other states in the region in order to set up a multichannel dialogue, establish channels to prevent conflicts and war.

3.

An overall operation: Defense program and people's livelihood should be united so as to integrate the political, economical, psychological and military strength. This will fully complete operational preperation, and lay foundation for victory .

In view of the technological developments today, the early warning time of war, is shorter than ever. There is no difference between peace and war as well as the front and rear due to the extension of the theater. In order to effectively employ the national manpower, materials, and funds as a whole to successfully conduct an operation, the principle of uniting the national defense works and livelihood should be conducted in peace time. Only by putting an emphasis on the national defense security to strengthen the defense preparations in peace time, we can closely coordinate and integrate with the political, economical, psychological, and military forces to gain a victory in wartime.

## Iii . The Military Policy 1. An Independent And Self-Sufficient Defnese Policy

The current directives of the defense policy of the

Armed Forces are based on the establishment of strong defensive regular Forces and Reserve to independently cope with the external threats as a basis so as to maintain the national security with a coordinated self-sufficient defense industry capability.

## 2. A Strong Defense Posture And Effective Deterrence

The military buildup is based on the principles: "To stop the war but not to be afraid of war, and to prepare for the war but not to seek the war." If the PRC invaded Taiwan by forces, the Armed Forces of ROC will do their best to hold every pieces of the territory for an ultimate triumph.

## 3. A Perfect Mobilization And Keeping The Soldiers In Civilian Life In Time Of Peace.

With an immediate mobilization and operation as its objective, the MND has perfected the mobilization troops' structure and training, increased the mobilization equipment, and strengthened the reservist combat capability .

## 4. The Mutual Safety And Prevention Of War

Keeping the spirit of stopping the war by a peaceful means in mind, the government is prepared to extend its military diplomacy, open the communication channels, upgrade the mutual trust, set up a criteria of military actions, and prevent wars that caused by a misunderstanding or mis-estimation.

## Building Up Of Military Strength Iv . The Guidance Of Defense Operations V .

The buildup of the defensive capabilities is based on
" the concept of the force construction " and " the improvement of the forces" for having the kind of troops for performing the kind of missions, "or in other words, "
the right kind of weapons and equipment will be available to fight the right kind of war. "It is an ideal case for the sake of realizing it for practical purpose that the forcebuilding should be accomplished year by year and period by period.

The ROC cause the enemy think twice before initiating war.

Basing on the goal of "automation, integration, adding missile forces and coordinated joint operations, " the ROC is to build up "a small-sized but "elite," "rapid response" and
"top efficient" troops to simplify and sharpen the Armed Forces and its organizational structure.

1.

Military weapons may be either procured from foreign states, or developed indigenously and/or in cooperative manufacture agreements to improve and replace obsolete weapon systems in order to upgrade the defensive capability .

2.

In accordance with the strategic concept of a strong defense posture and effective deterrence ( note 6 ) , the guidance of current defense operations is based on the principle, "not to provoke any war but also not avoid war" under any possible circumstance. Our strategy is to prepare

for "an emergency contingency" and "a rapid response," and to hold a large reserve force to deter the enemy. Should the opposing force make a forced landing, the ROC Armed Forces are to fight it vehemently, in accordance with the guidance of strategic endurance and rapid response to make the enemy pay the prices as high as possible. Many strongholds will be firmly defended, while the follow-up mobile counter-offensive force may annihilate the enemies on the beach head line or in invasion positions. The enemy's attrition will be surely so high as to contribute to our final victory .

## Note:

6.

Effective deterrence is the kind of the defensive deterrence designed to anticipate with minimum strength regard to deter the enemy and let him understand that it will be to deal with a whistle by means of an attacking force.

However, it depends upon the opposing forces recognition (the enemy's reaction) of our strength, in order to rule out the use of force. Thus, the defender should keep increasing its defensive strength until the enemy gives up its plans to employ its forces.

# Military  Mobilization

## I . Force Mobilization 1. Reservists Status

As we know, the reservists play an important role in the country's overall combat effectiveness. Taking into account both the defense security and economic development, the government has set a policy "to reduce the number of regular forces and increase that of the reservists, " with the intent to achieve the objective of "retaining fewer soldiers in peace time and mobilizing more forces at wartime."
In 1997, the registered reservists of this country amount to more than 3,870,000 persons with 3,060,000 assigned to the Army, 450,000 assigned to the Navy, and 360,000 assigned to the Air Force, which is 18% of the total population. Within the Reserves there are over 310,000 officers, 1,371,000 NCOs, and 2,189,000 enlisted personnel. (Table 2-1)

## 2. Team Arrangement Of The Reservists

Reserve Team a.

All the registered reservists are organized into 77

"reserve teams" in relation to their residences such as "Tsun" and "Li" as the basis with Lin as a unit.

They are managed by the reservist service stations of each township throughout the household administration channel.

b.

They may apply for this purpose to the military training office of the high (polytechnic) schools at which they are studying. The applicants who are approved by the Service GHQs concerned are qualified to join the Army for a three-year service as reserve NCOs. From 1996 to 1998, 4,199 persons were selected for this purpose. They have so far made a good record in the military because they are able to effectively develop their civilian specialties.

An Activation for the Two-Year Technological Department In a contrast to the academic system for the b.

technological college, the MND has taken a policy that a recruitment is made to the youths graduating from junior colleges. After enrollment, the draftees may receive a two-year basic training as a professional line officer. Upon graduation, they are awarded a bachelor's degree and assigned as a second lieutanent, and required to serve in the military as a voluntary officer at least for 6 years. This program began in Army Academy in academic year of 1996 for trial purposes. There are now 59

c.

students in the business administration and electrical mechanic departments under training at the Army Academy .

The Establishment of ROTC at University In order to meet the Armed Forces cadres demand, since 1997 academic year, the MND has established the "ROTC at University" to attract the skilled youths to join the Army. Through selection examinations from the public and private colleges, the MND will provide a scholarship to outstanding sophomores who are willing to serve the country
(not including those who have already received public scholarship ) with a view to preparing themselves as for ROTC on a voluntary basis. The ROC Army has been conducting this program as a trial since the 1997 academic year. They are receiving ROTC at the Northern, Central and Southern Educational Centers 4 hours a week of the subjects including military theory. During the winter and summer vacations, they will be assigned to the Army Academy to receive basic military education. Upon graduation from the university, they will then take part in specities MOS training at the branch school concerned. After completing the training, the qualified graduates will be assigned as a Second Lieutenant to serve in the military at least for 5 years.

Expanding the Employment of WAC Officers and NCOs Since 1992, the ROCAF has activated the "WAC
d.

Officers and NCOs Training Course " for the purpose of recruiting female youths to join the Armed Forces, serving in noncombatant jobs. As of the end of 1997, 4,718 females have been drafted for this purpose and assigned to the activities, schools, hospitals, factories, plants, depots, and other units at the levels higher than battalion. (See Table 3-1 and Table 3-2) Generally speaking, these females have had a good record has been so far made in the field of their services to the Armed Forces. In addition, in order to broaden the channel for the WAC's career development, the ROC government has taken a policy since June 1995 that female youths are included in the cadets of the Military Academies in order to enlarge the service scope for the WAC and made a good use of the female manpower to upgrade the overall combat capability for the ROCAF in coordination with the " plan for the ROC Armed Forces Organization and Force Structure."

## Manpower Quality

As the growth rate of the nation's middle and high education, the ROCAF is also currently elevating its officers' and men educational levels. Officers and soldiers with their educational level higher than high school totaled 84.07% in 1997, as compared to 82.82% of 1995. For the comparision of educational level of the officers and men in the most recent three years, see Chart 3-2.

The MND has been taking such measures as the "enrolling, training, employing, retiring, and veteran-caring," etc. , based on the military concept and the requirements of the strength buildup, so that the ROCAF's cadres will be fully willing to serve the Armed Forces, working at a right place as an active duty, and may quickly join in the national constructions immediately upon retirement.

## I . Defense  Industry 1. Policy

a.

In adherence to the principle that the mobilization is based on the administrative works, while the combat readiness on the economic constructions, the MND is in cooperation with the public and private enterprises so as to have the defense industry based on the civilian sector.

b.

The capabilities for the production, manufacture, and R&D of the military supplies are upgraded by uniting together the manufacturing, official, and academic circles so as do help the private industry and support the economy and diplomacy.

It is to gain the industrial cooperation and elevate the national industry level as a whole.

c. 

## 2. Execution

a.

Research and Manufacture of the Military Hardware: A joint evaluation of the defense industry is launched every year to assess the current 118

output capability and technology of public and private factories. It aims at assisting them in solving their difficulties and enables the civilian companies to participate in the role of the satellite factories for the military production in order to jointly study and produce the military goods and to improve the quality of military hardware. In 1997, after making an on-site tour of 200 manufacturers, having registered for the production, are ready to produce more than 600 items of military goods: the Army's Automobile Depot, Navy's Munitions Factory, Air Force's 2nd Logistic Command, the Chung Shan Institute of Science and Technology, and CSF'S 202nd Plant.

Transference of Technology: The service items-for b.

the Service Center of Technological Transference, the Chung Shan Institute of Science and Technology have been broadened by holding exhibitions of military goods and the demonstration meetings of technological transference, etc. so as to enhance the consultation , guidance, and services for the technological transference. The developed techniques have been so far transferred into civilian factories, so that the domestic industry and technology levels are elevated and the productivity increased. By the end of 1997, 176 items of technological transference and 2,409 assistances of technique in total have been accomplished. As a result, 151 manufacturers are favored.

Assistance in Producing Military Hardware: In c.

view of the fact that the ROCAF has a demand for numerous items of military equipment, the following procedures are incompatible with the manufacturer's investment and the R&D cost: It is prescribed in "the Assistance Procedures for the Military Goods Production of the Public and Private Industry" that the qualified manufacturers of military items are eligible to receive the rights of a 5-year negotiated price and listed price. In order to stabilize the acquisition source of military hardware, gain quality assurance, and protect the rights of the military manufacturers, MND has adopted "the long-term rights" instead of " the 5year Preferential Procedures" since March 1997 in order to select qualified manufacturers year by year, to participate in the research and production of the military hardware. Repair and Maintenance by Businessmen:
According to "the Procedures for the ROCAF's Equipment Repair and Maintenance Awarded to the Public and Private Factories, " a juridical person, the public organization, and a private manufacture both at home and abroad, which has a company, factory, or business certificate approved by the development center of the corporate body or an authorized agreement for the repair and maintenance through a notary, and possesses the repair and maintenance capacity for military items, is eligible to make application to the following units for selection to sign an open repair d.

and maintenance contract, taking over the technical services such as repair, maintenance, assembling, reprocessing for the military goods:
The three Service GHQs, the Chung Shan Institute of Science and Technology, the Reserve Corps Command, the Coast Guard Command, the .

Military Police Command, and the direct subordinate agencies of MND. At present stage, there are more than 13 public and private manufactures such as Asia Airlines, China Shipyard, and the Institute of Industry and Technology, joined in the repair and maintenance for the ROCAF's military items in the following M-41 tank, B-727 passenger transport, Chengkonclass frigate with missiles, etc. Additionally, in order to consolidate the commercial maintenance policy, the MND is ready to offer the following equipment for commercial maintenance contracts:
AH-IW attack helicopters, OH-58D patrol helicopters, and the passenger ship, etc. The qualified domestic and foreign manufacturers are all welcome to bid for repair and maintenance work on ROCAF's military equipment .

Military Sales to Foreign States: For efficiency and e.

economy, the MND has implemented " the Procedures for the Military Sale to Foreign States by the Military Organizations " in March 1996, in which the responsibilities, control, and SOP for the military sale to foreign countries of the ROCAF's military hardware are specified. The

ROCAF's military items for the sales abroad are divided into three categories: The specific military items, the traditional military goods, and the common items both for the military and civilian use. Taking into account national security and overall interests, the MND is cooperating with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Economic Affairs on all matters pertaining to military equipment which are going to sale, the category of the military hardware and the items of the military goods offered to foreign services. Only getting a permission from the competent agency in advance, can the military sale be offered.

## Ii . The Acquisition Of Weaponry And Equipment Policy 1.

a.

The MND has formed an organizational framework to facilitate procurement for various levels in ROCAF, specifically defined the responsibilities, and established a complete procurement system for the Armed Forces in accordance with the following principles: " The Outline for Planning the ROCAF's Military Organization and Force Restructure, " the Reduction of Organizational Levels, the "Centralization of Procurement, " "the Division of Responsibility and Prevention of Cases, " and " the Bribery Delegation of Authority . "

Authority . "
In principle, a centralized authority is set up to deal with the military procurement. It is the responsibility assigned to the Procurement Bureau, MND to manage the domestic procurements of more than NT $30,000,000 and the foreign procurements in excess of over US $ 500,000.

b.

To distribute procurement to avoid overdependence from a single source reduces exposure and risk in military equipment.

c.

The Requirement Committee, the Sorting Committee, the Decision Making Committee, and the  Acquisition-Implementation  Committee  have been established. Thus, the review procedures for the acquisition of military items can be properly focussed. The decision-making process is open, transparent and normal, because a collective decision-making model is adopted with the review, evaluation, and procurement of the major weapons and equipment on the one hand, as well as professional skills and mutual confidence building are established.

It is planned that the foreign manufacturers will be d .

requested to fulfill industrial cooperation in for foreign procurements in excess of US $ 50,000,000
(and amended to more than 0.5 billion NT dollars since October 1, 1997) in order to lay down the proper principles and foundation for industrial cooperation. Upon review and appoved by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the industrial e.

cooperation plan will be integrated into the contracting process which will upgrade the domestic industrial technological level.

## 2. Execution

a.

In 1996 and 1997, 48,174 procurement cases were executed, of which the domestic purchasing amounted to 44,821 cases, while the foreignprocurements totaled 3,264 cases, and military sale totaled 89 cases. The overall total funds expanded was NT $136,267,2709,000. (see Chart 3-4 and Chart 3-5)
b.

c.

Seminars: Seminars are held once a year for domestic and foreign manufacturers respectively.

These seminars were held on May 8, 1996 and July 6, 1997, in which 81 manufacturers participated.

Representative Agent System: "The Procedures for the Registration, Control and Employment of the Foreign Manufacturers' Representatives or Agents in Taiwan by ROC's Military Establishments" was enacted in July 1997 in order to adopt an open, transparent and normal process for the foreign manufacturers' representatives or agents in Taiwan to participate in the ROCAF's military purchasing and to prevent illegal commissions and other outlay. All the foreign manufacturers, companies, or their representatives stationed in Taiwan, participating in the military sales to the ROCAF,
are requested to present their authorized

d .

Information Published for Military Purchasing The information of the procurement cases which are conducted on an open bidding basis will be published in " the Government Procurement Bulletin" with the purpose of making the military purchasing open and transparent.

e.

Training for the Procurement Personnel:
In order to facilitate the training for the procurement personnel, the MND has worked out the procedures for the ROCAF procurement officers' career management. " All the ROCAF's organic procurement persons, who are in charge of the functions pertaining to the purchasing, bidding, contracting, and deliveries-accepting, are listed in the career management, and receive the appropriate education and OJT to develop their knowledgs and practical experience to improve the ROCAF's purchasing system.

Proocessing the Disputes and Appeals:
f .

According to regulations published by the Executive Yuan, known as " the Points to Be

Observed by the Central Government and Various Agencies in the Process of the People's Appeals, "
the MND had implented " the Task Force in Processing the Appeals and Disputes on Purchasing matters " exclusively dealing with the military purchasing disputes, and illustrates questions raised about the process. In the Fiscal Years 1996 and 1997, the MND has evaluated and responded to all the 106 competition cases received.

# Defense Management

## I . Defense Fund Management

On July 1, 1996, the Ministry of National Defense revised " MND Ordinary Public Units Accounting in Coordination with the Central Bank Payment Regulations" to include the defense fund into concentration payment of the Central Bank, so that defense fund can be effectively used and financial affair strictly controlled based on PPBS,
and Armed Forces build-up objective can be achieved in accordance with the restructuring concept and force plan.

## Ii . Defense  Information  Management

The Armed Forces information management, planned in accordance with "Armed Forces Development Policy Planning Report" and "FY 1995-FY 2004 Armed Forces Development Guideline, " focuses on development of information organization, cultivation of talents, system design, application, and standardization. In 1996 and 1997, emphasis was put on regrouping of database, basic network development, and logistic support needed by equipping of new weapons. Concrete achievements are as follows:
Completion of "Armed Forces Internal Net " which has 1.

integrated the networks of MND staff units and service headquarters, and is enhancing its added functions such as WWW, E-mail, FTP site, and NEWS.

2.

The establishment of "Defense Management Database, " establishes files for Armed Forces authorized and actual number of personnel, MOS, budgeting, weapons &
equipment, and logistics data, which have also been included in the "Armed Forces Internal Net" for reference by concerned persons.

## Ii . Logistic Support Management 1. Adjusting Logistics Support Structure

The logistics structure of the Armed Forces was originally designed in an offensive pattern which does not comply with the present strategic direction of "strong defense posture. " In accordance with the "Armed Forces Military Organization and Force Restructuring Plan ," this pattern has been changed into "local logistics."(Note 8) as well as "joint logistics, " Thus, the Headquarters of the Combined Service Forces has managed to combine the common military supply items, maintenance, transportation, real estate management, common engineering, and survey together, while the services headquarters are responsible for their special logistics.

## 2. Establishing Integrated Logistic Support System

For effectively integrating logistics support and management, MND has started from 1991 planning the

integrated logistics support by using the logistics engineering and management science and techniques, so that logistics capability can be established as soon as weapons and equipment are operational. So far, maintenance manuals have been compiled and instructors have been trained for M60-A-3 tanks, CM-11&12 tanks, AH-1W attack helicopters, OH-58D helicopters, Perry-class frigates, Lafayette-class frigates, Knox-class frigates, IDF fighter, F-16s, Mirage 2000-5 fighter, E2T, and anti-air craft and anti-ship missiles. Such work will continue in order to elevate readiness rate of weapons and equipment and to reduce cost.

## 3. Promoting Standardization Concept

As weapons and equipment are diversified, filing and keeping of the huge amount of data is very difficult and inconvenient, and constituted a great burden to logistics agencies. To solve this problem, MND has adopted CALS ( Continuous Acquisition and Life-cycle Support ) to standardize operational concept and increase management efficiency.

## Note:

8.

Area logistics is a kind of logistics support. Logistics units
(troops) deployed in an operational area do not move along with the units they support. Any combat unit deployed in the area is supported by the same area logistics units (troops ) which can also use private support capabilities.

Important National Defense Programming    157 Early in 1950, MND started to review the
"National Defense Law" and worked out the "National Defense Organization Draft Law" and the "National Defense Organization Revision Draft law", in 1952 and 1954 respectively, and submitted them to the Executive Yuan (the cabinet), which sent them to the Legislative Yuan for review. However, this legal process was not completed due to unknown reasons. Later in 1971, the Executive Yuan asked the Legislative Yuan's agreement to withdraw these two drafts and the latter did.

Meanwhile,   the  " National   Defense   Ministry Organization      Law Organization Law of the MND" were issued, which allowed the MND to carry out its functions without difficulties. Thus these two laws were not sent to the Legislative Yuan for review, but MND continued to constantly review these laws.

In March, 1993, the Executive Yuan ordered MND to study and formulate the "National Defense Organization Law" with related departments together.

MND immediately started to restudy and formulate this law with related persons and scholars, and submitted the draft of this law to the Executive Yuan in January, 1994, which, after reviewing, instructed MND to restudy this law in accordance with the trend of constitutional reform. Again, MND invited related persons, scholars, experts, and retired generals to study this law often by conducting case study. Many seminars have been held in order to make this law perfect.

In July, 1997, the National Assembly completed the revision of the constitution. In compliance with the revised constitution, political requirements of a democracy, and military needs, MND completed the
" National Defense Organization Draft Law " by referring to defense structures of advanced nations and reviewing in detail the operation of current national defense structure, and submitted it to the Executive Yuan on September 1, 1997.

On December 31, 1997, the Executive Yuan asked the MND to formulate the draft of "National Defense Law" and the revised version of "National Defense Orgarization Law" at the same time for reviewing of the Legislative Yuan in accordance with the instruction of the President. However, "National Defense Law",
which was drafted under the demand of the President, is similar to the previous " National Defense Organization Law " in their spirits and strutures, regardless the differences of the titles. Under this consideration, MND will follow the instructions of the President and the Exective Yuan to rename the
"National Defense Organization Law"as "National Defense Law". MND will also propose the revised draft of "National Defense Organization Law" as soon as possible; then submit for reviewing of the Legislative Yuan after that. Our intention is to finish the legal process fast.

## 2. Court-Martial Jurisdiction Law

In order to comply with the nation's legal development

and make court-martial more legalized, MND established the "Court-Martial Jurisdiction Law Revision Committee" in June, 1994, inviting experts and scholars in the private sector and representatives from the Ministry of Justice to study revision of the "Court-Martial Jurisdiction Law."
MND completed the draft law lately, and submitted it to the Executive Yuan. Main points of this draft are as follows:
a.

Military law organizations are shifted into the local system. The military Court and military procuratory will be established a citing each independently .

b.

Deleting the right of approval of a judgment and the right of ordering rediscussion by military commanders, and annul the right of detaining by military prosecutors.

c.

Add a special chapter of evidence; trial lawyers can be selected; and add the reasons of evasion of the judge and enlarge the scope of interlocutory appeal.

d. e.

Death sentence and extraordinary appeal will be handled by the supreme court.

Adjust military judicial jurisdiction to handle military and civilian cases separately .

## 3. The Fort And Important Military Zone Law

Following weapons modernization and the change of strategy and tactics of defense operations, MND has constantly lifted or loosened the control of the areas around forts and important military zones. However, based on

regulations of the "The Fort and Important Military Zone Law," part of them are still under military control which affects local development and people's rights. At the end of 1996, an ad hoc team, composed of representatives of various related departments, was formed to study and revise this law. A draft Act has been completed and submitted to the Executive Yuan, which, in turn, just sent it to the Legislative Yuan for review. Main points are as follows a.

Narrow the controlled area around important military zones.

b.

Loosen control matters and standard.

с.

Lift the ban of forbidding people to live in the controlled areas.

d.

Add articles on decreasing or exemption of inheritance tax, giving tax, and land added value tax for people who live in the controlled areas.

Agree to conduct limited overall development in e.

the controlled areas.

## 4. Revising "Armed Forces Criminal Law"

The "Armed Forces Criminal Law" has been used for more than 60 years since it was promulgated in 1929. In order to meet actual needs, strengthen military discipline, maintain effective combat capability, and protect human rights, MND asked the Criminal Law Study Center of the National Political University to make a comparative study of military criminal laws of major nations of the world, which was completed in August, 1996. In addition, MND has also established the " Armed Forces Criminal Law Revision Committee, " which is scheduled to complete the revision

Important National Defense Programming 161 draft in June, 1999.

## Provisions Of Military Education

Military education is the foundation of military buildup. Ever since the Republic of China was founded, the government has established various kinds of military schools. Nowadays, students are awarded degrees just like civilian schools do. However, no special law governing military schools has been formulated so far. As the nature and objective of military schools are different from civilian schools, current regulations of education can not be applied to military schools. In view of this, MND has formulated
"The Provisions of Military Education." MND hopes that it can be passed by the Legislative Yuan, becomes the legal basis, and be included into the whole national education system .

# Refining Structure Of The Armed Forces

## I . Concept

Organization of the Armed Forces is the foundation of developing combat power . In order to meet various needs of conducting defensive operations, MND has, starting from July, 1993, been carrying out its "Ten Year Military Force Objective Program. " Up to now, total number of the Armed Forces has been reduced from 498, 000 to 451,000 (a total of 47,000 has been reduced, and the rate is 9.34%).

Thus, the reduction objective of the first phase has been reached. Later, this program has been renamed "Armed Forces Restructuring Program." Synopsis of this program is as follows:

## 1. Factors Considered

a.

Enemy Threat In recent years, Mainland China continues to increase its defense budget, modernize its weapons, enhance training of missile attack and three-dimensional assault, and actively organize its rapid response force. This clearly indicates that Mainland China intends to invade Taiwan. This seriously threatens the security of Taiwan.

b. 

## Mission Adjustment

In compliance with the national objective of
"Achieving National Reunification by Peaceful and Democratic Means," the overall strategic concept of ROC Armed Forces has been changed to "strong defensive posture and effective deterrence. " Therefore, organizations that are offensive in nature must be adjusted.

c.

National Defense Resources In recent years, the rate of defense budget to the government budget is gradually decreasing, but personnel maintenance expense is increasing as the result of annual pay raise, which affects the operational maintenance fund as well as military investment fund. Such a situation will make defense budget difficult to meet requirements of military build-up and combat readiness if no effective measure is taken. On the other hand, MND will definitely carry out reduction of forces, and the expense saved by reducing personnel will be used to build a small but powerful and modern force.

## 2. Purpose Of The Program

a.

Reduce and integrate high-level organizations and simplify operational procedures, so that administrative efficiency can be increased.

b. 

Adjust force structure to meet the needs of introducing new weapons. Based on operational requirements, a modern and professional force will Important National Defense Programming 165 c.

be established in order to increase command speed and combat efficiency.

Thoroughly carry out the policy of "reducing highlevels and consolidating basic levels." A reasonable rate between officers and NCOs will be established to facilitate career development of voluntary officers and NCOS.

## 3. Main Points Of The Program

a. Adjustment of High-level Organizations
(1) Define missions definitely. The General Staff is responsible for formulating policies and commanding joint operations, while service headquarters are in charge of planning, force build-up, combat readiness, training, and logistics .

Reduce and integrate staff units, eliminate
(2) 
of functions, and simplify redundancy functions.

(3)
Adopt a "joint logistics" system: Headquarters of the Combined Service Forces is responsible for "general purpose" logistics, while service headquarters are in charge of their "exclusive" and "troop" logistics.

## B.

Adjustment of Force Structure Based on general and forward-looking
(1)
considerations, both the combat and service force structures will be adjusted in compliance with the results of operational exercises and conclusions of war-gaming simulation as well

## 1998 National Defense Report 4. Features Of The Program

as various needs of combat forces.

Modernize weapons and equipment and establish information and electronic warfare capacity in order to meet needs of future war.

(2) 
Reduce high-levels and enhance basic-levels.

Mainly reduce administrative and service units of command organizations; the reduced manpower will be used to enhance basic levels of troops in order to solve the problem of under-strength existing before.

a.

Reduce number of personnel but enhance combat capabilities. Actively modernize weapons and equipment in compensation for less manpower in order to get more fire-power and mobility.

Evaluation results indicate that combat power and efficiency of various units will be greater after adjusting force structure and organizational patterns.

b.

Adjust organizations based on functions.

Adjustment of organizations and strength are conducted in accordance with the criterion of manpower evaluation and functions of various units, so that all of them will be able to achieve their missions.

c. d.

Control the progress of reduction and emphasize efficiency. MND and service headquarters will conduct the reduction program simultaneously and check the process and progress periodically in order Important National Defense Programmin to speed the program.

e.

Protect rights and conduct reduction pro Reduction is mainly aimed at high-levels. In we to maintain morale and minimize impact, natural digestion will be adopted by the following patterns:
vacancies left by personnel reassignment and retirement will not be filled; assistance will be given to retired personnel for reemployment; and retirement will be encouraged. Special units will be set up to protect rights and benefits of those who will retire or be re-assigned.

f.

Maintain flexibility and keep adjusting. Plans and programs will inevitably be affected by uncertain factors. In order to carry out the reduction program smoothly and effectively, "the whole process will be divided into different phases. And before each phase ends, review will be conducted according to experiments of organizations and equipment, and changes will be made accordingly.

## Ii . Execution

"The Armed Forces Restructuring Program" has been carried out in three phases from July, 1997. Now, preliminary tables of organization and equipment of various basic strategic units (Note 9) have been completed and the test and evaluation phase will soon begin. The whole reduction program is scheduled to be completed in FY 2001 (two years earlier than originally planned ) . When it is completed, the strength of ROC Armed Forces will be

reduced from the present 451,000 to about 400,000 persons
(reduction rate is 11.6%).

## Note:

9.

A basic strategic unit is composed of several branches of the same service, which also owns command and logistics support capabilities, and can fight independently, so as to achieve its assigned strategic mission. Organization of such a unit is different in various countries. For example, in the army, corps may be a basic strategic unit in some countries, while division or brigade may be a basic strategic unit in other countries; in the navy, a fleet which is composed of more than two squadrons and fights under unified command may be a basic strategic unit; and in the air force, organization is not fixed - a force which has great speed, can fly in very high altitude, and has long-range combat capability is considered to be a basic strategic unit. An air force basic strategic unit is different from those in the army and navy both in combat pattern and process.

# Strengthening The Basic Levels Of Troops

## I . Improving Leadership In The Basic Levels

Strengthening the basic levels of troops is the key factor to refine the Armed Forces and achieve combat readiness.

The strengthening is being conducted by improving school education, career control, and internal management.

Concrete measures are listed in the following.

## 1. Cadre (School) Education

a.

Reprogram curricula concerning command &
leadership, education, and internal management in coordination with student honor system, seminar system, community activities, cadre assistance system, and psychological consultation so as to increase management capability, skills, and faith in the basic levels (company levels).

b.

c.

Conduct field trips to improve training, combatreadiness, command & leadership, and practical management experiences.

Extend ROTC training (basic training 9 weeks, field trip 3 weeks, common knowledge education 4 weeks, specialty and professional education 4-21 weeks, and pre-assignment education 12 weeks ) .

Curricula will be reprogrammed and improved, and

## 171 1998 National Defense Report 172 Career Control 2. 3. Internal  Management Refining Conscription Functions Ii . Revising The "Criterion Of Physical Condition Classification For Eligible Recruits" 1.

the number of candidates who pass the examination will be increased.

Extend the practice time in basic levels for combat officers to enable them to assist and support officers in the basic level after being promoted to field officers.

a.

b.

Conduct evaluation and aptitude test and program command as well as staff functions in the basic level for them to practice based on their MOS and willingness.

Formulate definite regulations for managing male and female officers and men.

a.

Conduct surprise inspection instead of periodical inspection to strengthen control.

b.

Both the Ministry of Interior and MND have jointly revised the "Criterion of Physical Condition Classification for Eligible Recruits, ""Criterion of Physical Condition Classification for Soldiers of the Armed Forces, " and
"Configuration of Normal and Eligible Recruits," so that all eligible recruits, whatever their configuration, will be drafted into the military. They will be trained in accordance with the reprogrammed curricula. After the completion of training, they will be assigned to non combat units to perform administrative and logistical functions. Up to June 10, 1996, a total of 1,075 persons have been trained and assigned to different units with good effectiveness. However, MND has revised the "Criterion of Physical Condition for Eligible Recruits." Starting from January 1, 1998, men whose height is over 195mm or below 156mm have to serve in the national guard, which is different from before. Those who are now serving in the Army will be discharged according to the law .

## 2. Extending Recurits Physical Check-Up Period

Extend recruits physical check-up period from 15 days to 30 days to make sure that those who are physically unable to serve in the military will be eliminated. On June 3, 1996, MND started to check the whole Armed Forces to see if there are any persons who are physically unfit to serve in the military continuously. Those who are physically unfit are sent to the 4th echelon (or above) military hospitals for recheck or medical treatment. A total of 4,213 soldiers have either been eliminated from the military force or sent back to their original units after being treated in military hospitals. (See Table 4-2)

## 3. Implementing Lot-Drawing Strictly

Finishing basic training, trainees of compulsory military service will draw lot, based on their specialty, to determine what units they are going to serve. Under no

circumstances should they refuse to report to the units determined by lot-drawing. In addition, in order to effectively use their specialties, various units can select the trainees two to three times the number than they actually need, and then through lot-drawing to select the trainees they need in order to make this operation fair, just, and ореп.

## 4. Assigning Recruits To Areas Of Their Domicilliary Register

In compliance with social requirements, mobilization difficulties, and family support to the recruits, MND is now studying and trying to assign recruits to units stationed within the area of their domiciliary register. Priority is given to those with a poor family and "those whose brothers are drafted and assigned to off-shore islands. " As a result, more and more recruits are assigned to units within the area of their domiciliary register ( 68.1% for the Army ) .

However, many problems have yet to be solved due to 174 Important National Defense Programming    175 specialty requirements.

## Ii . Enhancing Education Of Military Laws

The purpose of teaching military laws is to ensure that officers and men understand and observe military laws, improve their sense of morality, strengthen discipline, and enhance combat capability. In the first week of basic training, military training centers provide 6 hours of military laws instruction to recruits. Those officers and men on active duty and military employees receive lessons of military laws in their respective units. Judge advocates are sent to various units to teach military laws by way of television shows, asking law questions with awards, speechmaking contests, essay-writing, and so on.

Although military law education can not prevent soldiers from violating laws, it is the most direct way of preventing crime from happening. It is hoped that various kinds of crime can be prevented by effective implementation of teaching military laws.

## Iv . Implementing Rational Management And Education

Most officers and men in the basic levels have a sense of responsibility and observing discipline, However, part of them often violate laws on account of many factors, such as being juvenile delinquencies before being drafted (see table 4-3), poor family education, emotional implications, inexperienced leaders and commanders, and so on. In view of this, MND formulated the "Management and Education

Practice in the Basic Levels of the Armed Forces" in 1995 by asking opinions of major cadres of the Armed Forces, retired servicemen, people's representatives, experts, and scholars and use these opinions as the bases of discplines from July, 1996. Main points are as follows:
Table 4-3 Rate of Recommitting Crimes in 1996 and 1997 by Those Recuits Who Already Had Criminal Records Before Being Drafted

1.

Leaders in various level must content troop management according to their lawful command rights.

2. 3.

Define concrete management measures.

Establish "Evaluation System " to evaluate punishment openly.

4.

Define management discipline in order to correct improper acts by leaders.

176 Since its implementation, improper management and bullying of new comers by senior soldiers have been greatly.

improved. It is estimated that 219 cases of improper management in 1996 have been reduced to 171 in 1997; and 113 cases in the first half of 1997 have been reduced to 58 in the second half of 1997.

## V . Assistance For Psychological Hygiene

As society is changing and economic development is quickening, part of the officers and soldiers are not adept to strictly-disciplined military life. As a result, violation of laws often occur, even including self-damage cases. Therefore, in early 1996, MND asked experts and scholars to offer their comments on how to prevent self-damage in the Armed Forces from happening. MND also plans to increase the number of psychological hygiene assistants to 239 (with the authorized rank up to full colonel). Furthermore, MND also plans to establish Psychological Hygiene Centers in northern, central, and southern Taiwan, Hualien, Penghu, and on the off-shore islands of Kinmen and Matsu respectively, to provide psychological advice to officers and men. Still, psychological assistance training is being conducted to cadres above company level, so that everyone can get psychological assistance. In addition, "Military Service Guide" is compiled and issued to recruits before they are drafted, so they will understand the Armed Forces correctly. Furthermore, experts and scholars are invited to give lectures to chief assistants in company levels on psychological assistance to foster them as the frontline of counseling to enlisted men.

In 1996 and 1997, a total of 104,868 persons have been given psychological assistance by various psychological hygiene centers, and self-damage cases have been reduced to 28 in 1997 from 32 cases in 1996.

## Vi. Prevention Of Casualties In Peacetime

Accidental casualty not only causes loss of visible strength of the Armed Forces but also greatly affects morale and relations between the military and civilians. For the purpose of preventing accidental casualties from happening and for ensuring safety, MND developed and issued the
"Concrete Measures of Preventing Casualties and Violation of Laws" on July 1,1997, and ordered all the Armed Force to thoroughly carry out this regulation. Main points of this regulation are as follows:
1. Emphasize measures of preventing dangerous situations from happening; prepare safety regulations; carry out discipline education thoroughly; and deal with crisis management properly .

2.

Enhance effectiveness of sentries and sentinels; prevent soldiers from not returning to their units after their leave is overdue; and encourage soldiers to report to their units when they commit any crime.

3.

Conduct safety checks frequently; eliminate dead angles of danger; perfect safety assistance network; and carry out safety assistance right on the spot.

Conduct strict control on vehicles; improve drivers' 4.

capabilities; keep drivers' driving licences by their units when not driving; and prevent drivers from driving too fast .

It is estimated that in 1996 and 1997, casualties caused outside of military barracks tops all casualties of the whole Armed Forces. Among these, driving private cars and motorcycles have caused the most serious death. It is hoped that families should advise their draftees to drive carefully when they are on vacation.

## Vi . Strengthening Contact With Families Of Soldiers

Contact with families is an important task of the Armed Forces. As soon as men are drafted into the Army, the sponsoring units immediately brief them and their families on their benefits and rights. After they are sent to troops, their respective units call their families in three days. When they are on leave, their units send letters to their families, telling their families names of their units, their work, and contact methods. In addition, " Friends of Military Personnel Clubs" and "Military Personnel Service Centers" everywhere also contact their families and provide assistance and services. (See Table 4-4)

| Relief         | Contact &   | Service   | by          | Management   | Mediation of   |

| 1997           | 14,852      | 79,742    | 1.067       | 177          | 95             |
| Total          | 30,542      | 210,077   | 2,130       | 423          | 197            |

Table 4-4 Service Results for Military Dependents in 1996 & 1997

## W. Enhancing Anti-Drug Measures

According to estimation made by the National Health Administration in 1996, a total of 6,645 young people (age ranging from 18 to 24)has been found violating anti-drug laws, and 25% of them are found being addicted in drugs.

These young people are causing problems after they have been drafted into the Armed Forces. In order to get rid of this situation, MND has instructed various units to launch the anti-drug campaign by means of military law lectures and " Ju-Kuang Patriotism Education Program. "
Furthermore, anti-drug promotion committees have been established at division level and above to manage anti-drug .

activities. Also, 12 "Seminars on Sanitation" have been set up to educate those who have previous records of drug usage or drug trafficking.

It is estimated that up to the end of 1997, a total of 11,954 recruits have confessed that they have previous records of drug usage or drug trafficking, most of them are amphetamine addicts. After they are drafted into the Armed Forces, a total of 312 persons are drug addicts after they have gone through anti-drug education, and the rate is only 2.61%. It is evident that anti-drug education conducted in the a Armed Forces is very effective.

# Strengthening Military Education

## I . Defining Professional Military Education System

As the 2nd generation of weapons is operational and
"The Armed Force Organization and Strength Adjustment Program" is being carried out, ROC Armed Forces tend to develop toward "Professionalism." In the past, curricula of various military schools and colleges have been designed to cover a wide-range of subjects. Such a situation has made the students learn so many subjects that they did not master any, which affects modernization for lack of professionalism . After deliberate consideration and review ,
MND decided to reduce common subjects and increase professional ones. Based on mission and characteristics of military schools, separate cadre development, " Armed Forces Organization and strength Adjustment Program,"
and requirements of defensive operations, MND has consolidated professional military education into the following four categories: political warfare, personnel, intelligence, and logistics, with the aim of stressing professionalism and improving quality of professional military education.

The separate cadre career development program is designed to give cadres an opportunity to develop their

career along two channels instead of just one like they did before : the command channel and the staff channel. On the command channel (most cadres have developed their career in the past), a cadre can start his career from the company commander, battalion commander, brigade commander, all the way up to the position of chief or deputy chief of a department with the rank of lieutenant general. On the staff channel, a cadre can start his career from the position of chief of a unit equal to a company all the way up to the position of chief of a professional department with the rank of lieutenant general. A cadre's willingness, attitude, schooling, specialty, and experience are of course, required as he goes higher and higher along this channel.

## Ii . Integration Of Military Academies

For the purpose of facilitating concentration of educational resources and improvement of quality of education, MND in 1994 consolidated various logistics courses and schools into one logistics school, and integrated 31 other military academies and schools into 24 and one training center. In order to further consolidate educational resources and meet the requirements of Armed Forces reduction, MND plans to further reduce the 24 military academies and schools to 20. Departments in various military schools not much related to military will be closed .

Fund saved by reducing personnel will be used to improve education .

## Iii . Restructure Of Army Nco Schools 182

In FY 1999, Army NCO schools will be restructured into "composite senior high schools. " Curricula will be designed to be diverse and flexible, so that students can select special courses they like. Assistance will be provided to students to select a set a complete courses whose contents are mainly connected with NCO specialties in various branch schools. This will enable students to get class C
certificates of techniques before graduating. (See Table 4-5)

## Iv . Developing Instructional Software

Development of doctrine has a far-reaching effect on military build-up and employment of forces; it is the primary work of developing software of military education. For the purpose of enhancing the function of doctrine development, MND has set up a special group in charge of

doctrine and promoting information developing of education in order to save manpower and share educational resources. MND plans to:
1.

ask the National Defense Management College to complete the design of educational administration information system in 1999, and develop common software to be used by military schools, which should list their requirement of computer hardware and software in their execution programs and try to get them year by year, and ask the Chung Shen Institute of Science and Technology to help all military schools establish administrative, academic, and military networks before the year 2000, and complete digital data of instruction in the year of 2001, which will be used by both teachers and the students.

## V . Promoting Academic Studies

Academic studies are designed to foster studies, improve quality of education, and cultivate outstanding personnel. (See Table 4-6) Such outstanding officers will be able to understand the trend of war and master strategy and tactics, which will be used as the basis of conducting military build-up and training. In view of this, MND holds seminars every year, entrust private academic institute to hold seminars on national defense ( military ) and special topics (See Table 4-7), increase educational facilities, and improve academic study environment.

# Strengthening Defensive Operations

## I . Enhancing C31 And Electronic Warfare Capabilities

Time is the key to win victory in war. Particularly under the fact that Taiwan is separated from the communist controlled Mainland China by only a strip of water. For the purpose of gaining more early-warning time, MND is integrating various intelligence, observation, and detection systems in accordance with the reduction program, simplifying command and control levels, and actively electronic hard and software production increasing capacity, frequency spectrum technique, as well as electronic detection, electronic attack, and electronic protection capabilities so as to gain electronic warfare superiority .

## Ii . Improving Rapid Response Capability

In order to prevent the enemy from launching surprise attack successfully, a rapid response force has been activated which will be deployed locally and employed under integrated command and mobility. Command capability will be gradually increased through yearly training and exercises. Evaluation shows that rapid response

capability has been greatly enhanced to meet any
 -
contingencies.

## Iii . Refining Military Training

Training is the fundamental task for military build-up and achieving combat readiness, and it must comply with military policies and mission. At the present time, the main battlefield of ROC defensive operations has been changed to the Taiwan Strait, and so the focus of military training has been on island defense and defensive operations. For the purpose of ensuring safety, MND, in October, 1997, called a meeting attended by responsible officers of various training units to deeply review factors affecting training safety in the past two years. As a result, six measures have been devised to improve training safety.

## Iv . Conducting Military Exercises

Military exercises are designed to test the adaptability and feasibility of operations plans and programs as well as advance operations skills of participants. They must be carried out without undue stop. In FY 1996 and 1997 respectively, a total of 164 of anti-landing, anti-airborne, anti-subversion, and service and joint operations exercises were conducted. Reviews of these exercises have been included in the training instructions of FY 1998 for reference. (See Table 4-8 for scheduled training in 1998)

# Protection Of Rights And Benefits Of Military Personnel

## I . Accelerating Rebuilding Of Old Dependents Quarters

Since the start of rebuilding of old dependents quarters in 1980, a total of 162 communities of old dependents quarters have been rebuilt according to rebuilding plans, and 86 communities are being rebuilt or scheduled to be rebuilt. (See Table 4-9) Still a total of 543 communities can not be rebuilt currently due to problems of the land, fund, and willingness of dependents themselves. Therefore, MND formulated " The Regulation of Rebuilding Deteriorated Quarters for Military Dependents", which has been passed by the Legislative Yuan. It was formally carried out on February 5, 1996.

"The Regulation of Rebuilding Deteriorated Quarters for Military Dependents" plans to build 161 communities
(93,130 houses) in nine years. These houses will be cheaply sold to the original military dependents, illegal occupants registered by the government, and middle & low-income civilians. Land left over will be turned over to local governments for use of city development. (see Table 4-10) A Reconstruction Fund will be created by money earned by selling land. It not only does not increase financial burden

to the central government but can also save more than NT $
250,000,000,000 of which more than NT $ 150,000,000,000 will be used to help settle low-income people. When the whole reconstruction program is completed, nearly 100,000 civilians will be benefited in addition to military dependents. In order to ensure quality of construction; special and professional organizations have been set up, responsible for all affairs concerning the construction including design, plans, implementation of construction, monitoring, reception, and so on, so that all possible defaults can be avoided.

Planned Use of Land Left by Removal of Table 4-10 Military Dependents Quarters
Since the implementation of " The Regulation of Rebuilding Deterioated Quarters for Military Dependents," a total of 5 communities (854 households) in Taipei County has been resettled. Meanwhile, contracts have been signed to rebuild houses for military dependents living in Taipei City, Taoyuan County, and other counties. When completed, a total of 16,611 households of old military dependents, communities in 11 cities and counties will be resettled.

In order to shorten the rebuilding period and create investment opportunities for the public sector, a regulation of encouraging private companies to participate in the rebuilding had been ratified by the Executive Yuan and was carried out on November 25, 1997.

## 194 Raising Pension Ii .

Starting from January 1, 1997, volunteer officers' and men's pension-payment have been included in the
"Management Committee of Retirement Pension for Civil Servants." In addition to doubling the basic number of pension (each basic number is the number of a monthly pay), parents or spouses of those who have died on official duty, or parents whose only son has died accidentally or of illness, or spouses who do not have sons, will receive pension as long as they live; children of the dead will receive pension until they are 20 years old or they have graduated from college; and the bereaved families of those who have died on active duty for more than 20 years will receive half of the basic number of pension as long as they live.

## Ii . Gaining Continued Preferential Treatment For Soldiers And Their Dependents

In order to continue to gain preferential treatment, MND has formulated " The Provision of Preferential Treatment for Soldiers and Their Dependents, " so that soldiers can continue to be exempt from tax and their dependents cna enjoy preferential treatment for public utility. (See Table 4-11)

## Iv . Increasing Pays

In observance of regulations of the National Personnel Administration Bureau, MND regulates pays for military personnel as well as employees in the military and submit them to the Executive Yuan for approval.

For the purpose of raising morale and encouraging officers and men to work on the off-shore islands, high mountains, or other remote areas, MND began to issue
"local allowances" to those personnel working in the abovementioned places in July, 1991. Owing to restraint of defense budget, the scale of such allowance is far lower than that of civil servants. In 1996, MND raised such allowances to about 33% but are still far less than the civil servants. (Sec Table 4-12 ) MND will try to raise such allowances gradually.

Special duty allowances are set and raised in terms of the degree of danger, difficulty and physical demand. For Important National Defense Programming 197 keeping senior outstanding pilots to fly new-generation fighters, flying allowances have been raised from 10% to 30%, other special allowances are also considered to be raised to improve living standard and raise morale of military personnel.

# Respecting People'S Rights

## I . Narrowing The Areas Around Forts

In view of the change of social environment and facilitating overall economic development and security of the nation, MND continues to review and narrow the areas around forts. In 1996 and 1997, MND lifted control of 10 areas around the following forts: Shamaoshan in Penghu, Chimuwu, No.18 high land at Sokang, NO.13&30 high land at Shanshui, NO.17 high land at Wukan, Liangwen Harbor, Hsuchiushan in Keelung City, Patoutsi, and Panpingshan in Kaohsiung City. MND also narrowed the areas around six forts. Total area being narrowed is 2,319 hectares.

## Ii . Easing Construction On Military-Controlled Land

The purpose of restricting construction on militarycontrolled land is to develop effectiveness of weapons and equipment and protect lives and properties of the people nearby. However, in consideration of people's rights and benefits as well as local development, MND examines such restrictions from time to time and tries to ease them without affecting security .

In 1996 and 1997, MND lifted one controlled area in Chiayi City, and narrowed the size of some controlled areas located in "Wuchuan Village, Tayuan Hsiang, Taoyuan Coanfy, " "Shalun, Tayuan Hsiang, Taoyuan County, "
" Kuolin Village, Luchu Hsiang, Taoyuan County, "
"Wutsoli, Chingshui Town, Taichung County, "Yangtsuli Tafuliao, Chungshui Town, Taichung County, "Shanpi Village, Shenkuang Hsiang, Taichung County, "
" Shihsanliao, Putsichuan, Taya Hsiang, Taichung County, " "Liulin Village, Tachuwei, Shuishang Hsiang, Chiay County, ""Taotsiyuan, Soying, Kaohsiung City, "
"Hsiulin Hsiang and Hsincheng Hsiang, Hualien City and County, " Chialulanshan, Chialulan Village, Peinan Hsiang, Fukuangli, Fufengli, Taitung city and County,"
"Nankang, Taipei City, " "Chingshanli, Yangmingshan, Taipei City, " and "Chungcheng District, Keelung City. "
The total area of land lifted or narrowed is 1,700 hectares.

## Ii . Releasing ( Narrowing)  Mountain And Coastal Military-Controlled Areas

According to "The National Security Law," part of the coastal and mountain areas are classified as "Controlled Areas, " which are divided into " Constant Controlled Areas," and "Specific Controlled Areas" depending on their nature (Note 10). These areas have been made public.

Control of coastal areas is carried out by the Coast Guard, while control of mountain areas are implemented by the police. People must apply for permission to enter these controlled areas. However, for facilitating travel and

development and for securing national defense and order. MND and MOI jointly review these areas each year. Up to December, 1997, 96 "constant controlled areas" in the mountains has been lifted; coastal "constant controlled areas" around Chinshan, Shuiwei, and Fukuichiao have been shifted to "specific controlled areas;" and coastal constant controlled areas have been narrowed.

## Note 10:

Civilians Solving Land Disputes Between the Military and IV .

## Private Land Occupied By The Military 1. Military Land Occupied By Civilians 2. Properly Handling People'S Appeals And National Compensation Cases V . People'S Appeals 1.

As MND is reducing the scale of Armed Forces and integrating military camps, it is in the process of reviewing and returning private land to the people. For those pieces of land that can not be returned to the people on account of mission requirements. MND is trying to buy them or signing contract to rent them. Since 1992, MND has returned a total of 135 hectares of land occupied respectively by North Wutu, Tungtien, Tawo, and Chuyuan military camps, and purchased a total of 225 hectares located in 187 places.

It is caused most by poor management and unclear division in the past. In order to protect national property, MND has, starting from 1992, regained a total of 82 hectares located around the Yutienling military camp, Kuangchi training field, Hsiaokangshan training field, and Sokang military camp.

In order to protect people's rights and benefits. MND
established a "Petition Deliberative Committee" in accordance with Article 26 of the Law of Appeal. This committee is specifically responsible for dealing with appeals which might be made by people due to administration negligence or inappropriate administrative penalties. Any one who thinks that his right has been unlawfully violated by the military, may make appeals in compliance with legal procedures accompanied by necessary documents. In 1996 and 1997, there were 316 appeal cases of which 243 cases were rejected, 54 cases were retried, and 19 cases were either transferred, cancelled, or concluded.

## 2. National Compensation

In order to carry out "National Compensation Law, "
MND and service headquarters (including Armed Forces Reserve Command and Military Police Command ) have
" National Compensation Deliberative established Committee" to manage national compensation cases. From January, 1996, to December, 1997, MND had received 63 cases of requesting national compensation, of which 56 cases were concluded, and 7 cases are in the process of deliberation .

## Vi . Increasing The Coroners' Credibility

In order to find out the real causes of death caused by accidents, handle death cases fairly, and dismiss doubts of families, examination of corpse is conducted by judicial doctors directed by military prosecutors. And for the purpose of increasing credibility of examination by coroners, MND established "The Judicial Doctors Center" by grouping related personnel and facilities from the National Defense Medical Center, Tri-Service General Hospital, and Military Law Bureau together. Furthermore, MND also invites judicial doctors from the Criminal Police Department, High Prosecutor's Office, and local related departments to support examination (re-examination) of bodies of military personnel. In 1996 and 1997, 22 cases of re-examination were conducted by the "Judicial Doctors Center"satisfactorily .

# Strengthening Environment Protection

## 1. Disposal Of Junks

In order to prevent junks from affecting environment, health, and people's living condition, MND started training junks disposal technicians under the assistance of the National Environment Protection Administration. In 1996 and 1997, 31 persons were awarded the license of Class A
Waste Water Disposal Technician, and 30 persons got the license of Class B Junks Disposal Technician. In addition, MND has prepared NT $ 320,000,000 for the purpose of employing technicians of qualified companies of dispose of garbage, salvaged tires, transformers, condensers, and contaminated waste dumped by military hospitals.

## 2. Noise Control

In order to reduce noise, MND has installed soundproof facilities near airbases, military factories, and military construction sites. MND has also coordinated with the National Environmental Protection Administration and the Civil Aviation Bureau to install noise-measuring network near airbases to reduce noise. In 1996 and 1997, MND
invested NT $280,000,000 to construct noise-reduction buildings for engine-warm-up on Hsinchu, Shuinan
(Taichang), Ching-Chuan-Kang (Taichung), Chiayi, and Hualien airbases, and install noise-reducing monitoring network  on  Taoyuan,  Hsinchu,  Ching-Chuan-Kang
(Taichung), Air Force Academy, and Taitung airbases.

Later, when "Supplemental Principle of Installing Noise

Reduction Devices to Owners of Legal Buildings Around Airfields" is carried out, MND will help civilians install the said devices.

Such plans are being carried out . Up to 1997, MND has invested NT $ 410,000,000 in this respect, completing construction of 24 polluted-water processing plants and installing polluted-water processing facilities. In the future, MND will continue to improve pollution prevention by refering to the over-all plans prepared by the Environmental Protection Consulting Company.

# Providing Services To The People

## I. Disaster  Relief

Loving and assisting people is the traditional spirit of ROC Armed Forces. Before the "National SAR Agency" is established, the Armed Forces are responsible for conducting disaster relief and assisting in reconstruction immediately after the disaster.

At present, the Rescue Coordination Center (RCC) of the Armed Forces takes charge of search and rescue of air and ship accidents within the Taipei Flight Intelligent Zone. It also maintains contact with the rescue coordination centers of nearby countries to conduct international relief work.

In 1996 and 1997, a total of about 150,000 troops, more than 700 airplanes, 100 ships, and 1,700 military vehicles were used to conduct search and rescure of disaster. (See Table 5-3 and Table 5-4 )

## Ii . Assisting People In Harvesting

In compliance with requests of farmers, the Armed Forces offers bi-annual assistance of harvesting, which has contributed greatly to prosperity of rural areas. As rural environment has changed and mechanization becomes popular, the Armed Forces have begun using machines to help farmers harvest starting since second harvesting in 1996. It is estimated that in 1996 to 1997, a total of 2,192 soldiers was dispatched and a total area of harvested rice field was 10,365 hectares; and more than 12,658 farmer's families were benefitted. (See Table 5-5)

## 皿. Supporting Vaccination

Since the government carried out national health insurance, it is no longer necessary for the Armed Forces to continue providing "volunteer medical treatment" to the general public. With exception of Kinmen, Matsu, and Penghu, which lack medical resources. MND has cancelled routine "volunteer medical treatment" activity since June, 1997, and shifted to supporting local governments to prevent contagious diseases from spreading, as well as conduct emergent medical treatment. In 1996 and 1997, the Armed Forces employed more than 53,000 soldiers and more than 2,800 vehicles to help stopping pig infectious disease and prevent Dengue Fever from spreading.
