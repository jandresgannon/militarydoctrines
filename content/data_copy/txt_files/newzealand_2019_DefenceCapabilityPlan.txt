## Minister  of Defence Foreword


**Hon Ron Mark**
Minister of Defence


I am pleased to announce the release of the Defence
_Capability Plan 2019. The release of this Plan concludes a_
series of foundational reviews which align defence policy and
planned investments with the Coalition Government’s priorities,
including the Pacific Reset, and its commitment to safeguarding
and providing resilience for the nation’s wellbeing.

The capabilities set out here maintain the indicative planned
investment in Defence signaled by the Defence Capability
_Plan 2016. However this Plan goes further, prioritising new_
investments to better address New Zealand’s strategic
environment, and highlighting investments which will be
required in the longer term. The Plan will be delivered in a
fiscally responsible manner, with the indicative capabilities
and costs outlined here being subject to robust scrutiny prior
to Cabinet consideration of business cases, and funding being
available through the Budget process.

Together with the Strategic Defence Policy Statement 2018,
this Plan sets the foundation of Defence for the Coalition
Government. The Strategic Defence Policy Statement
_2018 outlined how the Defence Force provides value to the_
community, nation and world, and raised the priority placed
on the Defence Force’s ability to operate in the South Pacific
to the same level as New Zealand’s territory, the Southern
Ocean and Antarctica; this Plan provides a vision for the
capabilities that will deliver on the Policy Statement, and for an
enhanced and sustainable Defence Force.

The Defence Capability Plan 2019 comes at a critical point in
time, with anticipated decisions likely to shape the Defence
Force for the next thirty years or more. The significance of this
undertaking is substantial; however its value to New Zealand,
as outlined in this document, is greater than the investment
required. To realise that value, this plan maintains the $20 billion
in capital investment out to 2030, first signalled in the Defence
_White Paper 2016. This includes $5.8 billion invested in Defence_
Capabilities since 2014, with $2.4 billion being committed to the
P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft.

The decision by the Coalition Government to purchase four
P-8A Poseidon aircraft to replace the aging P-3K2 Orion fleet
has laid a strong foundation. This purchase demonstrates
a strong commitment to acquire combat-capable, flexible
capabilities that can support security for New Zealand and the
South Pacific, whilst also contributing to efforts to reinforce the
international rules-based order.

Other major platforms which underpin the Defence Force are
now reaching the end of their service lives. The C-130H Hercules
fleet and the New Zealand Army’s vehicle fleet have provided
significant value in operations ranging from Antarctica and East
Timor, to the Middle East. Preserving these vital contributions
through investment in modern, contemporary capabilities is the
highest priority for delivering this Plan


The range of operations conducted by the New Zealand
Defence Force in relation to its size will require innovative
capability solutions. This will necessitate pairing proven
technologies with unique ways of operating suited to
New Zealand’s specific strategic environment. This will include
responding to the impacts of climate change, which will
continue to test the security and resilience of our community,
our nation, the South Pacific, and the world. These challenges
were highlighted in the 2018 Defence Assessment – The
_Climate Crisis: Defence Readiness and Responsibilities. Early_
thinking on an enhanced sealift capability to replace HMNZS
_Canterbury will mean that New Zealand is well placed to_
respond and will enhance New Zealand’s resilience against
risks to our national wellbeing.

Significantly, capability decisions will need to consider the
fundamental changes to the ways in which militaries operate
across the world. As the rate of technological change
accelerates, so too will the complexity of our strategic
environment. Staying in line with these technologies will
be crucial to ensuring our Defence Force remains properly
resourced and positioned.

For these reasons the Plan includes planned investment in
space-based systems, analytical intelligence capabilities, and
semi-autonomous and remotely operated technologies. The
Plan also reinforces the importance of digital capabilities as
critical enablers across operations, with greater investment in
cyber capabilities.

This Plan also gives greater emphasis to the sustainability of
the Defence Force than previous versions. Capabilities have
been prioritised to provide value for money, and wide ranging
support to other agencies, delivering a broad range of outcomes
to New Zealand. The recently purchased dive and hydrographic
vessel, HMNZS Manawanui, has demonstrated that the
delivery of defence capabilities can be undertaken in a fiscally
responsible manner, while also enhancing those capabilities to
better meet the demands of the future.

I am confident that New Zealand’s Defence agencies will
rise to the challenge of delivering this Capability Plan. The
review of Defence’s procurement practices, completed by Sir
Brian Roche in May 2018, demonstrates the considerable
success of Defence’s commitment towards improvements
to investment delivery. These improvements are an explicit
recognition of the scale and importance of the capital portfolio.

We have an obligation to ensure that New Zealand remains
secure and prosperous, that we meet our commitments to our
partners, uphold and represent our nation’s values globally,
and that we are prepared to address the challenges that face
our future generations. The Defence Capability Plan 2019
delivers on that obligation, and will ensure that the Defence
Force is able to deliver value to the community, nation, and

#### Executive Summary


-----

1. The Defence Capability Plan 2019 sets out the indicative
planned investments in the New Zealand Defence Force
out to 2030, while further identifying potential investments
to be made after 2030. Delivering on these investments will
provide the Defence Force with the capabilities required to
give effect to the Government’s policy intentions, outlined in
the Strategic Defence Policy Statement 2018.

2. The Defence Capability Plan 2019 has been jointly
prepared by the Ministry of Defence and the New Zealand
Defence Force. A broad range of other Government
agencies have provided input and assurance. This
Capability Plan builds on earlier versions, including the
_Defence Capability Plan 2016, incorporating changes_
necessary to deliver the Strategic Defence Policy
_Statement 2018._

3. The planned investments signalled here maintain the
$20 billion programme of capital investment out to 2030,
while improving the overall ability of the Defence Force
to respond to the strategic environment. Furthermore, for
the first time potential investments have been identified
to provide for the next generation change to the Defence
Force, beginning in 2030. These initiatives, informed by
long-term planning and development, will be explored in
detail in the Defence White Paper planned for 2022.

4. Extending long-term planning in Defence allows for
sustainable, high-value investments to be considered.
Taken alongside recent commitments, the Defence
_Capability Plan 2019 provides for the replacement and_
regeneration of all major Defence capabilities.

5. The Strategic Defence Policy Statement 2018 described
the value that the Defence Force provides for the
community, the nation, and the world, delivered through
the current and future capabilities it maintains. The nature
of these contributions, and how capabilities are used to
fulfil New Zealand’s Defence policy, is outlined in the
following chapter. Either independently or with partners, the
New Zealand Defence Force is able to respond to events
which impact New Zealand’s wellbeing, from civil defence
emergencies at home, to global threats to the international
rules-based order that we rely on for our way of life.

##### Delivering on Government policy

6. Consistent with the Coalition Government’s Pacific Reset,
key changes to this Defence Capability Plan are focused
on increasing the effectiveness of the Defence Force to
operate in the South Pacific. Foremost in these changes
is increasing New Zealand’s capacity to respond as the
demand for assistance grows, with improved capabilities to
move personnel, stores and equipment.

7. The means by which these priorities will be delivered
are outlined in Chapter Three, alongside plans for new
capabilities needed to address the challenges identified in
the Strategic Defence Policy Statement 2018. Central to
this is the inclusion of capabilities to improve New Zealand’s
maritime domain awareness; a vital component of
New Zealand’s security and prosperity. This will be
achieved through improved and dedicated surveillance
capabilities that provide a broad appreciation of maritime
activities, from the Southern Ocean to the South Pacific.


##### Preparing for the future

8. By 2030 the environment within which the New Zealand
Defence Force is expected to respond will have changed
considerably. Driven by climate change and competing
national interests, the frequency and diversity of security
events are expected to have increased. New Zealand will
require a Defence Force which can provide Government
with a broad range of options, including undertaking its
roles concurrently if required.

9. In keeping with the Government’s expectations of Defence,
this includes being able to respond independently to events
in the South Pacific if required. However, the need to
continue to operate with our partners to further common
interests will continue. The response options, including
enhanced sealift and airlift capabilities, and growth in
the size of the New Zealand Army, provided through the
delivery of this plan are detailed in Chapter Four.

10. To meet the principles of the Strategic Defence Policy
_Statement 2018, while balancing cost, viability of delivery and_
operational needs, the integration of modern technologies
and practices have been outlined in Chapters Six and Seven.
Cyber, intelligence, semi-autonomous and space-centred
technologies will provide New Zealand with a Defence Force
that is resourced and prepared to operate in a modern
strategic environment. These technologies will also lower
risk to New Zealand Defence personnel, and improve the
efficiency and effectiveness of the Force as a whole.

11. To ensure the long-term sustainability of the New Zealand
Defence Force, improvements will continue to be made to
the way Defence manages its logistics and its workforce.
Furthermore, new approaches to delivering essential services
will be considered, including working with commercial partners
to deliver information technologies necessary for the operation
of the New Zealand Defence Force.

##### Planned investment in Defence capabilities

12. The specific investments planned for major capabilities,
within the air, maritime, land and information domains are
outlined in Chapter Seven. Providing the purpose, timing
and estimated cost range of each investment, the Defence
_Capability Plan 2019 offers a transparent, informative_
indication of Defence priorities to the New Zealand public,
and to our Defence partners overseas. Providing an outline
of planned investments also ensures that Defence is well
situated to work with industry to deliver on this Plan.

13. The timing, description, and cost of capability investments
provided in this plan are indicative, and subject to
approval by Cabinet. Investment intentions out to 2030
are subject to individual business cases justifying the
investment, and funding being available through the
budget process, taking into account other Government
priorities. Indicative investments planned for commitment
between 2030 and 2035 have been included to allow for
considered, long-term planning for the Defence Force’s
future needs. These capabilities will be reassessed ahead

#### Community, Nation and World


-----

14. The Strategic Defence Policy Statement 2018 set
out the Coalition Government’s strategic policy for
Defence. Through an assessment of the global
strategic environment and its implications for
New Zealand, the Policy Statement defined the roles,
priorities and principles expected of the New Zealand
Defence Force. This Plan sets out the capabilities
required to fulfil these expectations.

##### Defence outcomes: Delivering value  to the Community, Nation and World

15. Defence supports New Zealand’s security, resilience
and wellbeing across a broad range of activities.
In particular, Defence:

###### Community

Supports New Zealand’s community and environmental
wellbeing and resilience.

###### Nation

Promotes a safe, secure, and resilient New Zealand,
including on its borders and approaches.

Contributes to maintaining New Zealand’s prosperity via
secure air, sea and electronic lines of communication,
and secure access to space-based services.

###### World

Contributes to the maintenance of the international
rules-based order.

Contributes to New Zealand’s network of strong
international relationships.

##### Principles underpinning  New Zealand’s Defence policy

16. The Strategic Defence Policy Statement 2018
articulated several fundamental high-level expectations
of the Defence Force. The delivery, introduction and
operation of the capabilities in this Capability Plan will
be undertaken in a manner that ensures the following
principles are adhered to:

16.1 Defence is combat-capable, flexible and ready:
The core purpose of the Defence Force is to
deliver military effects. Combat capabilities are
of fundamental importance. The Defence Force
forms a core component of New Zealand’s
broader national resilience, typically operating
alongside and in support of other agencies.
The Defence Force’s capabilities enable it to
deliver a broad range of activities that support
New Zealand’s overall wellbeing.


16.2 Defence personnel are highly trained
professionals: Whether in regular force, reserve
or civilian roles, Defence Force personnel are
professionally trained and skilled to succeed.

16.3 Defence has the resources to meet the
Government’s operational and strategic priorities:
The Defence Force is equipped and resourced
to meet the operational requirements placed on it
by the Government, and Defence is positioned to
respond to the changing strategic environment.

16.4 Defence operates in ways that maintain public
trust and confidence: Defence Force activities
are subject to civilian control, exercised through
the Minister of Defence and the Cabinet more
generally. Defence must be transparent and open
with the New Zealand public.

16.5 Defence embodies and promotes New Zealand’s
values: Domestically and offshore, Defence
promotes New Zealand’s enduring values.
Defence also operates in accordance with
these values. Internationally, Defence must
be an agent of New Zealand’s independent
foreign policy, act to promote New Zealand
as a good international citizen, and support
the international rules-based order. Defence
operates in accordance with both domestic and
international law, including the Law of Armed
Conflict and International Humanitarian Law.

16.6 Defence is a credible and trusted international
partner: In supporting New Zealand’s interests,
Defence makes valued, credible contributions to
New Zealand’s international security partnerships.
This includes meeting New Zealand’s
commitment as an ally of Australia. The Defence
Force adds value to international coalitions and
other joint operations, and is interoperable with
New Zealand’s key security partners.

17. The priorities and principal roles of the Strategic
_Defence Policy Statement 2018 describe the Coalition_
Government’s expectations for the Defence Force.
Equally, capability provides the means through which
the Defence Force meets these expectations, as
described below.


-----

##### Community

18. The Coalition Government is committed to putting
wellbeing at the heart of its policies, including its Defence
policies. The New Zealand Defence Force is a major
contributor to safeguarding and providing resilience to the
nation’s wellbeing.

19. The capabilities of the Defence Force are unique
within New Zealand. Given this, they must also
be complementary to, and ready to support, other
Government agencies towards all-of-Government
objectives. This includes the New Zealand Police,
Ministry for Primary Industries, Ministry of Civil Defence
and Emergency Management, Customs New Zealand,
the Department of Conservation, the Ministry of Health
and others as needed.

###### Contribute to national, community and environmental wellbeing and resilience, and whole- of-Government security objectives

20. Following civil emergencies, the New Zealand Defence
Force’s sealift, airlift and land transport capabilities allow
rapid responses through the provision of supplies and
personnel. Where necessary, these capabilities are able
to evacuate at risk populations. Medical and engineering
capabilities can also provide relief, particularly in the
critical early phases of an operation.

21. Air surveillance and dive and hydrographic capabilities
allow for the inspection of critical infrastructure on land
and at sea, including in isolated or inaccessible locations.
Defence infrastructure, including high frequency and
satellite communication capabilities, also provides
resilience to systems of national importance, allowing
for emergency services to maintain communications
during crises.

22. These same capabilities, with the naval patrol force,
are able to provide the Department of Conservation
with the means to protect the environment, including in
environmentally sensitive areas such as Fiordland, the
sub-Antarctic Islands and the Kermadec Islands.

23. The New Zealand Army provides counter-explosive
and counter-terrorist responses domestically. In
environmental disasters, land forces also support
displaced populations and assist with managing natural
hazards, such as flood waters, debris and landslides.
First response emergency services are provided through
rural and aviation firefighting capabilities, deployable
health task groups and temporary accommodation.

24. The New Zealand Defence Force also contributes to
community wellbeing through the use of its people and its
estate. These capabilities are utilised to deliver the Limited
Service Volunteer scheme, to provide motivational, skillsbased education to young at risk New Zealanders.


##### Nation

25. Government’s highest priority for the Defence Force is its
ability to operate and undertake tasks in New Zealand’s
territory, including its Exclusive Economic Zone, and
neighbourhood from the South Pole to the Equator.

###### Defend New Zealand’s sovereignty and territory, and contribute to protecting New Zealand’s critical lines of communication

26. New Zealand’s territory and sovereign rights extend from
the heart of our nation to the boundaries of our Exclusive
Economic Zone and extended continental shelf claims.
Defending sovereignty across these areas ensures not
only the protection of our national resources, but also that
New Zealand’s national values are upheld.

27. Patrol capabilities at sea and in the air help ensure that
marine protected areas remain untouched, and that our
fisheries remain sustainable. They also work collectively
to identify, intercept, board and inspect vessels of
interest, and assist those in distress. These capabilities
draw on intelligence support to ensure the efficient and
targeted use of Defence resources.

28. The Defence Force protects New Zealand’s critical lines
of communication through the safeguarding of those who
use them. Maritime search and rescue, monitoring of
our borders, and participation in constabulary operations
provide for the safety of maritime trade and the many
recreational users of the waters around New Zealand and
in the region. Capabilities including HMNZS Manawanui
are also able, where necessary, to provide monitoring of
sea lanes, ports and harbours.

29. Capabilities introduced under this plan will also provide
greater resilience for New Zealand’s digital and spacebased lines of communication, by increasing our
awareness of space-based activities in our region.


-----

###### Conduct a broad range of operations in the South Pacific, including leading operations when necessary, to protect and promote regional peace, security and resilience

30. The Strategic Defence Policy Statement 2018 recognised
that, as a Pacific nation, New Zealand’s security and
wellbeing is intrinsically bound to the peace and stability of
the South Pacific. Importantly, the Statement also raised
the priority placed on the Defence Force’s ability to operate
in the South Pacific to the same level as New Zealand’s
territory, the Southern Ocean and Antarctica.

31. High-readiness contingent capabilities are maintained by
the Defence Force to respond to events in the Pacific,
from humanitarian and disaster relief to security and
stability operations.

32. Being prepared to operate independently or to lead
peace and security operations in the Pacific requires a
Defence Force that is able to operate effectively within
the air, maritime, land and information domains. This
force needs to act cohesively within potentially highrisk environments, inserting and sustaining diverse
capabilities, preventing or minimising conflict, and
supporting local communities to build security.

33. Capabilities must be ready to gain access to islands
via the sea. This may require maritime mine countermeasures, inspection of infrastructure, and the surveying
of sea routes. Air surveillance capabilities also provide
situational awareness, identifying the scale and impact of
an event, movements of people and the state of critical
infrastructure, including roads, ports and airfields.

34. Once established, access allows amphibious forces to
operate. Landing craft and helicopter forces operating
from sealift vessels, as well as airlift capabilities, can
supply a high-readiness land combat company, and if
required, special operations forces into the region to
secure and stabilise the event.

35. Once a presence is established, New Zealand’s sealift,
sustainment and air transport capabilities will transport
equipment, stores, and rotating medium-readiness land
forces to support nations until stability is restored.

###### Support New Zealand’s presence in the Ross Dependency of Antarctica, and work with other agencies to monitor and respond to activity in  the Southern Ocean

36. New Zealand has strong ties to Antarctica. While
maintaining our claim in the region, New Zealand
supports the Antarctic Treaty System, including the use
of the region for peaceful purposes, and works to improve
scientific and environmental endeavours in the region.


37. The skills of the personnel of the Defence Force,
including field engineering, logistics management,
and the operation of ships and aircraft in challenging
environments, mean the Defence Force is ideally suited
to support New Zealand’s interests in the region. This is
achieved by undertaking non-military tasks to support
other Government agencies and the international
scientific community.

38. The New Zealand Defence Force’s airlift capabilities
provide the transportation of personnel and supplies to
the continent, including Defence personnel who repair
and replace infrastructure and maintain supply lines.

39. Fishing vessels and vessels in distress are able to
be monitored by air surveillance capabilities. Using
intelligence gained through surveillance, the naval
patrol force undertakes fisheries patrols on behalf of
the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine
Living Resources, and search and rescue activities in
support of New Zealand’s search and rescue obligations.

40. HMNZS Aotearoa will further support the civilian
presence on the continent, including scientific research,
through the provision of supplies on behalf of the Joint
Logistics Pool.

41. The delivery of a specialised Southern Ocean Patrol
Vessel will allow for fisheries patrols to monitor a greater
area of the Southern Ocean. With the ability to refuel at
sea from HMNZS Aotearoa, this vessel will also improve
the ability of the Defence Force to maintain fisheries
patrol throughout the fishing season.

###### Work with other agencies to monitor and understand New Zealand’s strategic environment

42. The activities outlined above demonstrate how Defence
Force capabilities regularly support other agencies in
New Zealand and the Pacific.

43. These activities provide significant intelligence regarding
our national and regional security. Specialist intelligence,
cyber and surveillance capabilities are maintained
to allow this intelligence to be analysed, informing
the strategic environment for Defence and other
New Zealand Government agencies.

44. Effective monitoring of the strategic environment allows
New Zealand to anticipate sudden changes, and to
observe and plan for long-term changes. The capabilities
required to achieve this outcome will be enhanced under
this Defence Capability Plan 2019.

45. New Zealand’s national security and interests also depend
on events further afield. It is important that New Zealand
can contribute Defence capabilities in support of
Asia-Pacific regional security. Similarly, New Zealand
must be able to contribute globally to support the
maintenance of the international rules-based order.


-----

##### World

###### Meet New Zealand’s commitments to its allies  and partners

46. Working with our partners, New Zealand maintains a
number of high-end combat-capable, flexible capabilities
that can be used in support of peace and security within
the region and the world.

47. Three core capabilities comprise New Zealand’s
high-end capabilities:

47.1 The decision in July 2018 to procure four
P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft means
New Zealand will retain a common strategic
air surveillance capability with key Defence
partners following the withdrawal from service
of the P-3 Orion fleet;

47.2 The naval combat capabilities provided by the
ANZAC frigates, and recently modernised through
the Frigate Systems Upgrade project to retain
world class combat systems and interoperability
with New Zealand’s key defence partners.
With HMNZS Aotearoa, the frigates will also
provide a global response option for long duration
operations; and

47.3 New Zealand’s Special Operation Force, providing
very high readiness counter-terrorism, special
reconnaissance, and combat capabilities.

48. Other Defence Force capabilities are able to provide
valuable contributions to operations with our partners.
This may be through the provision of niche capabilities
such as rapid environmental assessment to support
amphibious operations or the use of ports about which
little is known, or through contributions that supplement
partner forces.

49. As an integrated Defence Force, the contribution of
combat capabilities to our partners is reliant on support
capabilities. This includes the delivery of capabilities
into an area of operations through air or sealift, and
sustainment of the capability for the duration of the
operation.

50. The nature of these capabilities offers Government
a high level of discretion as to the size and nature of
New Zealand’s contributions to operations outside of
New Zealand’s immediate neighbourhood. Each is able
to be deployed individually, or as a joint task group,
towards coalition operations.

51. Maintaining these capabilities’ interoperability will ensure
they remain a valued contribution which will complement
our partners’ forces, while also strengthening
New Zealand’s force when it is operating independently.


###### Protect New Zealand’s wider interests by contributing to international peace and security and the international rules-based order

52. New Zealand’s contributions to the international rulesbased order usually comprise individual capabilities, or
small task groups of capabilities working as part of a
broader international effort.

53. Contributions towards the rules-based order will continue
to include a mix of capabilities:

53.1 International efforts to combat piracy,
transnational crime including the transhipment of
narcotics, and maritime security operations will
continue to be supported by naval combat and air
surveillance capabilities; and

53.2 United Nations peacekeeping operations and
capacity building missions will be primarily
supported by land forces, with a wide variety of
deployable capabilities available to offer value to
these operations.

54. Future contributions to the international rules-based order
will also require capabilities suitable for New Zealand’s
place within the digital world. Space and cyber capabilities,
described in this Defence Capability Plan 2019, will enable
New Zealand to expand its contribution in this area.

###### Make a credible contribution in support of peace and security in the Asia-Pacific region, including in support of regional security arrangements

55. The collective capabilities of the New Zealand Defence
Force offer Government a broad range of options for
contributions in support of peace and security in the
Asia-Pacific Region.

56. Choices on the size and nature of deployments will
ultimately depend on the event in question. This may require
immediate, short-term responses to events such as natural
disasters or conflict, or may involve long-term commitments.

# C h a p t e r 3

#### Delivering the Strategic Defence Policy Statement 2018 and Supporting the Pacific Reset


-----

57. The Strategic Defence Policy Statement 2018 anticipates
an increase in the frequency of responses the Defence
Force will be required to undertake in New Zealand’s
neighbourhood. Our ability to respond across this area,
which reaches from Antarctica to the South Pacific,
requires that we can monitor events and trends as they
unfold, and lead the responses to them.

58. This Plan responds to the requirements outlined in the
Policy Statement, by improving New Zealand’s overall
capacity to respond, and providing greater ability to
respond to multiple events concurrently.

59. Capabilities have been prioritised to provide the greatest
value to New Zealand, and New Zealand’s interests in
the Pacific. The capability needs identified in the Policy
Statement have been addressed, with investments
planned to improve our awareness of, and response to
what is occurring within our maritime domain, to develop
and maintain sophisticated cyber capabilities, and to
provide Defence contributions to the security of spacebased systems.

60. Recognising the value the Defence Force contributes to
the community and the nation through all-of-Government
objectives, this Plan also gives increased emphasis to
inter-agency cooperation.


##### Defence supporting the Pacific Reset

61. New Zealand is committed to long-term support to the
Pacific, which is based on understanding, friendship,
mutual benefit, collective ambition and sustainability.
This has been reinforced by the Coalition
Government’s Pacific Reset. Defence has an active
role to play in this, filling the need for capabilities with
which our Pacific partners are not equipped.

62. New Zealand is a Pacific nation through geography,
identity, and values. Our nation’s security and
wellbeing are intrinsically bound to the peace and
stability of the Pacific. Growing competition in the
region will challenge New Zealand and Australia’s
ability to maintain influence, protect our security, and
have a more positive impact in line with our values.

63. The Pacific Islands region is also disproportionately
affected by the impacts of climate change, at the same
time that it faces other intensifying complex disruptors,
such as transnational crime and resource competition.
Together, these challenges could test Pacific nations,
and will likely require increased levels of assistance,
including humanitarian and disaster response
operations.

64. The Strategic Defence Policy Statement 2018
increased the priority for the New Zealand Defence
Force to be able to operate in the Pacific to the
highest level, equal with New Zealand’s own territory,
our Exclusive Economic Zone, and the Southern
Ocean and Ross Dependency. This reflects the
importance of the Pacific to New Zealand’s national
security. New Zealand’s defence role in the Pacific
is non-discretionary, and the New Zealand Defence
Force already maintains a robust programme of
engagements across the region, which is being further
enhanced in the context of the Pacific Reset.

65. As the Strategic Defence Policy Statement 2018
recognises, the Defence Force will have to act in new
ways and at new levels to protect New Zealand’s
interests. The Defence Capability Plan 2019 delivers
the required lift in capability for New Zealand to support
the Pacific into the future. It provides for long-term,
sustainable efforts in the Pacific, as well as immediate
responses to potential shocks and fast-moving events
in the region.

66. New Zealand has unique strengths to draw from
when providing Defence support to the Pacific region.
Cooperation among Pacific Island nations will be most
successful when it leverages respective strengths
and coordinates complementary approaches to meet
Pacific security needs, in fostering a secure, stable and
resilient region.


-----

###### Increasing our capacity to respond

67. This Plan refocuses and improves Defence’s airlift
and sealift capabilities, to better support challenges
in the Pacific region. The demand placed on HMNZS
_Canterbury has highlighted the criticality of effective_
sealift. Experience over the last ten years has highlighted
the operational and environmental limits of HMNZS
_Canterbury, as well as the risks inherent in maintaining a_
sole vessel of this type. Similarly, the C-130H Hercules
are among the most Pacific orientated capabilities
of the Defence Force, and are crucial to transporting
New Zealand Defence Force people and equipment to
operations around the region, including areas of high risk,
or those which have limited accessibility for other aircraft.

68. The C-130H Hercules will be replaced within the next five
years, ensuring that this vital capability is maintained for
decades to come. The replacement of the C-130H will
provide for the full regeneration of existing Royal
New Zealand Air Force capabilities. Immediate, highreadiness responses in the Pacific, from humanitarian
and disaster relief to potential conflict or security
incidents, will require a flexible and versatile tactical airlift
capability. For this reason, replacement of the C-130H is
the highest priority for this plan.

69. Recognising the high value of sealift to humanitarian and
disaster relief, and the sustainment of deployed forces,
in the mid-2020s an additional sealift vessel will be
acquired. Operating alongside HMNZS Canterbury, this
acquisition will provide two sealift vessels, and will greatly
improve the effectiveness of the Defence Force, and the
resilience of the nation, and the region.

70. The enhanced sealift vessel will have greater lift capacity
than HMNZS Canterbury. The capability will provide a
highly flexible military asset, including hospital facilities,
planning spaces, and self-defence capabilities. It will
also provide support for the deployment of a range of
capabilities, including Special Forces, Unmanned Aerial
Vehicles and NH90 helicopters. The enhanced sealift
capability will also improve the New Zealand Defence
Force’s amphibious operations. Through the provision
of a well dock, it will be able to conduct operations in a
wider range of sea conditions, and will have the size and
capacity to carry large equipment, and sufficient aviation
capacity to allow extended, long duration operations. Its
size will also provide for the transport of a larger number
of personnel, allowing for the value of the increased size
of the New Zealand Army to be realised.


71. Collectively, these enhancements will significantly
increase our ability to respond to humanitarian and
security events in the Pacific region. While a future
project will determine detailed requirements for this
capability, a Landing Platform Dock is an example of
the type of vessel that will be considered.

72. Following 2030, HMNZS Canterbury will be withdrawn
from service. At this time an investment will be made to
further improve the Defence Force’s sealift capability with
an additional vessel. Options will be explored against the
composition of the fleet, the wider Defence Force and the
prevailing strategic environment.

###### Sustaining our presence in the community

73. People are the foundation from which the Defence Force
is able to support the community, both at home and in the
Pacific region. Defence people provide the connection
between the Defence Force and the communities to
which they belong. They represent our collective values
and cultures, our whakapapa and whānau, and are
New Zealand’s single greatest defence asset in the
South Pacific.

74. Defence Force people, operating from sea, air, and land,
provide security and stability, and relief from natural
disasters in the same way that they do throughout the
region and beyond.

75. Community-based support from Defence Force people
contributes to the building of resilience in ways ranging
from air and sea based search and rescue, response to
natural disasters, and support to conservation efforts.
The connection between Defence people and the
communities of New Zealand and our Pacific partners
is also deeply imbued in our national identity, providing
ceremony and solemnity to occasions of national
significance.

76. This Plan delivers foremost on these values and
connections by growing the Defence Force by a total
of approximately 1500 service personnel. To focus on
providing better and more sustainable services to the
nation and the Pacific, this will include increasing the size
of the New Zealand Army to 6000 personnel by 2035.


-----

##### Improving our maritime domain awareness and response

###### Enhanced air surveillance capabilities

77. New Zealand will face an increasing challenge in
coming years to identify, characterise and respond
to activity within its expansive maritime domain.
Addressing this challenge will ensure New Zealand
is better placed to protect our natural resources,
respond to irregular migration while protecting the
safety of those involved, and prevent the impacts of
transnational crime from reaching our nation.

78. The purchase of four Boeing P-8A Poseidon maritime
patrol aircraft, announced in July 2018, provides
a substantial commitment towards meeting this
challenge. The P-8A Poseidon will replace the six
P-3K2 Orion aircraft, which will be progressively
retired from 2023. This replacement will guarantee the
continuation of the maritime patrol function available to
the Government.

79. The P-8As provide a sophisticated, technologically
advanced military capability that is of value to
New Zealand and our partners. A commitment
will also be made for an enhanced air surveillance
capability, potentially utilising long range unmanned
aerial vehicles. This capability will be dedicated to
civil surveillance tasks, supporting the New Zealand
Police, Customs, Immigration, the Department of
Conservation, Maritime New Zealand and the Ministry
for Primary Industries.

80. This approach will provide greater availability of the
P-8A for high-end tasks in support of our defence
partners and the international rules-based order, while
also providing other agencies with readily available
surveillance capabilities that meet New Zealand’s
national requirements.


###### Preserving the Southern Ocean and New Zealand’s marine living resources

81. In the coming years it is likely that a range of factors will
lead to an increase in resource competition, impacting on
access to and sustainability of marine resources in
New Zealand, the Pacific, and the Southern Ocean.

82. An opportunity exists for New Zealand to better support
the sustainability of marine resources in the Southern
Ocean and in New Zealand’s Exclusive Economic Zone.
Monitoring and mitigating the effects of climate change
will also require continued support to New Zealand’s
civilian presence in Antarctica and the Southern Ocean.

83. Towards these ends this Defence Capability Plan 2019
includes the delivery of a dedicated Southern Ocean
Patrol Vessel. The capabilities of this vessel will be
primarily for use towards supporting other agencies in
the Southern Ocean and around New Zealand. Built to
commercial specifications, the vessel will have minimal
specialist military capabilities.

84. This vessel will be used by Defence alongside other
Government agencies in the Southern Ocean and
the waters of New Zealand, allowing the Otago Class
offshore patrol vessels, and their eventual replacements,
to focus on the South Pacific.

85. While the operation of this vessel will be Defence-led, it
will be able to support non-Defence functions including
the gathering of scientific data.


-----

##### Replacement of key capabilities

86. The Defence Capability Plan 2019 will see investment in
all the core capabilities that have provided the foundation
for New Zealand’s Defence Force for the last two
decades. These high-end capabilities offer significant
value to New Zealand’s security and our defence
relationships.

87. The Plan has been developed to ensure that each
capability is able to be sustained to provide the necessary
resources to our Defence personnel. Replacement of
capabilities have been planned in a manner that is both
financially and operationally achievable, to prevent
capability gaps while maintaining affordability.

###### Maintaining our high value air capabilities

88. The purchase of the P-8A will bring enhanced capability
to the roles performed by the P-3K2 Orions over many
decades such as contributing to the international rulesbased order through peace and security operations,
search and rescue, and as a contribution toward coalition
operations with our defence partners.

89. The P-8A will enable New Zealand to continue to
carry out a wide range of surveillance operations
independently, and when required, work effectively with
partners including Australia, the United Kingdom, and
the United States, who will all be operating the aircraft
at the time of delivery to New Zealand. Extending this
commitment to the Royal New Zealand Air Force’s fleet
of C-130H aircraft is the highest priority included in this
_Defence Capability Plan._


###### Extending the life of the ANZAC Frigates

90. The Government has already made a significant
investment in the ANZAC frigates, Te Mana and
_Te Kaha. These upgrades have been undertaken to_
ensure that the frigates remain world-class maritime
combat capabilities for the full duration of their service,
and include:

90.1 The maintenance of a discrete defensive close-in
weapons system on the frigates that provides a
final layer of protection against in-bound missile
and fast inshore attack craft threats;

90.2 A Platform Systems Upgrade, focused on the
replacement of propulsion diesel engines,
upgraded cooling systems, and new platform
management and integrated bridge systems;

90.3 The acquisition of the SH-2G(I) Seasprite
maritime helicopter, to provide an embarked
helicopter for the vessels that can provide rotary
wing surveillance, warfare and airlift; and

90.4 The Frigate Systems Upgrade, currently being
delivered, which will maintain the surveillance,
combat and self-defence capabilities of the
frigates. This includes replacement of the combat
management systems and a number of sensor
and weapon systems.

91. A further upgrade to the ships’ communications system
will ensure continued interoperability with our key Defence
partners. These upgrades will be completed in the early
2020s, at which point the ANZAC frigates will provide a
greater capability to the New Zealand Defence Force than
at any time since their introduction in the 1990s.

92. To realise the full value of these upgrades, the frigates’
expected service life will be extended past 2030. This
decision has been supported by independent analysis
of the vessels, which has demonstrated that they are
supportable for a greater period of time than
previously anticipated.

###### Replacing the maritime helicopter fleet

93. The maritime helicopter fleet provides a critical combat
element of the ANZAC frigates, while also increasing the
effectiveness of other naval capabilities when embarked
in patrol, sustainment and sealift ships.

94. To support the improved maritime capabilities in this plan,
the maritime helicopter fleet will be replaced by 2027,
preventing a capability gap arising from the end of service
life of the SH-2G(I) Seasprite.

# C h a p t e r 4

#### Responding to the Climate Crisis


-----

-----

# C h a p t e r 5

#### Improving our Ability  to Respond


-----

102. The Defence Capability Plan 2019 represents a
commitment to provide New Zealand with a Defence
Force that can deliver the outcomes required by the
_Strategic Defence Policy Statement 2018._

103. The Policy Statement identified various factors that will
influence New Zealand’s strategic environment over the
coming decade. As our strategic environment evolves, the
contributions of different capabilities towards the defence
and resilience of New Zealand’s communities and
interests can also be expected to change.

104. Capabilities that have been sufficient in past years will be
under increased pressure, challenging the ability of the
Defence Force to respond. Increasing extreme weather
events and transnational crime in the Pacific will require
greater involvement in the region. The Defence Force
will also need to retain the ability to contribute globally in
support of the international rules-based order.

##### A Force that can operate independently

105. Government’s highest priority for the Defence Force is its
ability to operate and undertake tasks in New Zealand’s
territory, including its Exclusive Economic Zone, and
its neighbourhood from the South Pacific through to
Antarctica. The Defence Force must be prepared to
operate independently, or lead combined operations, in
these areas if required.

106. Independent operations require a broad range of
capabilities that are able to operate as an integrated force
across all domains. These capabilities are required to
operate across the full spectrum of possible scenarios,
from humanitarian relief to those with a significant threat
level, including armed conflict.

107. Leading an operation or acting independently presents
a high level of complexity. It requires the delivery,
sustainment and support of personnel, equipment and
stores, potentially operating at great distances from
New Zealand. Each capability in this plan plays a part
in delivering this collective outcome.


##### Delivering other Defence priorities

108. Defence deployments beyond New Zealand’s immediate
region will most likely continue to be as part of operations
led by New Zealand’s security partners, or as part of
United Nations-mandated peace support operations.
The Defence Force must be able to operate effectively
with New Zealand’s key security partners, in particular
with our ally Australia.

109. In addition to providing an independent force, the
capabilities outlined in this Plan will provide Government
with options to meet all of the priorities of the Policy
Statement. This includes capabilities that offer wide
support to our partners, as well as several niche
capabilities required to address security challenges
unique to New Zealand.

110. Air, land and maritime capabilities will each provide
possible contributions in support of Asia-Pacific regional
security, towards United Nations mandated peacekeeping
operations, and as commitments in support of the
maintenance of the international rules-based order.

111. These same capabilities, along with cyber capabilities,
and a range of maritime surveillance capabilities, will
monitor New Zealand’s neighbourhood, and provide the
means for Defence to support other agencies to respond
to events in and around New Zealand.

112. In supporting collective outcomes, these capabilities may
be deployed individually, or collectively, as part of a wider
force. They include an array of capabilities that can act
in combat or support roles. This ensures a high level of
discretion as to the size and nature of New Zealand’s
contributions to such operations outside New Zealand’s
immediate neighbourhood.

##### How the Defence Force will undertake its principal roles

113. All force elements must be organised, trained and
supported to allow for four potential ways of operating:

113.1 As independent elements;

113.2 As a Joint Task Force to provide an independent
response option;

113.3 As a military contribution to a broader
New Zealand response; and

113.4 As a New Zealand contribution to coalition
operations.

114. The nature of operations and the maintenance of
capability can be considered within three distinct types of
operations:

114.1 Current Military Operations, involving the
employment of New Zealand’s armed forces


-----

114.2 Standing Commitments, ongoing services
provided by Defence domestically. These often
incorporate the delivery of services to other
Government agencies. Standing commitments
reflect the role of the Defence Force in protecting
New Zealand’s sovereignty and community
wellbeing; and

114.3 Contingent capabilities, maintained in order to
deploy in response to national risks or sudden
changes to the strategic environment, contingent
capabilities relate to Defence’s role in managing
the risk to New Zealand’s wellbeing.

###### Prepared to respond to sudden shifts in the strategic environment

115. Defence is often required to respond to events that cannot
be anticipated, and which require an immediate and
significant response.

116. To achieve this, contingent capabilities require forces to
be kept at agreed levels of readiness:

116.1 Very High Readiness forces enable rapid
response to events in the South Pacific, and to
natural disasters; and

116.2 Medium Readiness forces provide the means
to sustain large-scale deployments, including
preparing follow on forces and the regeneration of
forces following deployments.

##### A more resilient Defence Force

117. Defence must be able to respond to incidents that arise
concurrently. Capabilities that provide a wide range
of response options have therefore been prioritised
for investment. Where capabilities are currently under
pressure to provide sufficient capacity, options have
been assessed to determine where their roles can be
complemented.

118. Over past decades, the Defence Force has been reliant
on a number of capabilities based on either a single or
very small number of platforms, including:

118.1 HMNZS Canterbury – the single sealift
vessel of the New Zealand Defence Force is
essential to large scale and timely responses
in the Pacific region, particularly during cyclone
season. However, the ship is also a critical
component of any response to domestic civil
defence management, and acts as a deployed
headquarters for military operations;

118.2 Offshore Patrol Vessels – the coincidence of the
summer fishing season in the Southern Ocean,
and the cyclone season in the Pacific creates
demands on the two Offshore Patrol Vessels that
often exceed the capacity of a two ship fleet; and


118.3 Land Forces – the ongoing deployment of land
forces requires training and respite for those
being deployed, as well as significant support
structures working domestically to enable the
deployment. Existing personnel numbers in
the New Zealand Army impose a limit of one
large-scale deployment at any one time, despite
the diversity of roles our land forces play in the
community, nation and world.

119. In addition to this, the need for certain capabilities to cover
a wide range of roles reduces their overall availability. This
can be illustrated by existing air surveillance capabilities
provided by the P-3K2 Orion, which are required to
concurrently support domestic air surveillance, search and
rescue operations, and international partnerships, such as
counter-piracy missions.

120. The changes outlined in Chapter Three will significantly
enhance Defence’s capacity for concurrent operations
with additional sealift, patrol, and people. Furthermore,
improved aerial surveillance with a greater diversity of
response options will improve the efficiency with which
capabilities are deployed.

##### Concurrency

121. With the changes described in Chapter Three, the force
outlined in this Defence Capability Plan 2019 provides
sufficient capabilities to ensure Defence is able to deliver
its standing commitments, including domestic and
Southern Ocean operations, while also delivering one of
the following:

121.1 Contribute a single independent Joint Task
Force to a high-risk operation in the South
Pacific, including land, air, maritime and support
capabilities;

121.2 Respond to a low threat security event or provide
humanitarian assistance and disaster relief within
the South Pacific, while also contributing a small
number of capabilities to coalition operations
globally; and

121.3 Contribute multiple capabilities, individually or
collectively, to a range of short duration operations
globally.

122. In practice, the operations being undertaken at a given
time will be dependent on the needs of New Zealand and
the Pacific region, the nature of the events requiring a
response, and the decisions of Government as to the type
of response provided.


-----

# C h a p t e r 6

#### Positioning our Defence  Force for the Future


-----

123. Flexibility and adaptability will remain key attributes of the
capabilities delivered under this Capability Plan. To deliver
a force that meets the principles of the Strategic Defence
_Policy Statement 2018, an increasing range of modern_
technologies and resources will be introduced to the
New Zealand Defence Force.

124. The speed and effectiveness with which the Defence
Force is able to respond to events is dependent on
its ability to collect, analyse, distribute and exploit the
immense quantities of information generated by modern
information technologies. The effectiveness of all
defence capabilities are now dependent on information
capabilities. Major investments included in this plan
will be unable to provide their full benefits without the
corresponding investment in information technologies.

125. Information domain capabilities are critical to Defence
Force interoperability and support our defence
partnership. The ability to protect, exchange and exploit
information to an agreed common standard forms an
essential part in our ability to operate with partners,
including Australia.

126. This chapter outlines how non-traditional and enabling
capabilities will be adapted to provide for the Defence
Force and New Zealand into the future.

127. Delivering the information capabilities described in this
plan will require Defence to work with other Government
agencies. The challenges of keeping pace with
technological change and maintaining an appropriately
skilled workforce, while also ensuring that agencies retain
complementary levels of capability to allow them to work
together, will require an all-of-Government solution within
the Information Domain.

128. Investments in these capabilities will be informed over
the course of delivering the Plan through continued
cross agency development on delivery options. This
will determine how best to integrate these capabilities
into the existing structure of New Zealand’s national
security system. Consideration will be given to sharing
responsibilities and resources between agencies, and will
include consideration of the following capabilities.


##### Technologies for the modern era

###### Space-centred capabilities

129. Space is of high and growing strategic importance
globally, with space-based systems becoming
increasingly relied on for communication, commerce,
navigation and transport, the management of
infrastructure, and the observation of weather movements
and human activity. The influence of these systems
in everyday life is inescapable, supporting community
growth, national prosperity and connectedness, as well
as both enhancing and challenging national security
objectives.

130. This reliance extends to military capabilities. Spacebased systems are essential for communications,
information exchange and navigation. They are a
prerequisite to maintaining a professional, combatcapable and flexible force.

131. New Zealand is now amongst a small number of nations
hosting space launches, and has an associated obligation
to support international rules and norms regarding the use
of space. Furthermore, New Zealand’s relative geographic
isolation increases the benefits derived from space-based
infrastructure.

132. This Plan will deliver satellite surveillance systems,
drawing from improved space-based technologies to
provide maritime domain awareness to an extent that
cannot be achieved through traditional means. This will
allow for a greater level of risk identification and more
directed utilisation of resources.

133. The specific role of the New Zealand Defence Force in
delivering these capabilities will be confirmed during the
investment case process. However this role will include
the utilisation of space-based systems both to achieve
military effects, and also to support all-of-Government
outcomes within our Exclusive Economic Zone, our
neighbourhood, and the Southern Ocean.


-----

###### Enhanced cyber capabilities

134. To maintain relevant combat capabilities, including
interoperability with close partners, the Defence Force
needs to be able to conduct a range of cyber operations.

135. In keeping with the commitment made under previous
Capability Plans, the New Zealand Defence Force
will deliver defensive cyber capabilities, to keep pace
with the evolving threat to information security. This
capability will ensure we remain a credible and trusted
partner, and protect information that is central to our
national security.

136. Additionally, cyber capabilities will now be developed
to include deployable teams capable of generating a
range of military effects. These capabilities will offer
greater force protection, reduce risks to personnel, and
enable military objectives to be met through a greater
range of approaches.

137. This cyber capability will have highly trained, professional
personnel at its core. The Defence Force will expand on
the cyber capability committed under the Defence White
_Paper 2016, and progressively build on this capability_
over the timelines of this Plan.

138. Protection of information and interoperability will
also drive the requirement for the upgrade of several
communications systems. These upgrades will ensure
that existing capabilities keep pace with advancing
technological trends in encrypted and high bandwidth
communication systems.

139. Where appropriate, new capabilities will be purchased
with plans in place for progressive, spiral upgrades,
eliminating capability degradation over time and the need
for single, high cost upgrades during their service lives.


###### Long endurance unmanned aerial systems

140. The provision of continuous, real time information is a key
determinant in the effectiveness of military operations.
Unmanned aerial systems provide a means for
commanders to maintain and sustain awareness of their
operating environment. This plan includes the delivery of
long endurance unmanned aerial systems for intelligence,
surveillance and reconnaissance tasks to support land
and maritime military forces.

141. Manned aircraft will remain New Zealand’s primary air
capabilities in the foreseeable future. However, some
operations may see it preferable to use unmanned aircraft
over crewed aircraft; these include the ability to maintain
sustained surveillance over long missions, provide a
range of mission support roles to deployed forces, and
reduce the risk to personnel in high risk situations.

###### An information led Defence Force

142. The introduction of space-based capabilities, the P-8A
Poseidon, upgrades to the ANZAC frigates, improved
cyber capabilities and complementary air surveillance
capabilities will result in an unprecedented collection of
data. This presents a significant opportunity to improve
the effectiveness and value of New Zealand’s Defence
Force, and the overall achievement of New Zealand’s
wider national security objectives.

143. The Defence Force’s capacity to process, analyse
and distribute information needs to be enhanced
to match the greater levels of data now able to be
gathered from upgraded intelligence, surveillance
and reconnaissance platforms.

144. This includes the technologies used to process, share
and protect information that enables the Defence Force
to understand, plan, control, coordinate and effectively
direct operations. Current capabilities will benefit greatly
from increased investment in intelligence and a more
systematic approach across the Defence Force and the
national security system more broadly.

145. Improvements in these areas will improve awareness
of our Exclusive Economic Zone, support operations
overseas by providing actionable intelligence to military
commanders, and enable Defence to share actionable
information with other agencies.

146. An improved intelligence capability will also enable more
efficient decision making by commanders. For example,
real time analysis of intelligence collected through spacebased systems will allow for targeted use of naval vessels,
which will be able to be directed to intercept, board and
inspect vessels of interest in support of partners and other
agencies.

# C h a p t e r 7

#### Toward a Sustainable Future


-----

147. The investment intentions included in this plan are
substantial. It is therefore important that Defence
spending is approached in a way that ensures that
capability can be sustained over time. Recognising that
Defence is but one part of the Coalition Government’s
goal of improving, sustaining and protecting
intergenerational wellbeing, this Plan seeks to balance
cost, viability of delivery and operational needs.

148. The Defence Capability Plan 2019 extends the planning
horizon for Defence, while maintaining the planned level
of capital investment out to 2030. Maintaining this level
of funding has been achieved alongside planning for
new capabilities not provided for by previous Defence
_Capability Plans. Indicative capabilities that will ensure the_
Defence Force is prepared for the strategic environment
following 2030 have also been identified, and will be
explored in depth in the Defence White Paper planned
for 2022. These capabilities and the value they offer are
outlined in the following chapters.

149. Learning from recent challenges, replacements for major
Defence capabilities have been planned in a staggered
approach, allowing for funding and resources to be
utilised consistently and efficiently. Similarly, increases in
the Defence Force’s work force and asset management
processes as capabilities are delivered are being planned
to ensure a long-term sustainable approach.

##### Rationalised, efficient services

###### Modernised logistics

150. Defence is seeking to enhance and rationalise
the management of its asset base through the
Consolidated Logistics Project that is now in delivery.
The Project delivers business change that will provide
the logistic organisations necessary for the Defence
Force to deliver required military output in a more
flexible, adaptable and efficient manner.

151. The core principle of the Consolidated Logistics Project is
‘equip the force’. This principle will see the management
and holding of equipment rationalised and regionally
managed, moving away from unit level resourcing.
Through the application of the ‘equip the force’ principle,
the Consolidated Logistics Project will enable significant
cost savings over the period of this Plan.

152. Equipping the force will be achieved through four key work
streams that will deliver a refreshed logistics organisation,
improved information management and analytics, and
the development of regional logistic pools including the
provision of enhanced regional infrastructure. Anticipated
benefits include:

152.1 Improved equipment accessibility, utilisation
and availability;

152.2 Improved ability to undertake logistic activities
and training;

152.3 Contribution to improved equipment safety
assurance;

152.4 Improved strategic equipment and material
management; and


###### Intelligent delivery for information and communication technology

153. Recognising the increasingly central role information
and communication technologies play in the delivery of
Defence outcomes, the Defence Force has embarked on
the Communications and Information Systems Change
and Transformation Project.

154. The project will deliver a tailored organisational IT model
to the Defence Force. Through innovative solutions, this
will provide increased capacity and capability, improved
integration of technologies, and greater oversight of
initiatives to ensure rationalised and fully considered
investment. Taken together, these changes will result in
a significant reduction in organisational risk.

155. Working in partnership with commercial providers,
the Defence Force will look to introduce secure cloudbased information management, simplified support
arrangements, and a more sustainable and efficient
information and communication model.

##### Sustainable, long-term  workforce planning

156. Maintaining and growing a force of highly trained
professionals requires careful long-term planning.
Without the external resource pools or training providers
available to other agencies, investment in the skills
needed for military operations necessitates developing
individuals within the force over time. Delivering
improved capabilities out to 2030 requires the military
workforce to start preparing for growth and development
of personnel now.

157. The Defence Force and Ministry of Defence, in
consultation with the Central Agencies, are undertaking
work focused on the Defence Force’s workforce
structure, with the aim of providing assurance on longterm cost pressures, and improving the sustainability of
the Defence Force’s operating costs. This has included
the development of a model that will deliver improved
accuracy and identify where changes in management
practice, or internal policy could improve performance.

158. The implementation of this model will provide the
personnel required for the continued operation of the
capabilities outlined in this plan. It will also provide for the
necessary support such capabilities require, growing a
professional Defence Force to serve New Zealand.

#### Equipping the Defence Force:  Planned Investments in Capability


-----

159. This chapter outlines the intended capital investments
planned by Government to achieve the objectives of this
plan, and the Strategic Defence Policy Statement 2018.
These investment intentions maintain the $20 billion in
investment in the New Zealand Defence Force out to 2030.

160. Investment intentions are categorised within their respective
domains, and are ordered according to the year in which the
Government expects to make a decision on the eventual
capability solution.

161. The timing and description of capability investments provided
here are indicative. Options for each intended investment
will be tested as broadly as possible against policy, including
different models of delivery where appropriate.

162. Investment intentions out to 2030 are subject to individual
business cases justifying the investment, and funding
being available through the Budget process, taking into
account other Government priorities. Indicative investments
planned for commitment between 2030 and 2035 have
been included to allow for considered, long-term planning
for the Defence Force’s future needs. These capabilities
will be reassessed ahead of the 2022 Defence White
Paper. Detailed assessment at this time will allow for
a greater appreciation of improvement to military and
commercial technologies, as well as the requirements of
New Zealand in the prevailing strategic environment at that
time. A greater understanding of these factors will allow for
indicative dates and costs to be provided.

##### Gaining approval on the investments outlined in this plan

163. Business cases for major capability projects are built
progressively, and follow a three pass approval process
to Cabinet:

163.1 Indicative Business Case – tests whether there
is an acceptable level of benefit from a proposed
investment, the likely costs, and provides a range of
options that could deliver the benefits required;

163.2 Detailed Business Case – examines thoroughly
one or more of the options agreed in the Indicative
Business Case, and assembles the information that
would allow Cabinet to make an informed decision
on whether to progress the proposal to the point
of inviting tenders or other competitive market
proposals; and

163.3 Implementation Business Case – reports on the
outcome of a tender or other supplier selection
process, the total costs of the proposal and seeks
Cabinet approval to commit to the investment.


164. Indicative timings for decisions on Implementation
Business Cases have been included in this plan for
major capability projects, for public transparency and to
give industry greater awareness of when information will
be sought.

165. The process of working towards an implementation
business cases can take between two and
five years depending on the scale and complexity
of the investment.

##### Early engagement

166. A business case approach encourages early
engagement, including with industry, to confirm:

166.1 The fit with strategy, and the need to invest;

166.2 That all options are considered, including different
models of delivery where appropriate; and

166.3 That preferred options are affordable and
deliverable.

167. Industry days and other opportunities for direct
engagement will be held in support of requests for
information and tenders, which will be undertaken
through the business case project.

168. Indicative Business Cases are normally informed by a
Request for Information from Industry. These requests
will seek information on the range of options that could
deliver benefits, along with indicative capital and wholeof-life costs.

169. A second, more targeted Request for Information may be

#### Planned Investments in Air Capabilities


-----

172. The primary focus for investments in Defence capabilities
will be the replacement of the air surveillance and air
transport fleets. These fleets are among the highest
value capabilities to New Zealand, with the movement of
personnel and equipment, both regionally and globally,
being reliant on air assets. For many of the roles of the
New Zealand Defence Force, it is these aircraft that allow
for a high-readiness first response.

173. Following the replacement of the air transport aircraft,
the Royal New Zealand Air Force will have replaced
the majority of its capabilities with effective, proven,
modern aircraft. The focus for investments will then be
on delivering greater effectiveness to all-of-Government
objectives, including through the enhanced maritime
awareness capability.

174. Investments are subject to Cabinet approval of individual
business cases justifying the investment, and funding
being available through the budget process, taking into
account other government priorities.

##### Investment decisions planned for 2020

###### Future Tactical Air Mobility

175. Preserving the tactical airlift capability of the
New Zealand Defence Force is the highest priority of
the Defence Capability Plan 2019. A Future Air Mobility
Capability project has confirmed Defence’s requirements
for a tactical airlift capability to replace the existing C-130H
Hercules. The five existing Hercules will be replaced with
modern aircraft.

176. The capability will be able to move personnel and cargo
within the South Pacific, to Antarctica, and in support of

#### Planned Investments in Maritime Capabilities


-----

184. In the ten years between 2012 and 2022, the Royal
New Zealand Navy will have decommissioned three
vessels, and will have introduced the new fleet tanker
HMNZS Aotearoa, the dive and hydrographic vessel
HMNZS Manawanui, and the refurbished Anzac class
frigates. Each of these new capabilities will be world class,
providing a strong foundation for the Navy out to 2030.

185. Focus for maritime investments will move to the patrol
and sealift forces, with each vessel requiring replacement
within the timeframe of this Capability Plan. These ships
have made significant contributions domestically and in
the South Pacific. Moving to more specialised vessels,
including enhanced sealift and an ice-strengthened patrol
vessel, will provide the Defence Force with the capability
needed to meet future challenges.

186. Investments are subject to Cabinet approval of individual
business cases justifying the investment, and funding
being available through the budget process, taking into
account other government priorities.

##### Investment decisions planned for 2020

###### Patrol and Sealift Communication Upgrades

187. By 2022, upgrades to communications systems onboard HMNZS Canterbury, HMNZS Otago and HMNZS
_Wellington will be complete. These upgrades will enable_
the ships to operate to the full extent of their capabilities
until the end of their service lives.

188. Upgraded communications will allow the HMNZS
_Canterbury to act as a base for deployed amphibious_
operations, address obsolescence, and will provide
sufficient capacity to simultaneously communicate with
maritime, air and land forces.

189. Upgraded communications on the offshore patrol vessels
will address obsolescence, and support interoperability
with partners and recently acquired capabilities.

**Indicative dates:**
Industry engagement commences – Currently underway
Request for tender – 2019
Introduction into Service – 2022

**Indicative capital cost:**

##### Investment decisions planned for 2021

###### ANZAC Frigate Life Extension

190. The major upgrades currently being undertaken on
the ANZAC frigates combat systems will not be fully
completed until 2023. In order to maximise the value
of these upgrades, the service lives of the ANZAC
frigates will be extended until after 2030. To support this
life extension additional work will be completed on the
vessels, including an enhanced maintenance and repair
package to ensure appropriate upkeep until the end of the
ships’ service lives.

191. Delaying the replacement of the frigates improves the
affordability of the Defence Capability Plan 2019 by
de-conflicting the replacement of the most significant
Defence capabilities.

###### ANZAC Communication Upgrade

193. The Navy’s existing patrol capabilities are not able to meet
the changing requirements of New Zealand’s maritime
domain. The inshore and offshore patrol vessel have
provided significant value during their service lives, but
are increasingly operationally limited as the ships age
and regulations evolve. With expectations to operate
with increasing frequency in the South Pacific and the
Southern Ocean, the existing vessels do not provide the
optimal fleet for our maritime domain.

194. Acquisition of a Southern Ocean Patrol Vessel will occur
in the mid-2020s. The new vessel will provide dedicated
patrol capabilities to other Government agencies within
New Zealand’s sovereign waters and the Southern
Ocean. Built to commercial standards, the vessel will
significantly increase the level of capability and safety for
operations in the Southern Ocean, allowing for a broader
patrol area and the ability to stay within fishing grounds for
greater durations. This will allow the remaining offshore
patrol vessels greater capacity to respond in the Pacific.

and scientific expertise. Inclusion of universities where
suitable, can provide added access to scientific expertise
and innovation in future-proofing Defence capability
solutions.

245. The values and behaviours underpinning Defence’s
partnership with industry are set out in two key
documents: the Defence Engagement Strategy, Smart
Customers and Smart Suppliers, and the New Zealand
_Defence Force Framework for External and Industry_
_Engagement. Both documents put a priority on_
setting expectations early, getting the right two-way
communications, fostering early engagement, respecting
each other’s culture, and understanding the constraints
that each party operates under.

246. These behaviours support a robust Capability
Management System that will deliver goods and services
that are modern, relevant, proven and reliable. The
Ministry of Defence and the New Zealand Defence
Force currently work with both national and international
companies so that the Defence Force can deliver value
to the community, nation and world. Maintaining and
enhancing the commitment, understanding and trust
between Defence and industry will ensure this continues
into the future.


##### Driving concepts

247. Defence industry has access to commercial and industrial
information, the infrastructure and personnel to contribute
effectively and to inform Defence procurement options.

248. As a source of commercial knowledge and engineering
and scientific expertise, Defence industry works with
Defence to reduce project risk and improve system
performance.

249. Defence engages and partners with capable suppliers
with the capacity to support the achievement of
Defence outputs and outcomes and deliver value to the
community, nation and world.

250. Value for money is enhanced when international prime
suppliers partner with New Zealand-based companies
and, when relevant, local scientific and tertiary institutions
when delivering and supporting military capability.

251. Improvements in Defence processes for early
engagement will harness innovation in supplying products
and services, as well as reducing risk.

252. Effective partnerships with industry are developed to
support the full capability life-cycle that contributes directly
or indirectly to the delivery of Defence outputs and
outcomes.

##### Industry engagement

###### Early engagement

253. The review of Defence’s procurement, completed in
May 2018, identified an area of opportunity for greater
engagement with industry. This area is in the capability
definition phase of the project life-cycle between project
initiation and formally approaching the market with a
Request for Tenders.

254. Defence-led projects initiated under this capability
plan will be required to have at least two structured
engagements with the market during this early phase and
prior to releasing a Request for Tenders. The aim is to
engage industry to reduce risk and uncertainty in capital
procurements and to ensure Defence understands and
can leverage the market.

255. Engaging early with industry will mean fewer surprises
and better quality solutions. It will allow the Government to
make informed investment decisions, based on the best
information available as early in the process as possible.

###### Transparency and ease of business

256. Defence will ensure that industry is as informed as
possible on plans for future defence spending. This
includes provisional estimates of cost and schedule
for Defence-led and infrastructure projects, along with
indicative dates for engaging with industry.

257. Defence will work to ensure that the tender debrief
process is robust, informed and adds value to suppliers.
Defence has also developed tools and information portals
to enable industry to keep up to date with developments
within Defence and industry. Started in 2016, an annual
customer survey measures industry satisfaction with their
engagements with Defence. The findings are published,
along with the steps taken by Defence in responding to
industry feedback and suggestions for improvement.

258. Defence will continue to work on improving the Defence
procurement and acquisition processes. This includes
clarity of documentation, to reduce workload for industry
responding to Requests for Information and Tenders.

###### A focus on New Zealand industry

259. The Government’s expectation that the Defence Force
is flexible and is held at high levels of readiness means
that value for money is enhanced when New Zealandbased suppliers are engaged in the supply and support of
military capability.

260. International prime companies submitting proposals to
provide the capabilities outlined in this capability plan will
be required to provide activity reports setting out the steps
they have taken to identify and use New Zealand industry
to supply goods and services as part of their proposal.
Activity reports will specify the names and addresses of
the New Zealand companies approached, describe the
goods and services to be supplied over the life of the
proposed contract, and quantify the value of those goods
and services.

261. Defence will use this information when considering
whether the proposal provides best value for money over
the life of the contracts, including taking into account
any savings in time, money and labour, and enhanced
responsiveness or resilience.


###### System integration

262. The unprecedented influx of data delivered by the
investment priorities detailed in this capability plan
will need to be processed and shared across multiple
platforms and units, ranging from ships to individual
soldiers on the ground. The aim is for every ship, aircraft,
vehicle and soldier to be connected and able to share
meaningful information.

263. The complex and ‘system of systems’ nature of modern
Defence projects represents a considerable challenge,
particularly in the Land Domain. For industry, this
represents an opportunity to help Defence understand
and address the gaps in its technical and managerial
capability to oversee systems integration, and ensure
that the overall capability delivers what Defence needs, is
robust, and is sustainable over time.

264. For suppliers of equipment it also means considering how
the various sub-systems can be integrated into the wider
Defence Force architecture with the least risk and the
least burden on the end-user.

##### New Zealand Defence Industry Advisory Council, Minister of  Defence Awards

265. The interests of Defence and Industry are represented
by the New Zealand Defence Industry Advisory Council
and the New Zealand Defence Industry Association.
The New Zealand Defence Industry Advisory Council
is appointed by, and reports directly to, the Minister of
Defence. It has a wide brief to provide advice relating to
developments, issues, and opportunities in the national
and international defence industry sectors.

266. The New Zealand Defence Industry Association is the
preeminent body representing the commercial interests
of Defence industry and its individual members. It is
industry’s main conduit into Defence and vice versa.

267. Defence will continue to coordinate the New Zealand
Defence Industry Advisory Council and support the
New Zealand Defence Industry Association. This
includes continued support of the annual Minister of
Defence Awards of Excellence to Industry and Defence
Industry Association meetings and forums. Given
the level of investment forecast in this capability plan
activities where Defence can engage with industry,
build relationships, and recognise excellence in
capability service delivery are vital.
