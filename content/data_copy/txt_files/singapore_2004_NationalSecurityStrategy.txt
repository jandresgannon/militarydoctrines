SIX [NATIONAL SECURITY: A NATIONAL EFFORT]

###### Dear Fellow Singaporeans,

 ransnational terrorism poses a serious and prolonged threat to Singapore’s
## T
###### national security. Because of the strong stand we have taken against terrorism in Singapore and in the region, and because of the part we have played in the global effort against terrorism, Singapore will remain a prime target for terrorists. Therefore, we have to prepare for a long- drawn campaign against terrorism, and we need to learn to live with the real prospect that a terrorist attack could occur in this country.

_Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam_
_Deputy Prime Minister_ We have met the short-term objective of hardening
_Coordinating Minister for Security and Defence_
Singapore by implementing various measures to
safeguard our homefront security. However, we are
not dealing with isolated or episodic events, but with
the potential for organized, deliberate and prolonged
terrorist action against Singapore. We thus need a total
approach to the problem, as the impact of terrorism
will be felt across many areas. We have to find creative
solutions for these unprecedented challenges.


-----

Given our geo-strategic circumstances and the evolving
nature of transnational terrorism, we should take an
evolutionary approach to developing our national
security strategy. The Fight Against Terror: Singapore’s
_National Security Strategy lays out a useful foundation._
We now have a better understanding of the threat and
of how we can counter it. The key ideas behind this
strategy should be disseminated widely to create
awareness and enlist support.

We need to get our starting point right, and it entails a
correct understanding of the problems and threats that
Singapore is up against. In this regard, we must have a
consensus on the definition and characteristics of
transnational terrorism. The threat is strategic. It is
different from the terrorism we experienced in the
past. Transnational terrorism is not a passing menace.
It is a long-term peril. It has deep ideological roots. It
has a global reach, and terrorists are prepared to go to
extreme lengths to realize their aims. Terrorist groups
are also capable of strategic calculations. A case in
point is the recent train bombings in Madrid, where a
tragic incident led to domestic political changes with
foreign policy implications.

We must develop the appropriate strategy to combat
transnational terrorism. The cornerstone of
Singapore’s strategy is a stronger and more robust


inter-agency network. Given that transnational
terrorism’s centre of gravity lies outside Singapore, a
stove-piped approach to internal security and external
defence will no longer work. We need to implement a
suitable structure that will prevail over the traditional
boundaries of the various policy, intelligence and
operations agencies. At its core, our national security
strategy should aim to enhance coordination among
the different ministries and national security agencies
in Singapore.

We need, furthermore, to strengthen our national
resilience. We have to encourage Singaporeans to stay
calm and work together in the face of adversity. We
need to take both collective action and individual
responsibility for our security. We have committed
ourselves to the global campaign against terrorism. In
this, we must not waiver. We may face setbacks, but
terrorism cannot defeat us unless we allow it to. I am
confident Singaporeans will rise to the challenge.

SIX [NATIONAL SECURITY: A NATIONAL EFFORT]


###### f there is any doubt as to the intent of terrorists today, we need only recollect
## I
###### the events of September 11, 2001. The attacks against the United States claimed the lives of nearly 3,000 people from some 85 countries, underscoring the catastrophic nature of militant transnational terrorism. Closer to home, developments such as the Bali bombings in October 2002 which killed 202 people showed that South-east Asia is also vulnerable to attacks.

Singapore is high on the list of targets for terrorist
action. It is important that we recognize this stark
reality. The extremist regional network Jemaah
Islamiyah (JI), which is intent on subverting
governments in the region, has targeted us before.
Those plots were foiled, but we can anticipate that
there will be more attempts to attack us. Besides JI, we
may face action from other extremist groups as well.
Worldwide, Al-Qaeda elements remain active, planning
future action against American and other interests.


We are not alone in the struggle against terrorism.
Yet, we must realize that we are ultimately
responsible for our own security. Terrorism is
certainly not new to Singapore. It can be understood
as the mounting of tactical operations aimed at
achieving certain political goals. In terrorism,
relatively little effort may be required to produce
devastating results. It capitalizes on the element of
surprise, but works over long time frames. Even if
disrupted, terror organizations may regenerate
themselves, and wait years before pursuing their
objectives again.

_Osama bin Laden, leader of_
_the Al-Qaeda global terror_
_network._


-----

What is new in what we are facing, however, is the
lethal combination of several especially extreme
factors. The current trend of transnational terrorism is
strategic in nature. It demonstrates a clear global
reach, employs particularly sophisticated methods, and
exhibits catastrophic outcomes. In particular, the AlQaeda-inspired movement also springs from a radical
and dangerous ideology based upon distortions of
Islam, devoid of any moral restraint. What we are
witnessing currently is, in essence, an immense
contest between those who seek peace and security
and a ruthless fanaticism that must have no place in
the modern world.

Singapore is part of this fight. We cannot simply opt
out of it. We have to prepare for it, and meet it head
on. To do this, we need new policies, structures and
capabilities. What is our goal? There is no silver bullet
available. Our goal is to minimize the country’s
vulnerability by deploying the strongest possible
defences against terror attacks. We cannot guard every
installation or scan every visitor. What we can do is
reduce the threat to a tolerable level, so that terrorism
does not have a significant impact on our society and
economy.


to fortify Singapore by implementing a number of
measures to safeguard our homefront.

We have raised Singapore’s security standards in
crucial areas such as aviation security, maritime
security, land transport security, border control, and
critical infrastructure protection.

In the past three years, we have also introduced new
structures and enhanced existing organizations in the
policy, intelligence and operations domains. For
instance, we formed new agencies such as the
Homefront Security Office and the Joint Counter
Terrorism Centre, while also reinvigorating existing
units such as the National Security Secretariat, to give a
stronger focus to inter-agency coordination and
integration. Together, these agencies have contributed
greatly to anticipating threats, and in organizing and
building up Singapore’s defences against terrorism.


###### WHY DO WE NEED A NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY?

carry out high-profile and complex terrorist attacks,
they would still be capable of mounting small-scale
attacks against targets in Singapore and beyond.

Terrorism will be with us for many years to come. “It
will be a long war for Singapore and the region, and
the end is not yet in sight,” Deputy Prime Minister Lee
Hsien Loong has cautioned. Singapore will continue to
be vulnerable because of the very strong stand we have
taken against terrorism, the arrests we have made to
crack down on JI in Singapore, the assistance we have
extended to regional efforts against terrorist groups,
and the support we have given to the American
reconstruction actions in Afghanistan and Iraq. We
must thus expect that if the opportunity presents
itself, terrorists will launch an attack on the island
or against Singapore assets and interests overseas.


In dealing with such terrorism, we must develop a
sustainable, long-term national security strategy and a
coherent strategic framework. To do so, we have to
continue to evolve beyond our traditional boundaries
and established national security structures.

We need a total approach to the problem, as the
impact of terrorism will be felt in many areas,
affecting Singapore’s foreign, defence, homefront,
social and economic policies. If we do not
continually shape our collective responses, the
solutions that emerge may not be sufficiently
comprehensive. We need a disciplined and deliberate
strategy to anticipate the threat, to understand it, and
to devise a response. It will focus our minds and
sustain our efforts, even when the threat is not
immediately apparent.


-----

###### WHY DO WE NEED THIS DOCUMENT?


_The Fight Against Terror: Singapore’s National_
_Security Strategy outlines the nature of the threat that_
confronts Singapore today, briefly explains Singapore’s
security priorities, and describes the strategy we will
adopt to counter terrorism. It seeks to provide all
Singaporeans with a sense of where we are now,
where we must go and what we must do in this
security landscape. It is a common compass and
roadmap for all stakeholders in national security.

Singapore’s national security strategy aims, principally,
to prevent threats to national security from developing
in the first instance; protect Singapore against the
more likely threats; respond to such threats if
prevention and protection should fail; and achieve a
quick recovery to return Singapore to a state of
normalcy.


How will we do this? We will build up the critical
expertise and competencies required to confront
these challenges. We will strengthen existing agencies,
and establish new ones, if necessary, to best meet the
demands of national security.

We intend to achieve these aims through tighter
networking and inter-agency coordination. This is the
key tenet and cornerstone of our national security
strategy. We need to build strong and durable bridges
for a more robust national security network.
Terrorism is a problem that cuts through
governmental divides. The various ministries and
government bodies in Singapore may work well
together in the aftermath of a crisis, but we need to
be certain that we can sustain the momentum.
Equally important, we must ensure that our
coordination in the lead-up to crisis situations falls
into place as a matter of routine. Networking will

###### isolated and episodic, and not at all representative of the transnational terrorism facing us today. Yet, these early events should be understood in their historical contexts, serving as milestones of our collective past. We dealt with them firmly and with resolve. We remember them as early challenges to our statehood.

Even before the country gained its independence,
Singaporeans had to contend with sustained periods of
danger. The Communist insurgency of the 1950s and
1960s gave rise to various acts of subversion and civil
uprising. Elements were seeking then to install a
Communist order in both Singapore and Malaya. The
authorities carried out a series of successful operations
against pro-Communist agents during those turbulent
times.

###### THE MACDONALD HOUSE BOMBING

Even as Singapore moved towards statehood, the
fledging government had to confront many security
threats. A grave act of sabotage was the MacDonald
House incident on 10 March 1965, during the period
known as the Indonesian Confrontation, when the
then Indonesian government opposed Singapore’s
merger with Malaya to form a federal Malaysia. A bomb
explosion at MacDonald House along Singapore’s
Orchard Road killed three and injured 33. The aim of
the attack was to create public alarm and panic as well
as lower public morale.

Although the incident did come as a shock to many in
Singapore, the operatives behind the MacDonald
House bombing were apprehended, tried and
convicted - an early testament to the determination of
the Singapore authorities to counter terrorism
decisively. The country was able to recover quickly
from this event.


-----

###### THE LAJU INCIDENT

Nine years later, on 31 January 1974, four men armed
with submachine guns and explosives attempted to
storm the Shell oil refinery complex on Pulau Bukom.
The group comprised two Japanese nationals from the
Japanese Red Army and two Arabs from the Popular
Front for the Liberation of Palestine. Their goal was to
disrupt the supply of oil from Singapore to countries
such as South Vietnam, which had been engaged with
the United States in a bitter war against the
Communist North.

The operation, however, went awry and the terrorists
had to flee the scene. They hijacked the ferryboat Laju
at the Bukom jetty and headed out to sea. But the
group was quickly intercepted and surrounded by
marine police boats, customs launches and navy
gunboats. Following several days of intense
negotiations, the terrorists agreed to release the
crewmembers they were holding hostage in exchange
for a party of guarantors for their safe passage. A week
after the abortive attack on Pulau Bukom,


arrangements were made to transfer the terrorists from
the Laju to the airport, where they surrendered their
arms. The following day, 8 February, the terrorists left
Singapore for Kuwait, bringing to an end a dramatic
sequence of events.

###### THE SQ 117 HIJACK

On 26 March 1991, at about six in the evening,
Singapore Airlines (SIA) flight SQ 117 took off from
Subang Airport in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, with 129
passengers and crew onboard. En route to Singapore,
four passengers who claimed to be members of the
Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) took control of the
aircraft. At about 10pm, SQ 117 landed at Singapore’s
Changi Airport. The hijackers demanded the release
from detention of former Pakistani Prime Minister
Benazir Bhutto’s husband and other PPP members.
They also asked that the plane be refuelled, so that
they could fly to Australia.

Singapore immediately activated a high-level crisis
team. Early the following morning at 2.30am, SQ 117
was moved to an outer tarmac. The hijackers pushed
two SIA stewards out of the plane, injuring them.
They also threatened to kill one passenger every 10


-----

minutes after dawn if their demands were not met.
The situation was grave. An order was given to storm
the aircraft. Elite commandos entered the plane in the
early dawn hours, killing the four Pakistani hijackers
and freeing unharmed all 118 passengers and nine
crewmembers.

###### “Unlike some other countries, Singapore does not roll over and play dead when threatened with a gun. It can and will fight back, effectively, ruthlessly.”

_The Straits Times, 28 March 1991_

###### THE NEW FACE OF TERRORISM


A decade on, terrorism continues to cast a dark
shadow worldwide, threatening peaceful societies and
established governments. From the 1993 bombing of
the World Trade Center in New York, to the 1995 sarin
gas attack in a Tokyo subway, and the 1998 US embassy
bombings in Kenya and Tanzania, acts of terrorism have
led to numerous casualties across several continents
over the past few years.


Osama bin Laden’s Al-Qaeda network and its affiliates,
which were behind much of the terrorist violence of
the past decade around the world, present a new form
of terrorism that is radically different from what
Singapore and the rest of the world have been familiar
with. Nonetheless, we have not stood idle in the wake
of some of their recent operations.

Thirty-one persons were arrested and detained in two
security operations against Jemaah Islamiyah in January
and September 2002. Seven other persons were
arrested and detained between October 2002 and
December 2003. In January 2004, restriction orders
under the Internal Security Act were issued against 12
persons. Many of those under detention or restriction
orders were members, sympathizers or supporters of JI,
while the rest were members of or affiliated to the
Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) in the Philippines.

Authorities revealed that the Singapore JI operatives
were planning to attack a range of targets in
Singapore, including Western interests and local
installations. They had sought to obtain tonnes of
ammonium nitrate to be used for truck bombs. JI also
planned to hijack an airplane and crash it into
Singapore’s Changi Airport. Andrew Tan, a terrorism
analyst at Singapore’s Institute of Defence and
Strategic Studies, noted that if realized, the JI attacks
would have had grave consequences for Singapore.

“Had these attacks succeeded, not only would they
have inflicted heavy civilian casualties, they would also
have had a devastating effect on the economy and
shattered business confidence, with potentially
uncertain consequences for communal relations as
well,” he commented.

Investigations further uncovered an elaborate network,
in which local cell members worked under the
direction of JI leaders based outside Singapore, and
under the guidance of Al-Qaeda-linked agents. Through
a combination of good intelligence and early action,
Singapore was able to thwart the planned attacks.


With their capture, JI operations in Singapore have
also been severely disrupted.

However, the threat will persist if JI terrorists intent
on targeting Singapore are at large in the region. JI
and MILF networks in Singapore may have been made
ineffective by recent actions. Yet, in the longer term,
the spectre of terrorism will hang over South-east Asia
as long as JI-linked schools continue to train militants
who receive instruction in camps like those under the
MILF in Mindanao. At the same time, we must also
guard against other extremist threats. The danger to
Singapore’s security remains.


###### “One cannot forget that since the September 11 attacks on the United States, Jemaah Islamiyah has been one of the most active Al-Qaeda affiliates, and Southeast Asia one of the most important theatres of operation. . . It would be foolish to underestimate JI’s capabilities or goals.”

SIX [NATIONAL SECURITY: A NATIONAL EFFORT]


###### efore the events of September 11 highlighted the new era of transnational
## B
###### terrorism, Singapore’s national security strategy had focused largely on building strong external defence capabilities. Singapore assembled a credible, citizen- based defence force. Well trained and well equipped, it was tasked with meeting clear military challenges from state-based threats. It was chiefly a conventional army geared towards fighting a conventional war.

At home, no less importantly, the Singapore Police
Force and other homefront agencies were responsible
for internal order and security. They dealt successfully
with a wide range of threats, from Communist
subversion to dangers posed by foreign terrorist
elements. In the international arena, the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs focused on diplomacy and managed
Singapore’s external relations.

But the regional security environment of today is
different and complex. Singapore finds itself confronted
by a form of terrorism that transcends borders. This


terrorism, as highlighted earlier, has a global reach, is
rooted in ideology, and employs sophisticated methods
to achieve catastrophic outcomes.

###### FEATURES OF TRANSNATIONAL TERRORISM

Global Ambitions, Global Reach: Modern transnational
terrorism has taken on a clear international dimension,
with a global agenda and global network. Many other
terrorist groups were more limited in their aims and

areas of operation.
Examples include the
Liberation Tigers of
Tamil Eelam, the Irish
Republican Army and the
Basque separatist group
ETA. In South-east Asia,
for instance, the Abu
Sayyaf operates mainly
against the Philippines
government. These
groups generally mount
terrorist activities largely
within their own

_Abu Bakar Bashir, spiritual_

national boundaries. _leader of Jemaah Islamiyah._


-----

###### THE ROLE OF MIKE AND SAMMY

_Jemaah Islamiyah’s terror plot against_
_Singapore was not entirely home-grown. JI_
_members received critical help from two_
_foreign operatives, codenamed “Sammy” and_
_“Mike”. Sammy, who was subsequently_
_identified as Mohamed Mansour Jabarah, a_
_Canadian national of Arab origin, was an Al-_
_Qaeda agent dispatched to Singapore to assist_
_the local JI cell in surveillance and the_
_selection of targets. He has since been_
_captured by US forces. Mike, who was also_
_involved in directing the Singapore JI plot,_
_was the name given to Fathur Rohman Al-_
_Ghozi, an Indonesian bomb expert who had_
_served with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front_
_in the Philippines. He was captured in the_
_Philippines and subsequently shot dead three_
_months after escaping from detention._


However, the transnational terrorism of the 21st
century is strikingly different. Osama bin Laden’s AlQaeda has explicit global aims. It seeks to destroy the
United States and its Western allies, and establish panIslamic caliphates, overturning the international
political order. In its quest, Al-Qaeda has spawned a
network of affiliated terrorist groups across the globe
that subscribes not only to its extreme terror tactics
but also to its deviant ideology. Jemaah Islamiyah, a
movement inspired by a similar vision for the world, is
its principal South-east Asian representative.

The Singapore JI plot highlighted the international
nature of the struggle. After authorities had
uncovered the plan against the country, their


subsequent investigations revealed that while the
surveillance work was conducted by Singaporeans, the
planning was done by an Al-Qaeda operative of Arab
descent holding a Canadian passport. The bomb maker
was an Indonesian living in the Philippines.

###### “The most alarming aspect of the attacks on September 11th is that they conform to a trend in international terrorism that has emerged in recent years…the infliction of mass, indiscriminate casualties by enigmatic adversaries, striking far beyond terrorism’s traditional operational theatres in Europe and the Middle East.”

_Dr Bruce Hoffman_
_Terrorism Analyst at the RAND Corporation_
_8 October 2002_

Ideological Perversion: Underpinning transnational
terrorism is an extremist ideology that justifies terror
attacks against civilized and open societies. It is an
ideology based upon a gross misreading of Islamic
religious texts, which is then used to rationalize
current acts of terrorism. It debases concepts like
jihad. All who stand in the way are considered
legitimate targets, even co-religionists who do not
share the same degree of fervour.

The current terrorist threat against Singapore has deep
ideological roots. The social profiles of the JI suspects
who had been arrested were no different from those
of normal Singaporeans. They were educated, held
stable jobs, and had families. They were neither


-----

destitute nor disenfranchised nor dispossessed. Yet,
they shared a willingness to cause destruction and kill
others in the name of a higher spiritual calling. We
have to recognize this extreme element and remain
conscious of this ideological dimension when dealing
with transnational terrorism.

Sophisticated Methods, Catastrophic Outcomes:
Transnational terrorism is characterized by a high
degree of operational and technical sophistication,
making attacks more lethal and dangerous. Al-Qaeda
and its subsidiary groups have repeatedly shown a
capacity to mount multiple, well-coordinated strikes.


_More than 200 people lost their_
_lives in the October 2002 Bali_
_bombing._

The September 11 attacks, where flight-trained
terrorists were able to commandeer four separate
airplanes, are well documented. But Al-Qaeda and its
affiliates have been able to maintain the momentum,
and subsequent incidents in Riyadh, Istanbul and
Madrid demonstrated their ability to launch highly
synchronized terror bombings that resulted in
hundreds of casualties.

Singapore’s Minister for Home Affairs Wong Kan Seng
has noted the fanaticism in modern-day terrorism.


-----

“Nothing is unthinkable,” he observed. “This moral
free-fall and lack of restraint is what makes us sense
that the scale of violence of this current terrorism has
no boundaries other than what the imagination
supported by opportunity and access to relevant
resource can achieve.”

Such sophisticated methods and tactics have allowed
modern terror networks to seek catastrophic
outcomes from their actions, looking to inflict
maximum casualties. Attacks are often aimed at
defenceless civilians, with little regard for human life,
instead of hardened military targets. In an assessment
of likely terrorism trends for 2004, terrorism analyst
Rohan Gunaratna noted that Al-Qaeda poses more
threat to such soft targets. “Because of government
hardening of military and diplomatic targets, terrorists
will shift their attacks to economic targets and
population centres,” he wrote.

The number of fatalities arising from a terrorist attack
using weapons of mass destruction is likely to be
significantly higher. While recent terrorist incidents
have mainly employed conventional explosives, there
is growing evidence that terrorist groups would seek
to obtain chemical, biological and radiological
weapons. It is crucial, therefore, that their efforts be
stopped. In a recent speech, Singapore’s Defence
Minister RADM Teo Chee Hean warned, “The threat of
terrorism is amplified by the risk of proliferation of
weapons of mass destruction.” He spoke of a
nightmare scenario of terrorists and rogue regimes
collaborating in the use of weapons of mass
destruction - a scenario within the “realm of
possibility”. “If terrorists were to set off a nuclear
device or chemical or biological agents, the damage
and panic would be massive,” he said.


###### STRATEGIC CONVERGENCE


Clearly, the new security environment facing us is
complex and varied. It does not permit us to simply
say that we are a nation either at peace or at war.
Consequently, Singapore’s definition of national
security must extend beyond the containment of
conventional threats. It must take into account
transnational terrorist threats from non-state elements.

The current structure for dealing with national
security is characterized by sharp distinctions between
foreign and domestic interests, and between external
and internal issues, with functions largely performed
by individual agencies. The emergence of transnational
terrorism has created a new effect in national security
policy and practice - the blurring of boundaries
between government bodies responsible for national
security. The separate and apparently distinct
functions and capacities of the government agencies
involved in national security converge when dealing
with transnational terrorism. In devising a new
approach to managing national security, the key lies,
therefore, in strengthening coordination and
integration among government agencies.


###### POLICY CHALLENGES


The Government has to examine some critical issues
that will shape our long-term national security strategy.

First, can we be totally safe? While the outcome of a
conventional war can be definitive, the same cannot be
said of the campaign against transnational terrorism.
Given the nature of these terrorist threats, absolute
security is unattainable. Even if the Government

###### SARS – A VALUABLE LEARNING EXPERIENCE FOR SINGAPORE

_The unexpected outbreak of SARS (Severe Acute_
_Respiratory Syndrome) in 2003 taught Singapore_
_many valuable lessons. Although it was not a_
_case of bio-terrorism, it served as a useful_
_exercise for government authorities, businesses_
_and the public in tackling the spread of an_
_infectious disease. Furthermore, SARS impacted_
_not just Singapore’s health system, but also had_
_significant effects on the economy and daily life._
_SARS had to be defeated not only through the_
_efforts of doctors and nurses, but also through the_
_work of all Singaporeans. The episode_
_demonstrated the need for tight inter-agency_
_coordination and widespread community_

aspires to achieve it, attempting to plug every
conceivable capability gap will become an immense
drain on our resources. As there are other national
concerns such as education, housing, good and
affordable health care, and sustainable economic
growth, there is a need to prioritize and strike a
balance between different goals. Security issues
cannot become an overriding concern that displaces
other national imperatives.

Second, what must change in our processes and
structures? Having separate, specialized security
processes can help sharpen the responses needed for


specific problems. But seen against the context of
threats to national security, separate processes, for
example, to deal with internal and external threats
would not be optimal when the line between the two
has blurred. The SARS crisis has taught us the
importance of a total approach to a national problem.
Security requires us to confront a spectrum of threats,
and for that, we would need to have a comprehensive
approach and an over-arching strategy.

We are familiar with a hierarchical organizational
structure where clear lines of command and control
have always proven to be expeditious. The hierarchical


-----

structure favours consolidation, and a common vision
and purpose. The national security mission of today,
however, is complex. It involves too many entities and
it is not possible to bring them all under one roof. The
network approach would be a better fit for Singapore,
given our small size and limited resources. This
network, though, would need direction and
coordination from a central hub that has sufficient
influence to motivate constituent agencies. It would


_HAZMAT (Hazardous Materials) teams train for both civil and_
_security emergencies._

also need dedicated and forward-looking staff to
anticipate, cope with and direct future events.

In short, the organizational challenge of national
security is to mobilize, coordinate and lead
government agencies, the business community and
the general public to make Singapore better prepared,
more secure and more responsive to an array of
threats.

###### ingapore recognizes the diverse and constantly evolving nature of terrorism.
## S
###### To fight the terrorist threat in the long haul, the Government has adopted a multi- ministry networked approach. Networking integrates the work of otherwise separate bodies, enables inter-agency coordination and allows us to leverage upon the strengths of diverse organizations.

Traditionally, no single central body has directed
Singapore’s national security apparatus. Instead,
various ministries share jurisdiction over securityrelated functions. Defence against conventional
external threats comes under the Singapore Armed
Forces and the Ministry of Defence. Internal security
has been the responsibility of Home Team agencies,
such as the Police and the Ministry of Home Affairs.
However, the problems of transnational terrorism
present scenarios that involve multiple authorities and
require varied expertise. No single agency will have all
the resources or capabilities needed to handle the
range of threats at all levels.


###### THE HOME TEAM

_Agencies within the Ministry of Home Affairs_
_are organized around the Home Team concept._
_It comprises the MHA Headquarters and the_
_Singapore Police Force, the Singapore Civil_
_Defence Force, the Internal Security_
_Department, the Immigration and Checkpoints_
_Authority, the Prisons Department, the Central_
_Narcotics Bureau, the Commercial and_
_Industrial Security Corporation (CISCO), and_
_the Singapore Corporation for Rehabilitative_
_Enterprises (SCORE)._
_Many different_
_organizations, a_
_multiplicity of purpose,_
_but one shared goal of_
_making Singapore the_
_best home for all, one_
_which is safe and secure._


-----

How can this networked government be responsive and
effective? A few critical efforts must be undertaken.
First, an autonomous and influential node should be
established at the centre of government to coordinate
national security policies. It must be a strong centre
which sets clear policy directions, but which leaves
operational coordination and responses to other
agencies. Structures and processes should be
introduced to help maintain discipline and continuity.
Where possible, structures should be built on what we
already have to maintain a clear focus. Those that have
proven to be robust should be allowed to continue to
operate.

Next, the Government will put in place strategic
forums to discuss critical issues and to promote a


_Army-Police patrols at Changi Airport – a practical example of_
_inter-agency coordination and convergence._

shared understanding of security concerns among all
security policy-makers and practitioners. A national
security strategic planning and policy process should
be institutionalized.

Over time, there may be a tendency for organizations
to expand rather than to build alliances. Networks and
coordinating structures must be encouraged, as they
will help agencies to leverage on each other’s
strengths, rather than duplicate resources and build
competing capabilities.

While structures and processes for effective
networking can be put in place, the real emphasis
should be on cultivating a culture of collaboration.
We have to nurture a propensity to think about how


-----

we can achieve more as a team even as we play our
functional roles. The key to doing this is to develop a
common vision and invest in team building.

###### NATIONAL SECURITY ARCHITECTURE

What are the elements of Singapore’s revised national
security architecture? Essentially, we have put in place
a robust system that organizes the various agencies
around the three essential security pillars of policy,
operations and capability development.

###### Policy Coordination

For effective policy coordination, a new National
Security Coordination Secretariat (NSCS), working
under the guidance of the existing Security Policy
Review Committee (SPRC), has been institutionalized
at the heart of the Singapore Government.

Security Policy Review Committee: The Coordinating
Minister for Security and Defence chairs this
Committee, which also comprises the Ministers for
Defence, Home Affairs and Foreign Affairs. The
Committee meets regularly to guide national security
strategy and policy formulation. It examines the
country’s most critical national security capability
development goals, discusses critical issues and threats,
and reviews prevailing national security measures.

National Security Coordination Secretariat: The
Secretariat is an important central hub located within
the Prime Minister’s Office, tasked with national
security planning and the coordination of policy and
intelligence issues. A Permanent Secretary for National
Security and Intelligence Coordination has been


appointed to head the Secretariat. The Permanent
Secretary will report directly to the Prime Minister
through the Coordinating Minister for Security and
Defence. He will chair a National Security Coordinating
Committee comprising other permanent secretaries.
This Committee will be responsible to SPRC for
security policy coordination. In addition, the
Permanent Secretary will also chair an Intelligence
Coordinating Committee which will be in charge of
coordinating Singapore’s counter-terrorism
intelligence activities.

The National Security Coordination Secretariat
depends on two key agencies - the National Security
Coordination Centre (NSCC) and the Joint Counter

groups to undertake policy, planning and risk- There are established arrangements in Singapore to

the work of the various intelligence agencies and
departments in Singapore. In fact, drawing from our experience with SARS, we

know that national crises may come in unexpected
forms. The threats and challenges we face are
unpredictable and may cut across the ambit of a
number of ministries and agencies. A robust crisis
management framework is required to coordinate
national responses, allocate resources and manage farreaching consequences and implications. For better
operational coordination, the Ministry of Home Affairs
has introduced a Homefront Crisis Management
System consisting of a Homefront Crisis Ministerial
Committee (HCMC) and a Homefront Crisis Executive
Group (HCEG).

Homefront Crisis Ministerial Committee: The HCMC is
chaired by the Minister for Home Affairs and

guidance on the handling of crises with the aim of
maintaining normalcy as far as possible.

Homefront Crisis Executive Group: The HCEG is a
decision-making group, staffed by high-level policy
decision-makers from the various ministries and
government agencies. It is led by the Permanent
Secretary of the Ministry of Home Affairs. Generally, the
responsibility of the HCEG is to provide policy guidance
and strategic decisions on the management of major
crises. It will also provide operational coordination
support to the Ministerial Committee, resolve crossministry issues and ensure that decisions and directives
from the Ministerial Committee are implemented. The
HCEG is supported by multi-agency and multi-discipline
Crisis Management Groups where cross-agency issues
can be coordinated and resolved quickly.

###### Capability Development Coordination

Understanding Networking: A network must be
supported by individuals equipped not just with their
respective skills and specialties, but also with a
common understanding of Singapore’s national
security strategy and policies. The Government will
implement several programmes to further inter-agency
exchanges.

For a start, a national security course will be conducted
for senior security practitioners. The course, to be
coordinated by the National Security Coordination
Centre, will focus on the inter-agency and networkcentric character of Singapore’s national security
architecture. It will be useful to the national security
community in a number of ways. It enables a better
understanding of transnational terrorism and explains
the need for continued vigilance. It enhances the


awareness of the specific organizations, linkages and
processes that have been created or strengthened to
deal with national security issues. In addition, it
increases awareness of the various national security
policies, and capability development and contingency
plans.

The Government will also hold annual national
security seminars for national security agencies. The
seminars are organized by the National Security
Coordination Centre. The Coordinating Minister for
Security and Defence will use the occasion to present
the broad national security objectives for the
immediate future. The National Security Seminar will
help to align individual government ministries and
agencies with the larger national security picture and
keep them updated on government policies. In this
regard, it will provide insights into current issues and
help explain new security initiatives.

Anticipating Surprises: In the longer term, we need to
establish a risk-assessment and horizon-scanning
capability to anticipate strategic surprises. In a world

-----

where threats can come right out of the blue, as we
have learnt from our experience with SARS, it is useful
to have a framework to help us deal with them in a
coherent way.

Uncertainty and unpredictability are the key
challenges, and our focus will be on anticipating
surprises. Deputy Prime Minister and Coordinating
Minister for Security and Defence Dr Tony Tan has
warned that globalization and our open borders
present many more possibilities for the unexpected,
which can inflict great damage and even alter our way
of life. “SARS, for example, caught us completely by
surprise,” he noted. “We have learnt many valuable
lessons from the experience, but the next strategic
surprise may be very different from the last. Beyond
the actual damage, the psychological impact of these
surprises can be extremely serious and we would need
to guard against being dislocated by such shocks.”

The Government will strengthen risk-assessment and
horizon-scanning capabilities to bring together
different agencies in the tasks of monitoring and
authoring scenarios, assessing risks and sounding early
warnings. We will also work with think-tanks and
research institutes, such as the International Centre for
Political Violence and Terrorism Research at the
Institute of Defence and Strategic Studies to develop a
common, in-depth understanding of the terrorism
problem, especially its ideological underpinnings.

###### EVOLVING ARCHITECTURE

The series of security structures and programmes
outlined here serves to fully equip the Government to
deal with various contingencies, whether episodic or
of a prolonged nature, whether focused internally or
with an external dimension. In summary, the National


Security Coordination Secretariat will provide overall
security policy direction in the national counterterrorism effort. It will also coordinate Singapore’s
national intelligence agencies. As structures cannot
remain inflexible in the face of evolving threats, we will
continue to strengthen and upgrade the national
security architecture to meet new challenges.

###### PREVENTION


Prevention represents the most critical layer of
defence against terrorism. A successful strategy saves
lives, preserves property, and avoids potential
disruption to our economy and society. It entails an
integration of effective diplomacy, good intelligence
work, and strong border controls. Where we can, we
must ensure that terror threats are eliminated before

###### WHAT ARE SOLAS AND THE ISPS CODE?

_The International Convention for the Safety of_
_Life at Sea (SOLAS) is one of the most important_
_international conventions dealing with_
_maritime safety. It is also one of the oldest, with_
_the first version having been adopted at a 1914_
_convention. Since then, four other SOLAS_
_conventions have been held. SOLAS specifies_
_standards on safety for the construction,_
_equipping and operations of ships._

_Security) Code contains mandatory detailed_
_security-related requirements for governments,_
_port authorities, port facilities and shipping_

_ship operators to calibrate preparedness levels_
_and potential responses to corresponding_
_threat levels. ISPS-compliant ports put in place_
_a wide series of security plans, with regular_
_assessments and drills._


-----

Singapore was also the first port in Asia to implement
the US Container Security Initiative (CSI) in January
2003. The CSI aims to screen high-risk containers
before they arrive at American ports.

In other areas of maritime security, Singapore
cooperates closely with member states of the
International Maritime Organization to formulate
measures to enhance security. Singapore has
implemented special amendments to the International
Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) and the
International Ship and Port Facility Security Code (ISPS
Code).

###### Successful Intelligence Coordination

One critical component in combating transnational
terrorism is good intelligence.  Accurate and early
intelligence allows authorities to disrupt terror plots

_Mas Selamat Kastari, the head of JI in Singapore, was arrested in_
_Indonesia following a tip-off from Singapore intelligence agencies. He was_
_accused of plotting an airborne attack on Singapore’s Changi Airport._


and arrest key operatives before attacks can be
launched.  The foiling of the JI plots stemmed from
effective intelligence work.  Singapore’s intelligence
agencies also cooperate closely with their regional
counterparts on information exchanges.  The arrest in
Indonesia of Mas Selamat Kastari, the Singapore JI cell
leader, and the arrest in Thailand of Arifin Ali, a senior
member of the cell, demonstrated the effectiveness of
coordinated action and intelligence sharing with other
partners.

###### Effective Border Controls

The security of individual Singaporeans is
strengthened not just by protective measures at their
doorstep, but also by strong controls at the borders of
the country. Land, sea and air access into Singapore
must be fortified by effective controls. Stringent
measures are necessary to prevent the entry of
foreign terrorist elements and materials. Recognizing
the need to create a clear, coordinated border control
system, the Government merged the border control
functions of both the Customs and Excise
Department and the Singapore Immigration and
Registration to form the Immigration and
Checkpoints Authority, or ICA, on 1 April 2003. The
ICA now has seamless operational capabilities to
monitor and regulate the movement of goods and
people across Singapore’s borders.

###### PROTECTION

Improved capabilities to prevent terrorist actions will
help to reduce the overall threat. Nonetheless, we still
need to harden Singapore with a layer of strong,
protective measures. Rather than protect every
possible target, we have to prioritize our efforts, given


-----

_Standing guard at access points_
_to Jurong Island._

our limited resources, and focus on areas of greatest
concern.

###### Protection of Critical Infrastructure and Key Installations

Since the September 11 attacks, the Government has
enhanced the security of Singapore’s critical
infrastructure. We have instituted a range of security
measures, such as the installation of surveillance
cameras at power stations and water networks. More
broadly, a National Critical Infrastructure Assurance
Committee was formed to study the vulnerabilities of
Singapore’s critical infrastructure, and to recommend
the protective steps to take.

Security at other local and overseas key installations,
such as our embassies, has also been strengthened.


On Jurong Island, the site of Singapore’s petrochemical
hub, armed personnel, including Singapore Armed
Forces (SAF) troops, have been deployed to increase
security. They work closely with the Police Coast
Guard and commercial security forces that guard sea
and land access to Jurong Island.


Apart from the emphasis on the protection of key
installations, security at prominent public places such
as Boat Quay, the Esplanade and Holland Village has
been stepped up as well.

###### Enhanced Security at High-profile Events


Singapore plays host to various prominent
international events each year, many of which draw
top foreign dignitaries. These include regular fixtures
such as the Asian Aerospace airshow and the Asia


-----

Security Conference, also known as the Shangri-La
Dialogue.  A disruption of any of these events will not
only offer terrorists a great symbolic victory, but will
also inflict great harm on Singapore.  The Government
conducts thorough security assessments of each event.
Depending on the level of risk, the appropriate
security measures will be enforced to counter
potential terrorist threats.


extensive measures to deal with contingencies in the
Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) network. Agencies such as
the Home Affairs Ministry, the Singapore Police Force,
the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF), the Land
Transport Authority and rail operators work closely to
formulate detailed response plans. Exercises are held
to test disaster management procedures, and regular
security audits are conducted on emergency systems.

Many of the security measures in place at train
stations, such as tightened access to vital premises and
the use of close-circuit television to monitor the MRT
network, were
implemented as part of
the security planning for
Singapore’s train
systems. However, the
March 2004 terrorist
train bombings in
Madrid have prompted a
further review of land
transport security in
Singapore. Both the
Police and transport
operators will deploy
security personnel at
key locations. Public
vigilance broadcast
messages and posters
have also been
introduced.


###### Land Transport Security


The security of
Singapore’s land
transport system is a
critical issue for all
citizens. Millions of
journeys are made each
day on Singapore’s rail
and bus networks.  The
economy depends
significantly on the
efficiency of this mass
movement of people. It
is vital, therefore, for
commuters to be
assured that their
regular journeys are not
only fast and efficient,
but also safe and
protected. This is
something that the
Government and
transport operators are
working hard to ensure.

In terms of emergency
responses, there are


_Millions of journeys are made each day on_
_Singapore’s public transport system._


Furthermore, a Public
Transport Security
Committee has been
formed to undertake a
comprehensive review
of security arrangements,


-----

and to recommend and oversee improvements to the
security of the public transport system, covering
infrastructure such as bus interchanges, terminals, MRT
stations and depots.

###### Aviation Security


Singapore’s status as an international aviation hub is
not just a source of national pride, but is also the
foundation on which much of the economy rests. It is
a vital asset that must be well guarded. An Aviation
Security Task Force was established in December 2002
to comprehensively review security measures at
Changi Airport, on board SIA and SilkAir aircraft, and at
overseas destinations. The Task Force has since
completed its work. An ongoing National Civil Aviation
Security Committee will oversee the implementation
of the various recommendations and continue
monitoring developments in the global aviation
industry.

Some of the security measures enacted are visible to
the public. At Changi Airport, access to restricted areas
of the airport, aircraft and other key installations is
guarded and closely monitored. The Police and SAF
mount joint patrols of the airport concourse and other
sensitive areas. All checked-in baggage is also screened
through an in-line baggage screening system.

In the air, Singapore’s two main airlines have moved to
tighten and control access to the cockpit, and improve
awareness in the cockpit of potential terrorist
situations. Both carriers have implemented measures
such as the installation of bullet-proof doors and
surveillance cameras for the cockpit entry area. The
most significant of the in-flight security measures is
the deployment of air marshals on selected SIA and
SilkAir flights.


The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore and the
Republic of Singapore Air Force will continue their
round-the-clock air defence capability, and remain on
the alert for civilian airliners that may be hijacked for
use as suicide weapons.

_Air defence detachments keep watch over_
_the security of Singapore’s skies._

###### Maritime Security

Since the September 11
attacks, security
measures in the
Singapore Straits and
territorial waters have
been constantly
reviewed and upgraded.
The maritime security
agencies, such as the
Republic of Singapore
Navy (RSN), the Police
Coast Guard (PCG), and
the Maritime and Port
Authority (MPA)
cooperate closely to
protect Singapore
against seaborne threats.
For example, RSN ships
escort selected highvalue merchant vessels
in the Singapore Straits
while PCG boats have
intensified patrols of
sensitive vessels berthed
in our territorial waters.

Among the security
measures that have been
implemented is the
marking out of routes for
ferries, pleasure craft and
commercial vessels to
keep them clear of
sensitive anchorages and
installations.  The

Government has also
strengthened security at
sea checkpoints
including the Singapore
Cruise Centre and Tanah
Merah Ferry Terminal,
and the waters around
Sembawang Wharves and
islands such as Pulau
Bukom.

An integrated
surveillance and
information network at
the Port Operations
Control Centre, known
as the Vessel Traffic
Information System or
VTIS, enables close
cooperation between the
various maritime
agencies. It allows the
Centre to monitor and
provide timely
information to vessels
plying the Singapore
Straits and territorial
waters.

The Government has
also set up a Maritime
Security Task Force to
look into further ways of
enhancing maritime
security and of
promoting Singapore’s
broader maritime


-----

interests. Singapore can be a useful reference port to
other countries keen on strengthening maritime
security.  For example, we have gone beyond the
provisions laid down by the International Maritime
Organization to also equip smaller craft with
transponder systems.


###### RESPONSE


Should terrorist atrocities occur, Singapore must have
the means of responding swiftly to restore the country
to a state of normalcy. Major efforts will range from
the saving of lives and the mitigation of the immediate
effects of the incident to the broader restoration of
economic activity. Emergency agencies, including the
SCDF and hospitals, hold frequent exercises to test
disaster processes and procedures.


_(a) Bombing response capabilities_
Bombing continues to be the favoured tactic among
terrorists, including those from Al-Qaeda and Jemaah
Islamiyah. While military and commercial explosives
have been used in terrorist bombs, stronger controls
on access to these explosives have led terrorists to
shift towards easily available dual-use materials. These
include ammonium nitrate and potassium chlorate.
Suicide bombers are also used to perpetrate these acts.

As bombing is the terror scenario that is most likely to
occur in Singapore, our security agencies have taken
note of the changing trends and adjusted our responses
accordingly. Besides stepping up our detection
capabilities at Singapore’s border checkpoints, post-blast
investigation capabilities are also being enhanced.


-----

_(b) Aircraft Hijacking_
Although aircraft hijackings began to lose favour
among terrorists in the last decade, the September 11
incident in the United States refocused global counterterrorism efforts on this tactic. Our security agencies
have stepped up airport security considerably in
response to this. As part of broader aviation security
measures, the Ministry of Home Affairs has established
an air marshal unit. Members of the unit serve as a lastresort attempt to thwart any hijacking while in flight.


###### Non-Conventional Attacks


Although less likely than conventional attacks, nonconventional threats by terrorist groups represent one
important focus for response agencies. To handle the
dangers posed by chemical, biological and radiological
attacks, the SCDF and SAF have both been steadily
building up their capabilities over the years. The Tokyo
sarin gas incident in 1995 was a major catalyst for
current improvements. Today, the SCDF has an
immediate response capability to handle chemical and
biological attacks. In January 2003, the existence of


the SAF CBRE (Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and
Explosives) Defence Group was revealed as well. The
Group aims to enhance capabilities against this multifaceted threat.

Meanwhile, the Defence Science Organization National
Laboratories (DSO NL) works closely with
counterparts in countries like the United States, France
and Sweden on CBRE-related research and
development efforts. It also hosts international
symposiums to promote the exchange of experiences
among industry experts on chemical and biological
agents. The Chemical Verification Laboratory at DSO is
only one of 15 centres worldwide accorded a special
status by the Organization for the Prohibition of
Chemical Weapons to test samples of suspected
chemical agents.

_(a) Chemical Response Capabilities_
Chemical weapons use the toxic properties of
chemical substances, rather than any explosive
properties, to produce physical or physiological effects
on targets. In their attacks, terrorists may use chemical
weapons, including mustard gas, sarin or cyanide. The
Government has invested heavily in building chemical
defence capabilities over the years, with valuable work
carried out by the Centre for Chemical Defence and
the Defence Medical and Environmental Research
Institute at DSO.

###### WHAT IS A DIRTY BOMB?

_Some fears have been expressed that terrorist_
_groups might resort to the use of “dirty_
_bombs”. This is a common name given to_
_devices that injure and kill through the_
_spread of radiation. A dirty bomb comprises_
_conventional explosives, such as dynamite,_
_attached to radiological material. When the_
_bomb is detonated, the dynamite acts as a_
_dispersal agent, propelling dangerous_
_radiological fragments through the air. Such_
_a bomb does not constitute a nuclear blast,_
_but the immediate blast may affect_
_hundreds, with many more exposed to_
_radiological contamination._


-----

###### BEATING THE NEW THREAT: EXERCISE DIAMOND SHIELD

_Ex. Diamond Shield was an integrated incident response_
_exercise organized to counter both chemical and_
_explosives threats. Units of the SAF CBRE Defence Group_
_were activated to respond to a complex scenario_
_comprising an Improvised Explosive Device (IED) and a_
_chemical device. The exercise featured search operations_
_involving robots and chemical detectors, the removal of_
_the IED, the decontamination and disposal of the toxic_
_chemical device, and the treatment of chemical_
_casualties. In their response to such a complex scenario,_
_the units demonstrated their capabilities to deal_
_effectively with a range of threats._

-----

_(b) Biological Response Capabilities_
The threat of bio-terrorism has taken a heightened
profile, as the potential for rogue states or terrorist
groups to acquire and use biological weapons such as
the smallpox virus has risen. The United States went
through an anthrax terror scare at the end of 2001.
Thus far, there has been no specific bio-terrorism
threat against Singapore. Nonetheless, we face high
risks because of our openness and high population
density, and must prepare accordingly.

Security agencies are working together with
Singapore’s health authorities to develop a nation-wide
surveillance and alert system for the early detection of
biological outbreaks. In addition, as these incidents
could potentially affect large numbers of people, our
medical authorities have looked into increasing their
emergency treatment capacity to handle a potential
influx of contagious victims quickly.

_(c) Radiological Response Capabilities_
Intelligence assessments indicate that the use of crude
radiological dispersal devices, or “dirty bombs”, may be
within the current capabilities of terrorist groups.
Such attacks may not necessarily cause as many
casualties as biological or chemical attacks. However,
they can spark off widespread alarm and mass panic.
To counter this threat, the Government has deployed
radiation detection equipment at border entry points
to screen containers and personnel for radiological
materials. Specialized detection and response
capabilities to deal with radioactive releases will also
be explored. In addition, the movement of radiological
materials in Singapore is closely regulated and
monitored by the relevant government agencies.


###### HOW DSO DETECTS ANTHRAX SPORES

_In the aftermath of the September 11_
_attacks, the United States faced an anthrax_
_scare, in which letters containing harmful_
_anthrax spores were sent to several public_
_figures. Copycat incidents then started_
_appearing in other countries, including_
_Singapore. A large number of hoax mail was_
_discovered with suspicious-looking white_
_powder which looked like anthrax spores._

_With their effective containment and_
_filtration capabilities, laboratories at DSO_
_are able to handle both chemical and_
_biological contamination. The suspect letters_
_and parcels were sent there for biological_
_analysis. DSO researchers were activated_
_even at odd hours, in order to conduct swift_
_checks of dubious powder found._

_A secure method of handling suspect mail._

###### LOOKING AHEAD

Beyond the specific steps described, there is more that
can be done.  The various measures listed can deter
most types of attack.  However, as terrorism presents a
wide spectrum of threats, we need to constantly assess
what we can improve on, and what we can prepare
against.  We must also continue to build core
capabilities in critical areas of defence, harnessing the
best technologies available.  Many of our current
preventive, protective and response capabilities are
based on good use of the latest technology.
For example, information technology played a large
part in the investigation of the JI plot against
Singapore.  We were facing IT-savvy terrorists.  The
Internal Security Department had to employ IT
forensic techniques to penetrate a web of terrorist


data, and useful information was eventually recovered.
Through such effective use of technology and
technical knowledge, Singapore can enhance its edge
in the deployment of an advanced national security
strategy.

The way ahead is clear.  Technology specific to the
counter-terrorism programme is one domain where,
currently, possibly the greatest potential for
development rests.  We must ensure that
improvements to both security hardware and
software are complemented by imaginative
approaches that constantly explore radically different
and new options.

###### efending Singapore is the Government’s most fundamental
## D
###### commitment to its citizens. Whatever the threat, whatever the time, this task remains critical to the country’s future security and prosperity. Transnational terrorism has the potential to hinder Singapore’s journey forward. It can destroy lives, disrupt the economy, and damage our collective identity as a nation.

Our security is threatened because we have adopted
an uncompromising posture on terrorism. Yet, on a
more fundamental level, Singapore’s very existence
presents problems for some. Singapore is a target for JI
activity because of its place as part of the Daulah
_Islamiyah Nusantara - a conception rooted in history_
and myth of a pan-Islamic superstate comprising much
of South-east Asia. As long as we remain a secular state
that represents modernity and progress, we will find
ourselves standing against the extremist visions of
terrorist groups.

Singapore is particularly vulnerable for a variety of
reasons. We have open borders and an open society.


Many American and other multinational corporations
are based here. Millions of tourists visit Singapore
each year. The economy is heavily dependent on
international trade carried out through extensive land,
air and sea links which must not be disrupted. The
society is cosmopolitan, making it easy for infiltration.

Ultimately, the new transnational terrorism does not
threaten Singapore’s very existence as an independent,
sovereign nation. Nonetheless, it has the capacity to
inflict serious shocks on our economy and society,
causing not only material and human damage, but also
psychological injury. It further has the potential to pit
different communities against each other, weakening
the multi-racial, multi-religious character of Singapore
that is vital to our success.

The national security strategy outlined in this
document maps out how Singapore can be defended.
It is a comprehensive solution designed to prevent
terrorist incidents, protect our vulnerabilities, and help
us respond effectively should attacks occur. The
Government has shared this with the public to provide
a common understanding on the threats we face, and
the steps we are taking to confront the challenges of
our times. It serves as a useful framework of reference
for all of us.


-----

But the battle against terrorism is not that of the
Government alone. Now, more than ever, Singaporeans
can see how the principles of Total Defence are
relevant and must be applied to this fight. The five
components of Total Defence - Military, Civil,
Economic, Social and Psychological Defence - provide
the framework for a comprehensive and coherent
response. We need to muster our collective resilience
and individual strengths to live with terrorism. This
has to be a united effort against a national threat.


###### WHAT IS TOTAL DEFENCE?

_Many people think of Total Defence as a_
_defence strategy or plan that is rolled out only_
_during times of war. But it is more than that._

_Total Defence is about the different things we_
_can do every day in every sector of our_
_society to strengthen our resilience as a_
_nation. When we take National Service_
_seriously, participate in civil emergency_
_exercises, upgrade ourselves and learn new_
_skills, build strong bonds with different races_
_and religions, and feel the pride of being_
_Singaporean, we contribute to Total Defence._
_Introduced in 1984, the concept of Total_
_Defence was adapted from the experiences of_
_Switzerland and Sweden. There are two_
_reasons why we adopted it. First, as a young_
_nation with a small population, we cannot_
_afford to maintain a regular armed force._
_Thus, we need to involve every Singaporean_
_to multiply our defence capability. Second, the_
_nature of modern warfare has changed. Wars_
_are no longer limited to the battlefield._
_Instead, potential aggressors can strike in less_
_obvious, non-military ways. The five elements_
_of Total Defence_
_work together as a_
_comprehensive_
_defence strategy_
_for Singapore._

###### WHAT IS EPIC?

_“EPIC”, short for “Emergency Public Information Centre”, is a_
_central information dissemination system, available at_
_<www.epic.gov.sg>. EPIC is designed to cater to the public’s_
_need for official information related to major emergencies of_
_nationwide impact, such as the collapse of a building or a big_
_industrial fire. The public will also be able to obtain security-_
_related information, such as what to do in the event of a_
_bomb threat. Information dissemination is made possible_
_through the coordination and integration of news releases_
_and announcements from the various participating_
_government agencies._

_These are some features offered by the EPIC website:_

_• Useful tips on how to prepare for various contingencies/emergency situations_

_• Search for news of loved ones as a result of a major emergency in Singapore_

_• Be alerted to emergency-related news via email_

_• Search for important hotline numbers in the event of a major emergency and other useful_
_contact numbers of emergency-related public services_

###### PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT


Since the September 11 attacks and the disclosure of
the JI plots, the Government has sought to increase
public understanding of the terrorist threat, and
highlight the roles each of us can play in the safety of
our family, community and nation.

Public preparedness and vigilance are important.
What should one do in the event of an emergency?
How best do we respond? Where do we go to get
more information? The Ministry of Home Affairs and
the SCDF have programmes to brief households on


-----

_Security posters on Singapore’s public transport system, reminding_
_commuters to be vigilant._

the critical steps to take in times of emergencies. In
the event that a catastrophic terrorist incident strikes
Singapore, citizens must be ready to respond; they
must be well prepared and well organized.

Beyond fending for themselves and their families,
individuals have broader responsibilities. Each of us
can serve as valuable eyes and ears of the national
security system by looking out for suspicious persons
or unattended items at public areas such as MRT
stations or the airport.
We can report possible
gaps in our defences if
we spot them.

The contributions
which one individual
can make should never
be underestimated. In


December 2001, it was an alert passenger
on board a flight from Europe to the
United States who spotted “shoe bomber”
Richard Reid. The passenger’s quick action
prevented a terrible airborne tragedy. At
home, it was through public tips that
authorities were able to uncover the full
extent of JI’s plots against local targets.

Commercial owners, too, have a duty to
provide security for their respective
buildings or premises. After the
September 11 attacks, the Government
hardened critical infrastructure and key
public installations. However, these
measures are no guarantee that a terrorist
attack against civil targets would not
happen in Singapore. The strikes against
nightclubs in Bali, cafes in Casablanca and the Marriott
Hotel in Jakarta show that terrorists target commercial,
retail and entertainment outlets.

The Ministry of Home Affairs and other agencies have
been briefing building managers on the need to step
up both their security provisions and response plans.
However, hard defences alone are barely sufficient. A
fundamental change in business mindset is required.
Companies must come to see security as an integral
issue in their work, and not as a peripheral concern.
They must be proactive
in constantly upgrading
their security and
emergency provisions.
The necessary steps to
take include business
continuity planning,
disaster planning and
security certification.


-----

###### SOCIAL HARMONY

At a more important level, even if terrorism inflicts
property or human damage, we cannot let it destroy
Singapore’s national psyche and sense of nationhood.
Crucially, terrorism must not be allowed to break
Singapore’s multi-racial accord and divide Singaporeans
along racial and religious lines. We have to respond as
one people, cohesive and determined.

Al-Qaeda and related terrorist groups around the world,
including JI, have rationalized their action in the name
of Islam. Fighting Western and other secular
governments, they seek to overthrow the existing
international global order and replace it with one
based on an erroneous interpretation of the religion.
Transnational terrorism is an elemental struggle
between competing ideologies. Al-Qaeda, with its antimodern message,
represents intolerance
and extremism. Many _up against developments which_
Muslims worldwide

###### threaten the harmony of our multi
have rejected Al-Qaeda’s
views of jihad and its
perversions of Islam.

How do we in Singapore
counter the divisive
messages from Al-Qaeda
and JI? The Singapore
Muslim community has
spoken out strongly
against the actions of JI.
It is moderate, tolerant
and law-abiding, and _Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong_
condemns the actions of

_18 August 2002_

the militants. All


_The bombing of the JW Marriott Hotel in Jakarta in August 2003_
_killed 13 and injured many more._

Singaporeans must also guard against extremist
interpretations of religious teachings.

The continued success
and viability of
Singapore rests
fundamentally on the
multi-racial, multireligious compact that
forms its cornerstone.
In generations past, we
were no stranger to
conflicts rooted in race,
religion and ideology. In
the 1950s and 1960s,
Singapore was a poor
and divided society with
various groups pulling
in different directions.
We recall tragic
incidents such as the


-----

Maria Hertogh Riots of 1950, the Prophet Muhammad’s
Birthday Riots of 1964, and the clashes between
communist sympathizers and authorities.


built up mutual understanding and common values.
All communities have contributed to Singapore’s
development and progress.


But this country
became independent
on the basis of a
peaceful co-existence
between the races.
Through the years,
nation-building has
enabled every
Singaporean to claim
Singapore as a home for
all. Living, studying,
playing and working
side by side,
Singaporeans of all
races and religions have


###### “We condemn terrorism and will not allow Islam to be misused by any individuals or groups for their violent and destructive agendas. The Muslim community has always and will continue to stand united with other fellow Singaporeans to protect this nation against terrorism.”


In order to deny
militants any ideological
space, Muslims must
speak out and denounce
those who distort Islam.
They have to engage the
extremists, from the
media to the mosque to
the madrassah, and
assert mainstream
Islamic values.
Singapore’s Senior
Minister Lee Kuan Yew
has highlighted this
point frequently. “The


-----

Muslim community must play a crucial role,” he said.
“Only Muslims can do this to challenge and correct
these perverted interpretations of Islam,” he stressed.

Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong has also emphasized
that “every community must speak up against
extremist voices that sow racial and religious discord
among Singaporeans.” Extremist elements, he said,
sought to determine the agenda for their community,
often against its interests, and those of the larger
society. “If you do not disown such views, in time,
they will gain legitimacy. Others will also come to
associate these extreme views with the community,
and distrust will set in.”

Singaporeans of other faiths have a role too. They
must be careful not to link acts that are perpetrated
by terrorists, whether globally or in Singapore, to the
local Muslim community and cause them to be


defensive for no reason other than sharing a common
faith. In their reporting and analysis of such events,
journalists can play a key role as well, by
understanding the local context and reflecting
correct perspectives in the news media.

Shortly after the September 11 attacks, Singapore
established Inter-Racial Confidence Circles (IRCCs) to
promote multi-racialism and inter-communal
harmony. The IRCCs serve as important platforms for
religious and community leaders to build personal
trust and confidence. Regular interactions will help
build mutual rapport between the races, and provide
opportunities for parties to address racial and
religious problems on the ground. In announcing the
setting up of the IRCCs in 2002, Prime Minister Goh
said, “The primary objective is to get our irrational
fears off our chest, and get to know each other
better.”


-----

To date, IRCCs have been formed in all 84
constituencies in Singapore. The IRCCs
complement the ongoing efforts of many in the
community - schools, religious institutions, civic
organizations, corporations - that have worked
tirelessly to strengthen community bonding and
social harmony.

###### “What if the terrorists had succeeded? Supposing the bombs had gone off, and innocent Singaporeans had been killed. What would have happened to our racial harmony? Then whatever we said about this being the work of a tiny extremist minority, there would have been heightened distrust and fear among the different communities. We could easily have had racial incidents, leading to retaliation and counter-retaliation. Overnight this would undo 40 years of building a multi-racial society. To forestall this, we set up the IRCCs. If any terrorist attack should happen, the community and religious leaders in the IRCCs would already have worked with each other, and built up trust and confidence in each other. ”


###### ROBUST SECURITY, RESILIENT NATION

Our Singapore story is the account of how a small
island-nation overcame its vulnerabilities and
prospered, despite overwhelming odds. The
comfortable life we enjoy today is built upon the
difficulties of yesterday. Previous generations have
weathered colonialism and the Japanese occupation,
and fought against Communism and communalism.
Their efforts have not been in vain; modern Singapore
stands as a testament to their courage and fortitude.

Today, we find ourselves confronted by the peril of
transnational terrorism. Elements from beyond and
within are seeking to destroy what we have built.
Thus far, we have beaten off the challenges that
threatened our security. Over the past two years, the
Government has done much to raise the standard
for security measures in Singapore. It has
comprehensively reviewed areas such as critical
infrastructure protection and border controls.
Beyond implementing robust security measures, it
has focused on shoring up psychological resilience.
It is vital that we remain undaunted as a people in
this battle against terrorism, as strong in mind as the
country is steadfast in purpose.

With an understanding of the trials of our times, we
must be prepared for and geared up to confront
further terrorist action. As long as the Government
stays resolute and the people remain united in the
fight against terror, Singapore faces a secure future.
Like our forebears, all of us who call this islandnation home must work together to build a lasting
legacy and write another shining chapter in the
Singapore story.
