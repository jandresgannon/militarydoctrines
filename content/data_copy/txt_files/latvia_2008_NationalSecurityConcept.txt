**National Security Concept**

The Saeima approved at its 2 October session a National Security Concept. The decision
to approve the National Security Concept was published in the 65[th] issue of Saeima
documents ("LV", No.165, 23.10.2008). – “LV” editorial office

**National Security Concept (Summary)**

The national security of the Republic of Latvia means the ability of the state and the
public to protect, strengthen and develop the interests of the state and the individual
security interests of every member of the population and the basic values as laid down in
the Constitution of the Republic of Latvia. National security policy is the sum of internal
and external policy measures targeted at the prevention of threats and potential risk
factors, as well as international co-operation and the strengthening of solidarity among
allied states.

The main task of the National Security Concept (hereafter – Concept) is to determine the
strategic basic principles, priorities and measures for preventing a possible threat to the
state. Many of the principles of operation included in the previous National Security
Concept remain unchanged, however new conclusions need to be reached on certain
issues.

Within a comparatively short period of time Latvia has become an equal partner in cooperation with other European countries in strengthening the security of the common
European space. During recent years certain positive changes have taken place in
Latvia’s external and internal security environment, however, there exist potential threats
to economic security, unresolved issues of environmental protection, and the problems of
organised crime and corruption. Latvia’s participation in international peace keeping
operations has given the state an opportunity to become more widely involved in global
political processes and to receive allied support in implementing national security
interests, however, at the same time this can give cause for terrorist organisations to
identify Latvia as a target.

Increasingly more often, global threats: terrorism, the spread of weapons of mass
destruction and threats to the environment – cause local and unforeseeable consequences.
Temporary and one-off measures with regard to individual threats will not make it
possible to stop these threats entirely. It is not possible to fight any of the types of the
aforementioned threats with the national means available to one single country. Thus the
importance of inter-state cooperation becomes ever greater.

An adequate level of security for Latvia may be achieved by implementing a united,
targetted and systematic state and public policy, ensuring a stable internal political, social
and economic situation, developing effective defence force bodies appropriate to the
security conditions, improving crisis management and civil defence systems,
strengthening the system and institutions of a rule-of-law state, encouraging involvement
and support of the public in achieving the goals of the national security policy, honouring


-----

international obligations and standards, as well as continuing active involvement in
European and transatlantic security, defence, political and economic structures. Thus an
especially important prerequisite for the successful implementation of the national
security policy of Latvia is public understanding of the goals stated in this Concept as
well as its involvement in and support for the implementation of these goals.

The priorities set forth in the Concept form the basis for activities of state institutions and
the promotion of mutual co-operation amongst them in shaping the comprehensive
security policy of the state and developing plans and programmes of individual sectors.

The priorities determined by the Concept must be taken into account when preparing new
policy planning documents and programme documents. Based on the priorities
determined by this Concept, the Cabinet of Ministers shall prepare the National Security
Plan which will set out next year’s priorities for the improvement of the situation as
regards national security..

**Introduction**

The opportunities and experience that Latvia has gained in the three years since
becoming a member of the European Union (hereafter - EU) and the North Atlantic
Treaty Organisation (hereafter – NATO), as well as the signing of the border treaty with
Russia and its ratification by the Saeima is confirmation of a positive improvement of the
national security environment of Latvia. Although many principles of operation have
remained unchanged since the approval of the previous National Security Concept,
changes have taken place in certain areas which affect national security and measures for
the prevention of new threats. An awareness of the newly-acquired experience and
opportunities, and an initial assessment allow us to draw up an appropriate National
Security Concept (hereafter – the Concept).

The main purpose of the Concept is to determine the strategic basic principles, priorities
and measures for the prevention of possible threats to the state.

In implementing security policy Latvia observes the principles of international law
included in the Charter of the United Nations (hereafter – UN), documents of the
Organisation for the Security and Cooperation of Europe (hereafter – OSCE), as well as
other international agreements binding to Latvia. The security policy of Latvia is
implemented without threat to other countries.

The situation in the area of national security is affected not only by internal factors – the
democratic base, economic development, the situation with respect to fighting crime,
social security, environmental quality and other factors, but also the foreign policy and
military policy situation.

An adequate level of security for Latvia may be achieved by ensuring a stable internal
political, social and economic situation, by developing effective structures of the defence
forces corresponding to the security circumstances, developing a crisis management
model corresponding to the present situation and perfecting the civil defence system,
strengthening the system and institutions of a rule-of-law state, encouraging the
involvement and support of the public in achieving the goals of security policy, observing
international commitments and norms, and continuing active involvement in
European and transatlantic political, economic, security and defence structures.

The status as a member country of NATO and EU continues to significantly improve the
external security environment of Latvia, maximally reducing the external military and
political threat. During a relatively short period of time Latvia has become an equal
partner in co-operation among European countries in enhancing the security of the
common European space. During recent years positive changes have taken place in the
external and international security environment of Latvia, however, there still exist
certain potential threats to economic security, unresolved issues of environmental
protection, problems of organised crime and corruption. Latvia’s participation in
international peace keeping operations has given Latvia the opportunity to become more
involved in global political processes and to gain allied support in implementing the


-----

interests of national security. At the same time, this is a reason for terrorist organisations
to identify Latvia as an object of their goals.

Latvia has become a member state of the most important global and regional international
organisations. The EU and NATO may be considered guarantors of Latvia’s
independence and security, and an opportunity for economic growth. By becoming a fully
fledged member state of EU and NATO, Latvia has achieved the most important foreign
policy goals of the last decade. Notwithstanding the small territory and limited resources
of the country, it is in the interests of Latvia to participate constructively and on equal
terms in international organisations, thus ensuring the most active role possible in
developing international security policy.

National security policy and achieving its goals is the responsibility of all state
institutions and the population.

**1. The national security of Latvia and national security policy**

The national security of the Republic of Latvia is a state achieved as a result of common
targetted measures implemented by the state and the public, in which the independence of
the state, its constitutional system and its territorial integrity, as well as free development
perspectives, welfare and stability of society are guaranteed.

The interests of national security include the ensuring of prerequisites necessary for the
long term development of the state and society, the preservation of the language and
culture of the population of Latvia, the maintenance of the defence system, ensuring
operations of the civil defence system, development of scientific and technical potential,
ensuring sustainable environmental development, and the security and development of
critical infrastructure, telecommunications and information technologies. National
security must also be assessed also in an international context, taking into account both
threats and opportunities, and the resources for addressing these.

The national security policy is a total of internal and external policy measures targeted at
identifying threats and potential risk factors, their possible reduction or prevention, as
well as international co-operation and the strengthening of solidarity among allied
countries.

Increasingly more often global threats cause local and unforeseeable consequences. The
main global threats are known, namely terrorism, the threat of the spread of weapons of
mass destruction, climate changes and related environmental risks. At the same time, new
types of threats have emerged, such as, for example, cyber-terrorism, giving rise to
additional challenges for security policy. Implementing only one-off and temporary
measures in relation to individual threats will not make it possible to stop these threats. It
is not possible to fight any of the aforementioned types of threat with solely the national
resources of one country, thus the importance of inter-state cooperation becomes ever
greater.


-----

The international situation, especially in certain regions of the world, may be noticeably
affected by the rapid economic development of states and an increase of their influence,
the issue of the decrease and availability of natural resources, and the tendency towards
increased arms drives. In our region the situation as regards conventional armament is
affected by a decrease in mutual trust and predictability, related to Russia’s unilateral
decision to terminate its performance under the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in
Europe.

An important factor of threat to national security are also the operations of foreign
security services in the territory of Latvia. The operations of the foreign security services
against Latvia and its interests may be divided into three types: political, economic and
military reconnaissance. Operations of foreign security services affect both the national
interests of Latvia as well as aspects of co-operation with NATO and EU.

In order for the state to be able to effectively address the entire spectrum of potential
problems, from natural and man-made disasters to economic, political or military crises the general crisis management capacity must be increased. Planned, harmonised and coordinated activities of state administration institutions, the public and the armed forces,
based on civilian and military co-operation, is still one of the most important
prerequisites for the efficient capability of the Latvian state to prevent, overcome and
deal with the consequences caused by the threats, both by its own resources and also with
assistance as stipulated in Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty.

National security is ensured by implementing a common, targeted and systematic
government and public policy – developing a stable internal, social and economic
environment, developing an effective internal system, National Armed Forces (hereafter
– NAF), consolidating crisis survival ability, developing a rule-of-law state, observing
international laws and participating in European and transatlantic political, economic,
security and defence structures and their international operations. The present situation is
characterised by the significant increase of the circle of state administration institutions
and non-governmental organisations whose role in international co-operation is
increasing.

Thus public understanding of the goals mentioned in this Concept and its participation in
and support for the implementation of these goals has become an especially important
prerequisite for the successful implementation of the national security policy of Latvia.

**2. Priorities for the prevention of threats to national security**

_2.1 Foreign policy_

Latvia’s foreign policy is directed towards protecting its national interests under rapidly
changing conditions of international politics, globalisation, extremism and climate
change.


-----

Participation in international organisations and maintenance of external relations is a
means to strengthen Latvia’s independence, security and economic growth, as well as
protecting its national interests in the wider world. Participation in the shaping of external
relations of international organisations considerably increases Latvia’s ability to
favourably influence international processes. This helps to increase and make more
effective Latvia’s contribution to international relations, and also increases the ability to
withstand international threats – politically (by making use of systems of international
laws and organisations), militarily and by transfer of socio-economic assistance and
know-how.

In order to reduce international threat, increasingly more often there is a need to become
involved in operations being implemented in crisis affected regions. As the need for
international co-operation grows, and also because of limited resources, co-operation
between the UN, EU, NATO and other governmental and non-governmental
organisations is important. Participation in the prevention of international threats is a way
of achieving, with comparatively limited resources, a more visible international role for
Latvia, especially within the EU and NATO..

Membership in EU and NATO provides Latvia with additional opportunities to positively
influence internal reform processes and co-operation with EU and NATO neighbour
countries. The goal of this policy is to achieve the resolution of conflicts and an increase
in stability and prosperity in countries geographically located next to the EU and NATO,
therefore also to Latvia, ensuring future development of mutually beneficial economic
contacts.

The fact that Latvia belongs to the developed European countries also means a high level
of moral responsibility and involvement which is characteristic of the political culture of
democratic countries.

Latvia’s foreign policy is directed towards strengthening co-operation within NATO and
the EU, as well as with North American and Asian democratic states. Latvia believes that
the USA is a strategic partner and that co-operation among European countries in the
processes of enhancing international security is irreplaceable.

Latvia’s priorities:

-  the promotion of further co-operation in the Baltic Sea state region;

-  the stabilisation of the security of the international environment by socio-economic
assistance and transfer of know-how;

-  the strengthening of democratic statehood in neighbouring countries wishing to join the
EU and NATO;

-  enhancing and increasing the functionality of organisations in which Latvia is a member
state.


-----

_2.2 Terrorism and critical infrastructure_

The strategic goal of Latvia is to restrict terrorism and extremism in all its manifestations,
to restrict political extremism and the most extreme forms of radicalism, to take measures
which would significantly reduce opportunities to carry out or encourage acts of terrorism
in Latvia or in other countries.

The level of threat of terrorism in the Republic of Latvia is relatively low, however,
Latvia cannot be separated from the rest of the world, where there is a general tendency
for the threat of terrorism to increase. As the international mobility of the population of
Latvia increases, the threat to Latvia’s residents outside the borders of Latvia also
increases. Considering that a characteristic of terrorism is its lack of regard for
nationality, it is very important to strengthen Latvia’s international co-operation with
state institutions and international organisations involved in the fight against terrorism.

To date operations of organisations which could be classified as terrorist have not been
identified in our country, nor have organisations or persons been found in Latvia who
engage in the direct radicalization of a particular social group or recruitment for terrorist
activities.

The territory of Latvia could be used for illegal transit and money laundering for
international terrorist organisations, and for the organisation of terrorist action in third
countries. In order to prevent criminal and terrorist groups using the Latvian banking
system or other means to achieve their goals, one of the priorities of our state is the
security and transparency of our financial sector, and upgrading our legislation to
correspond to international standards of combatting money laundering.

The least protected against terrorist attacks are places of mass concentration of the
population and critical infrastructure sites. The potential threat to transportation
(especially railway) infrastructure and objects important for national security must be
emphasised. To reduce the possibility of terrorist threats, targetted and planned activities
must be carried out to identify the objects most susceptible to possible acts of terrorism,
subversive acts or sabotage, and the level of their security must be increased and security
measures put in place.

In the near future electronic methods of attack will be used increasingly more often. With
the help of new information and communication technologies it is possible to destroy
public administration information systems and electronic communication networks, to
neutralise a country’s political, economic and military decision-making centres, to
misinform the public, and cause man-made incidents. Under conditions where the state
administration and economy depend on infrastructures made up of information and
communications (for example, national registers, the electronic signature system, banking
information systems, transport management information systems, means of electronic
communications) and the services provided by these means, the illegal use, damage,
paralysis or destruction of these systems may threaten a country’s national security,
public order or negatively affect its economic interests. To protect the state from such


-----

threat it is necessary to improve co-operation among the responsible institutions to
prevent cyber attacks and to overcome their consequences.

Latvia’s priorities:

-  to upgrade co-operation between state institutions and security services and to improve
preparedness in preventing threats of terrorism;

-  civil defence forces and the National Armed Forces must co-operate in dealing with the
consequences of potential disasters;

-  to improve the system for protection of critical infrastructure, including promoting the
co-ordination of measures to prevent cyber crime, to ensure uninterrupted internet
operation under emergency conditions and to educate the public in the field of
information and communication technology.

_2.3 Economic security_

Latvia’s economic security depends on stable economic growth, the balance between
expenditure and income, export, import and a steady growth in investments. In this
process Latvia’s goal is to ensure a stable and long-term national economic sovereignty.

As a small open market economy state, the main economic risk factor for Latvia is its
external sector. During recent years in Latvia’s national economy there has been a rise in
indicators which point to unbalanced economic development. An increased deficit in the
current account, high inflation, and other indicators present the threat of an overheated
economy.

The growth in productivity must be more rapid than the growth in salaries. Emigration of
the labour force must be reduced, a more effective use of labour force reserves must be
promoted in order to reach the Lisbon employment strategy goal of 70%.

Latvia has a relatively large number of jobseekers and economically inactive members of
the population who are not seeking work, but would be prepared to work if provided with
favourable working conditions.

Increased productivity will gradually reduce demand for labour. Increased salaries and
improved working conditions related to productivity will gradually reduce the number of
people leaving the country.

For the future strategic development of the Latvian economy, innovation as a factor
affecting competitiveness in a knowledge-based economy,and orientation to goods and
services with high added value are important, in addition to an increase in the production
of competitive goods and their export, and stepping up the representation of national
economic interests abroad. In order to ensure the prerequisites for the production of such


-----

goods and the provision of services with high added value, priority must be given to
education and training of the labour force.

The development of the national economy will be influenced by the ability to maintain
and increase the existing throughput of freight transit. The main tasks in developing
transit services is to ensure competitiveness of the service, the development of a common
harmonised tranasport infrastructure for both dometic and foreign freight transit, and the
development of Latvian port infrastructure.

Latvia’s participation in expanding the Transeuropean transport and energy network is a
priority. An important task is the development of a new interconnection in the supply of
energy between Poland and Lithuania, and increased capacity of the “Finland-Estonia”
interconnection which promotes competition among electricity suppliers in the market,
and increases security of the energy supply. Latvia, as opposed to its neighours –
Lithuania and Estonia – imports electric power. The basic guidelines for energy
development for 2007 – 2016 determined that by 2012 Latvia must provide 80% of its
electricity needs and by 2016 it must be at the level of 100%.

This may be achieved by diversifying the primary energy resources and their supply
lines, supporting investment in the prodution of energy from renewable energy resources,
and encouraging the production and wider use of bio-fuel. In using only renewable
resources and the co-generation cycle in the production of electric power, the Latvian
national economy may face a shortage of electric power. It is predicted that by 2015 the
deficit in electricity supply will reach 400MW, and in 2020 – 800MW. To prevent such a
situation, it is necessary to build new plants for the production of electric power – to start
using a natural gas combined cycle power station and solid fuel power station. To
successfully implement construction of new electric power stations and ensure Latvia’s
energy independence, it is necessary to amend the Law on Electricity Market, taking into
account the specifics of the sector.

National economic development interests must be borne in mind when participating in
the EU decision making process, with particular attention being paid to the discussion on
allocation of greenhouse effect gas emission quotas and further development of the
trading system of emission quotas (aviation, shipping), as well as similar trading schemes
for the emission of other air polluting substances (nitric oxide, sulphur dioxide) and
agricultural pollution.

The goal of Latvia’s regional development is to encourage and ensure a balanced and
sustainable national development, taking into account the whole territory of the country
and the characteristics, comparative advantages and growth potential of its individual
areas. The peculiarity of Latvia is its monocentric pattern of population distribution, with
a strong main centre – Riga – along with a wide, relatively evenly distributed network of
towns. The consolidation of this network of towns by developing functional links with
surrounding territories promotes the development of a multicentric state, which fosters
the conditions for a balanced development of the state. The insufficiently developed
insfrastructure in Latvia’s regions hinders the attraction of investment and thus – its


-----

socio-economic development and an enhancement of the quality of the environment.. For
the successful implementation of regional development, a varied range of support
instruments, appropriate to the development potential of the various territories of the
state, must be ensured.

Latvia’s priorities:

-  a reduction of the current account deficit and decreased inflation;

-  the diversification of energy supply, stockpiling reserves of oil products, ensuring the
provision of a basic capacity for production of electric power and development of
electrical energy interconnections;

-  encouraging the production of goods with a high added value;

-  encouraging an even and sustainable development throughout the territory of the whole
state;

-  the development of insfrastructure;

-  education and investment in the training of the labour force.

_2.4 National military defence_

At present there are no direct military threats to Latvia or the Baltic region as a whole.
The security situation in the Baltic Sea states region may be described as secure and
stable. Since joining NATO, the security and defence of Latvia has been based on
membership in the NATO collective defence system. This ensures that any possible
threat to Latvia is considered a threat to NATO, and defence of the country is no longer
solely a national task. Therefore Latvia’s primary interests in NATO are for the alliance
to continue to maintain its capacity and its effectiveness. With its membership in NATO
and the EU, Latvia’s security is even more directly affected by international security
processes and presentday security challenges. Since the security sitution in Latvia cannot
be separated from security in the world, both Latvia’s responsibility for interntional
security and the need to participate in the strengthening of it has increased.

Latvia supports the development of EU military capability, which in turn would promote
the contribution of European countries, Latvia among them, to the development of NATO
military capabilities, so that in future the EU could even more extensively become
involved in the prevention of international threats and crisis resolutions. A close military
co-operation between the Baltic states is of utmost importance, encouraging stability and
security in the Baltic region.

Thus the Latvian NAF are being prepared not only for the protection of the territory of
Latvia and for the carrying out of national defence tasks, but also to strengthen the
common military capability for the requirements of collective protection and participation


-----

in international crisis recovery operations outside the territory of Latvia. Development of
the armed forces is targeted towards preparing, supplying and maintaining the structures
of the Latvian NAF in response to the new challenges.

Latvia’s priorities

-  an improvement in the combat power of the NAF;

-  the strengthening of the military capability of NATO;

-  participation in international operations;

-  an active participation in the development of the EU common defence and security
policy.

_2.5 Social integration and the social environment_

Latvia’s rapid eonomic development, integration into the EU and openness to the outside
world is encouraging to the development of a harmonised civic society. The active
involvement of social movements, non-governmental organisations and individuals in
public and state administration processes are important in further strengthening and
ensuring openness in an open, democratic civic society, thus building up public trust in
the authority of the state. It is necessary to continue to the work of encouraging the
involvement of socially vulnerable risk groups of the population in the nation’s social,
political and economic life.

Social integration is one of the factors which stabilises the internal political situation in a
country. Its goal is to reduce social rejection and to encourage understanding among
ethnic groups. This may be achieved by improving the ties linking the government and
the population. The consistent consolidation of the Latvian language in all areas of public
life and encouraging its use among the population is an important factor in reducing
isolation of information spaces. Education has a special role in teaching and explaining
the Latvian language and history. An important part of the development of a civic society
is to continue social integration, increaseheightening of tolerance through education and
counteracting the bias to new phenomena of public life, as well as an improvement in the
naturalisation process and encouragement of national loyalty among both citizens and
non-citizens. An important factor in the development of a tolerant society is also
consistent action in reducing the elements promoting intolerance in the information
space.

Latvia’s priorities:

-  the strengthening of national awareness;

-  the consolidation of public involvement in political processes;


-----

-  the improvement of the social and economic environment;

-  encouragement of the naturalisation process;

-  working to reduce the divisions in education and the information space;

-  the reduction of extremism and intolerance.

_2.6 Border control and migration_

In ensuring the independence of the state and the promotion of internal security, the
ability to guard and control the country’s borders is essential. In this area risks are related
to illegal border crossing by persons, vehicles and freight, the illegal import into the
country of smuggled goods, arms, narcotic and radioactive substances and their further
passage to other EU member countries, as well as illegal migration, especially after
Latvia’s joining the Schengen Agreement and the removal of border controls on EU
internal borders. In the prevention of the aforesasid risks it is important that the State
Borderguard co-operates with the appropriate state institutions.

The Latvia’s eastern border is also the external border of the EU, and therefore it is the
goal of Latvia, together with other EU member countries, to reduce and prevent illegal
migration by protecting the EU external border. It is the fight against illegal migration by
third country citizens which has been central to the EU common migration policy since
its very beginning. A dialogue with EU and co-operation with countries of origin and
transit countries with regard to migration is crucial, and these processes are being stepped
up. Along with co-operation, of which the current goal is to reduce and prevent illegal
migration, there are measures to be taken to assist countries of origin to address the
problems which give rise to and encourage illegal migration. Illegal migration is a
multifaceted issue, and its related problems need to be addressed in all their dimensions.
The prevention of the risk of epidemics, epizootics and epiphytics in the process of
border control is also important.

The Hague Programme has set out the measures to increase prevention of all these types
of illegal migration in various policy areas, namely border security, illegal employment,
repatriation and the fight against terrorism and organised crime, and co-operation with
third countries.

Latvia supports the enhancement of practical co-operation among EU member countries
in migration control and its administration by defining common targets and priorities in
this area, the development of a common visa policy and co-operation with third countries
in the field of migration and asylum.

Latvia’s priorities:

-  to enhance border control in order to correspond to the requirements of the EU and the
Schengen Agreement;


-----

-  to upgrade immigration services, improve infrastructure and provision of strutural units
by increasing the number of staff and their level of education;

-  to undertake compensatory measures on EU internal borders, to control migration
processes within the country and to ensure the security of EU external borders;

-  to consolidate practical co-operation among EU member countries, especially as regards
the fight against crossborder organised crime;

-  to develop closer co-operation with third countries in the field of migration and asylum.

_2.7 Crime_

The basic goals of Latvia in the prevention of crime are related to increased security of
the individual, improvement of the common co-operation among EU member countries whose goal is the prevention of international organised crime, harmonising EU and
national legislation and threat prevention.

The security of the individual and the public is characterised by the general national
crime indicators. In Latvia at present, organised crime is basically connected to economic
crime, the distribution of narcotics, illegal migration as well as human trafficking.
However in the context of crossborder organised crime, Latvia is considered mainly as a
transit country.

A potentially dangerous factor is the integration of Latvia’s organised crime groupings
into the business environment and organisations, the expansion of international
communications and the representation of foreign groupings in Latvia. In future, the
threat caused to Latvia’s security by organised crime may increase. The possibility that
potential organisers of acts of terrorism may contact specific representatives of the
criminal world in order to obtain resources necessary for the realisation of their intentions
cannot be excluded.

As a result of the processes of globalisation and economic migration, the problem of
human trafficking has increased manyfold over the recent decade. Human trafficking has
wide international consequences, and action in this area should not be limited to national
and EU measures only. Closer co-operation with corresponding international
organisations, namely the UN, the Council of Europe, OSCE and others is therefore
necessary. At present Latvia is not a target for human trafficking from other countries, the
threat internally is mainly the recruitment of young women to be sent to other countries
for the purpose of prostitution. The networks of international organised crime currently
engaged in human trafficking may well broaden their operations and engage in human
trafficking in order to trade in human organs for transplants, and to organise the
immigration of citizens of third countries to be used in forced labour.

Organised crime is branching out, and its representatives carry out activities not only
within the territory of one, but in several countries. Access to information among EU


-----

member countries would ensure the implementation of antiterrorism policy, a process of
migration control and the fight against international organised crime commensurate with
the national interests of each country, as well as the common EU requirements.

There is a risk that Latvia may be used both as an intermediary stage for the illegal trade
of strategically important goods, as well as an area for the illegal distribution and
production of strategically important goods, because the activities of a number of
criminal groupings are linked to the illegal import of goods and other valuables into
Latvia and their distribution within the country.

The threat caused by the distribution of narcotic and psychotropic substances and the
consequences of their use is on the rise. The link between organised criminal groupings
and the illegal circulation of narcotic and psychotropic substances is growing. Latvia is
more and more often used as a transit country for the transport of narcotic and
psychotropic substances to neighbouring countries.

Over recent years there has been a growing trend indicating that economic crimes are of
an international nature, linked to the establishment of transnational contacts among
criminals. Considering the significant and complex threat caused to the national economy
by financial crime, national law enforcement agencies are paying increased attention to
cases of the legalisation of illegally gained funds, as well as the incidences of forged
payment documents.

A separate issue to be addressed is the risk of corruption, which threatens national
development, harms a country’s international prestige and sovereignty, lowers the quality
of life for the population and arouses mistrust of the government and the democratic
system of administration. To avert these negative tendencies, co-operation is necessary
among state institutions, the private sector and the public.

Latvia’s priorities:

-  to pay particular attention to fighting and preventing human trafficking, which most
directly affects the security of Latvia’s population;

-  to counteract the developing trends of organised crime and the attempts to influence
economic processes;

-  to reduce the distribution of narcotic and psychotropic substances in Latvia;

-  to reduce corruption by encouraging public understanding of the necessity to become
involved in the elimination corruption.

_2.8 Environmental risks, prevention of disasters and overcoming same_

As a result of human economic activities, significant global and climate changes are
taking place. Climate change in one location may affect change elsewhere in the world.


-----

Climate change already causes destructive natural disasters, which significantly affect the
security of countries and of whole regions. Climate change is caused by long-term human
activities and it is possible to reduce its negative impact by carrying out deliberate,
targeted long-term activiities. Global climate change has a negative influence on natural
resources and on their future accessibility.

Climate change affects ever more seriously various natural eco-systems, biological
diversity, human health and welfare.

Independently of global climate change, environmental risk exists also in the Baltic Sea
region. In the Baltic Sea and the territorial waters of Latvia, the intensity of shipping
traffic is increasing constantly, and linked to it, the number of shipping accidents. The
Baltic Sea ecosystem is comparatively fragile, and serious shipping accidents near the
coast of the Baltic Sea and in the Gulf of Riga may trigger natural disasters. To prevent
such accidents, Latvia must achieve a higher standard of safety in shipping on an
international level, especially under the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) and
the Helsinki Commission (HELCOM), and must be prepared to bring under control and
clean up sea pollution after any such shipping accidents.

Growing economic activity (for example, the planned construction of the Northern
European gas pipeline) will create a need for added maritime envitonmental monitoring
and additional security measures.

Considering the link between Latvian waterways (especially the Daugava, Lielupe and
Venta) and crossborder pollution, and the risk of high volume pollution transfer from
other countries where industrial disasters are potentially possible and could affect Latvia
causing environmental pollution, it is necessary to develop a high level of security for the
prevention of such disasters and for the protection of waterways.

Radiation accidents are to be considered the most serious, because, as a result of the use
of radioactive material, large territories may be polluted or individual objects and the
civil population may be subjected to radiation impact. It is not possible to eliminate
widespread radioactive pollution over a short period of time, and the anticipated cost of
such clean-up activities may exceed a country’s available resources. International cooperation and the exchange of experience in the prevention of the threat of radioactivity
are of great significance.

Terrorist attacks on sources of ionized radiation of national importance cannot be totally
excluded, nor can acts of terrorism using chemical, radioactive or microbiological agents,
nuclear weapons, the poisoning of water reservoirs, the spraying of dangerous chemical
substances, or the diffusion of poisonous substances in locations where large masses of
people concentrate.

Environmental risk may also be caused by interruptions to the supply of electric power,
as a result of which man-made disasters may occur in establishement at risk of industrial
accident, and the operations of waste water purification plants may also be interrupted.

Potentially, there is a possibility of such technogenic or natural disasters whose
consequences can be likened to the consequences of the means of mass destruction.
Epidemics, epizootics and epiphytics also require a fast and effective reaction to events.

Improvement of the civil defence system is one of the guarantees for the successful
implementation of national security and defence policy. Special attention must be paid to
precisely determining the areas of responsibility and the operations of the relevant state
institutions and local governments, in order to react to emergency situations, in their
prevention, managements and relief of the consequences of emergency situations, and cooperation with the military defence system where the country may be under threat.

Latvia’s priorities:

-  to perfect legislation concerning environmental threat and the management of crisis
situations;

-  to optimise crisis management and civil defence systems;

-  to improve civil and military co-operation, and to increase preparedness in
counteracting crisis situations and environmental disasters;

-  for the relevant institutions to pay particular attention to the forecasting of
environmental disasters and in preparing a scenario for recovery thereof, by appointing
an appropriate group of experts within the Ministry of Environment structure;

-  to enter into the necessary inter-state co-operation agreements on information exchange
in emergency situations;

-  to introduce autonomous electricy supply systems in facilities where an interruption in
the supply of electric power may cause the risk of accident;

-  to encourage the establishment of Latvian national rapid reaction and medical support
units for the provision of international aid.

**Conclusion**

The internal security environment of Latvia is characterised by stability, the permanence
of which is dependent on the potential development of known threats.

Threats to the country’s stability may be caused by an increase in the general crime
situation, issues of safety of the individual, an unstable social protection system, threats
to economic sovereignty, and environmental, regional policy and corruption problems.

The potential threat of international terrorism in the territory of Latvia, and the threat to
residents, members of the NAF and institutions of Latvia abroad must not be overlooked.

There is no direct external threat to Latvia, and there is a comparatively low level of
global threat; however, considering the rapid processes of globalisation, the influence of
these threats on Latvia and its population within the country and beyond its borders could
increase. It is therefore necessary to continue working on the promotion of international
co-operation – consolidating the system of agreements and practical co-operation with
other countries and international organisations.

The following should be considered Latvia’s main priorities of national security:

-  the encouragement of co-operation on foreign policy within the region and within
international organisations, supporting the strengthening of democracy and the
stabilisation of the security of the international environment;

-  within its competence, the development of closer co-operation and a legal framework
with the relevant institutions of the EU and other countries in order to achieve increased
common national security;

-  to enhance the capacity of state security institutions in the area of reconnaissance and
counterintelligence, co-operation with counterpart services in partner countries;

-  the modernisation of the NAF and development of military capability, also the
strengthening of joint NATO military capability;

-  support for international peacekeeping operations, improvement of the efficiency of
available resources, and involvement in the development of an EU common defence and
security policy;

-  the reduction of inflation and the current account deficit; a balanced economic
development;

-  the preparation and implementation of a national energy policy, ensuring diversification
of the energy supply by joining the European energy supply system and developing the
electricity production sector;

-  the consolidation of civic society by encouraging naturalisation, national loyalty and
reducing social stratification; reduction of divisions in education and the information
space;

-  to upgrade and reorganize the protection and control of the national borders in
conformance with the requirements of EU and Schengen Agreements, to develop the
immigration service and control of migration processes within the country;

-  to improve co-operation among state administration institutions, the public and the
armed forces, to rationalise and upgrade the civil defence system. Conclude necessary
mutual agreements and refine the relevant legislation and process of circulation of
information for emergency situations;


-----

-  to improve critical infrastructure, including information and communication technology
infrastructure, to improve the defence system and increase security of high risk objects, to
introduce autonomous electric power supply systems;

-  limit crossborder co-operation between organised crime groupings and attempts to
influence economic processes. Reduce the distribution of narcotic and psychotropic
substances in Latvia. Encourage public understanding of the need for every individual
person to become involved in the prevention of these violations of the law.

The priorities and tasks presented in this Concept form the basis for the activities of state
institutions and an encouragement for mutual co-operation among them in the formation
of a common national security policy for the state and in the elaboration of plans and
programmes for individual sectors.

The principles determined by the National Security Concept must be taken into account
when drawing up new policy planning and programme documents. Based on the
priorities as determined in this Concept, the Cabinet of Ministers shall prepare a National
Security Plan, which will set out next year’s priorities for the improvement of the
situation as regards national security.
