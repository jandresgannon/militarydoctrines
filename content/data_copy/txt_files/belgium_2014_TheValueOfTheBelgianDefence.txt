# “The value of the Belgian Defence”

### Introduction

What is the value of a national defence? What does it cost the state and the Belgian
population, what are the benefi ts and what is the return on investment of a national defence
for society?

Since the fall of the Berlin Wall and the disappearance of the direct link between defence
and the protection of territorial integrity the value of defence in a globalised world has been
questioned. Although we lived in peaceful times during the Cold War the existential threat
during this era justifi ed the means that were inherent to defence. Today, in the absence of
any real territorial threat and in a society that perceives existing security threats as only
indirect, we are less inclined to pay the contribution for the “ultimate defence insurance
policy”, especially in a time when the national budget is becoming ever tighter. In this respect,
the difference between what Belgian citizens are willing to spend on individual insurance
premiums against all kinds of risks and the expenses to cover the collective police and
Defence “protection costs” (a kind of community liability insurance policy) is quite indicative.


In 2011, a Belgian citizen spent an average of €2,650 on insurance policies (life,
accident, health, vehicle, fi re, legal aid, …), €384 on police (€156 on Federal Police
and €228 on local police[i]) and €254 on Defence.[1]


This is made evident by the fact that Defence budgets have been consistently reduced in
Belgium as in most European countries, whereas the new growth poles support their economic
rise with additional investments in Defence. For instance, between 2001 and 2010 defence
expenditure in the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India and China) increased 29.6 %, 82.4 %,
54.3 % and 189 % respectively.[ii]

Belgium lacks a well-established tradition of strategic refl ection and there has never been a
broad societal debate on Defence. This can probably be explained by the fact that Belgian
society is characterised by a deep-seated pacifi sm.[iii] Security, which partly results from more
than 60 years of effi cient transatlantic defence cooperation, is perceived in Belgium today
as an inherent characteristic of our society.

Newspaper “L’avenir” states on 22 June 2013: “only 12 % of our web surfers think it is
“right” to send soldiers to Mali… - Of the 3,602 surfers who gave their opinion on the
sending of 70 Belgian soldiers to Mali, 12 % agree. 54 % of the people polled think
that it is their money that is sent abroad, 34 % think that 70 soldiers are not going to
make a difference.”


The next government will have to decide on the future profi le of the Belgian Armed Forces.
It will have to establish a sound personnel structure and take decisions on future important
weapon systems (fi ghter planes, frigates and mine hunters) of our Belgian armed forces.
These choices will determine the contribution of our Defence to national and global security
for decades to come.

In order to advance the discussion on the role and the missions of Defence and in light of the
ever increasing pressure on the Defence budget, it would be sensible to stress its importance
and to emphasise its economic and non-economic ‘added value’. It is therefore absolutely
necessary to explain the value of Defence in the year 2014, while looking to the future.[iv]

The fi rst chapter of this document compares the ‘costs’ and ‘value’ of
Defence. The second chapter describes the current and future security
environment. In the following chapter the intrinsic value of the Belgian
Defence for the Belgian society is explained, i.e. its contribution to
national security both abroad and at home. The fourth and last chapter
deals with the derived value of the Belgian Defence, focusing on its
direct economic return on investment.

Moreover, Belgian Defence is also at the back of the NATO pack as far as investments in
major equipment are concerned.[v] It is precisely these investments that are necessary to allow
the government to commit Belgian armed forces for deployment in the next decades.

The value of Defence, intrinsic or derived, based on a fi nancial assessment or not, is not
mentioned enough in the public debate. This debate is today almost exclusively focused on
the cost, without taking into consideration the profi t that is gained by society from the fi nancial
investment in Defence.[3]

3 In the Oxford Advanced Learner’s Dictionary “value” is defi ned as “worth of something in terms of money or other goods for which it can
be exchanged”, as “worth of something compared with the price paid for it”, and as “quality of being useful or worthwhile or important”,
refl ecting the complexity of the concept.
The concept of “intrinsic value” is used in the sense of “valuable of/in itself and not for what it can lead to (without further objective)”,
http://www.fi losofi schwoordenboek.nl/content/intrinsiekewaarde.html

### g

The intrinsic value of Defence is the answer to following question: why does our society need
armed forces? This intrinsic value underlies the existence of the military forces.

The intrinsic value of the Belgian Defence is derived from its objective, i.e. contributing to
safeguarding national interests. The main national interests are described in the document
_“Defence Mission Statement and Strategic Framework for Operational Work-up” [vi]:_

-- public security in the broad sense of the term, including public order, stability, peace and
security, health;

-- socioeconomic prosperity in a macroeconomic and stable monetary environment;
-- standard of living;
-- national sovereignty;
-- protection of our values (such as democracy, human rights, …);
-- preservation of a voice in a multinational forum;
-- national territorial integrity.

The intrinsic value of the Belgian Defence is difficult to determine for many reasons. In a
globalised world with intertwined national interests the appraisal of Defence is not singularly
connected to one specific interest of one specific country. However, it can be stated that
national interests generally revolve around three key concepts: prosperity, well-being and
security, the last one being an essential condition to preserve our prosperity and our wellbeing. Moreover, the concept ‘security’ is in itself very subjective. The perceived security does
not necessarily correspond to the actual security.

### Derived value of the Belgian Defence

The derived value is subordinate to the intrinsic value, since the derived value is a by-product
of the organisation of Defence at the service of the security of the citizens and of the state.
The derived value of a sizable organisation such as Defence is measured by the spin-offs for
the benefit of the Belgian society: employment, contracts, research and development, etc.
However, this derived value is gaining importance as nowadays Defence is viewed mostly
from a financial perspective.

# Chapter 2:
### Current and future security environment

Over the following pages we take a closer look at the current and future security environment.
This chapter provides the framework that is necessary to understand the link between security,
well-being, and prosperity, and the execution of military operations that often take place far
away from our country.

#### A fundamentally changed global security environment

After the fall of the Berlin Wall the world changed from a relatively simple bipolar system into a
complex hard-to-fathom multipolar world. The importance of non-state actors in security matters
has grown considerably. In this respect terrorist groups, for instance, have played a major role
in a number of recent confl icts. More and more non-state security providers appear in confl ict
areas, especially commercially-oriented private military companies acting, or not, on behalf of
national authorities. Yet the state remains the main actor in international relations.

States are increasingly faced with cross-border threats such as terrorism, international crime, and
security problems, on occasions, related to the internet, some forms of which are supported or
even organised by state actors.[vii]

Besides that, the growing interdependence of the global economy, the access to and the rapid
evolution of technology, as well as the impact of new communication media have resulted in
an intensifi cation of globalisation. Today it is of crucial importance to secure the global fl ows of
goods and information upon which our open economy and society are based.[viii]

These new dimensions denote the cross-border and holistic nature of security, in which aspects
such as “economic security” and “cyber security”[4] also have to be incorporated into a broader
approach to security.[ix] External (international) security and internal (societal) security are overlapping more and more.

A strictly national and territorial approach to security, a view still held by our society, has become
increasingly irrelevant. Now, more than ever before, we need international cooperation as well
as a multidisciplinary and integrated approach to security issues.

4 Over the past three years the internet has accounted in Belgium for 25 % of growth in GDP (and 15 % in employment) coming in particular through growth export (Jacques Bughin et al, Internet matters: The transforming power of the Internet economy in Belgium. McKinsey
Global Institute, November 2011, p. 5).

### p, g y

Besides the security environment set out above, in a European and Belgian context a number
of additional events and trends have to be taken into account.


Western Europe has not been faced with major inter-state conflicts since World War II. The
peace dividend realised in these countries (including Belgium) since 1989 has resulted in a
re-sizing and re-orienting of the armed forces, the most obvious consequence of which is the
fact that compulsory military service has been abolished or suspended in most countries. As a
country Belgium has known peace for more than sixty years now. In our globalised world the
focus of military commitment that used to be territorial has shifted to expeditionary interventions
in order to reduce spill-over effects of security issues anywhere else in the world as much as
possible. By acting preventively Belgium ensures that state and security structures are solid
enough. For historical reasons Belgium maintains special relations with Central Africa, where
Defence has repeatedly offered its support. Together with its international partners Belgium has
for example also intervened militarily in Europe and its periphery during the Balkan conflicts
in the 1990s, in the Lebanon since 2006, in Libya in 2011, in Mali in 2013 as well as in
Afghanistan after the events of 9/11 and in the Indian Ocean since 2009.

capacities[5], has often been decisive for the success of these military interventions. But
since 2012 the United States has gradually shifted its geopolitical focus to the Far East. As
a result, Europe will be less able to count on American military capabilities to safeguard
(former) common interests in Europe and its periphery. With growing ethnic diversity Belgium
and other European countries run the risk of experiencing secondary effects of prolonged
international crises on their territory. These effects concern security, prosperity and wellbeing, and include terrorist actions, refugee issues, polarisation of ethnic and religious
communities, etc. As a consequence, just when Europe needs to act more independently
when handling security issues at its borders, defence budgets in most EU member states
are even further reduced due to the ongoing economic crisis and the rising costs of an
ageing population.

Whereas defence budgets in other parts of the world, especially in Asia, show a rising trend,
in Europe everything seems to indicate that the military will be further cut back, without having
a sound defence policy to mitigate the consequences of this downsizing within a EU strategic
vision framework.[x]

The security environment has become more uncertain and more complex, and is
evolving very rapidly. External and internal security are interacting more and more.
The concept of security is going through a radical development, in which “extension”
and “interdependence” are the key words. The extent to which Europe and especially
Belgium will be able to guarantee security shall largely depend on the effectiveness of
a multilateral approach.[xii]

# Chapter 3:
### The intrinsic value of the Belgian Defence

 Introduction

The Belgian Defence’s intrinsic value is refl ected in its contribution to national security in
order to preserve our country’s national interests. This contribution is demonstrated by a wide
variety of activities which can be defi ned as strategic missions[xiii]:

- participating in collective defence, including operations to prevent and deter armed attacks
against one or more NATO or EU countries;
- participating in the collective protection of NATO’s and/or the EU’s vital and essential
interests;
- protecting fellow citizens or Belgian interests abroad, including the liberation and evacuation
of Belgian nationals;
- taking part in security operations, peace-keeping and peace-enforcement in order to prevent
the violation of the international rule of law and security or to restore and maintain them;
- taking part in humanitarian operations in order to relieve human suffering;
- contributing to the security of Belgian society within national boundaries, based on specifi c
military expertise or capabilities, or whenever civilian means are insuffi cient.

The value of some of these military activities is readily apparent and rather obvious. Just think
of explosive ordnance disposal or maritime search and rescue. These operations, taking
place on Belgian territory, have a high visibility and are easy to quantify.

This does not apply to all activities carried out by the Defence Forces in Belgium. Reasons for
this include the fact that some actions are carried out in support of other public services while
others, such as the fi ght against terrorism or cyber-attacks, are subject to some confi dentiality.

But it is even harder to establish the value of missions carried out by Defence outside the
national boundaries as they are part of a much larger multidisciplinary and multilateral
approach to security issues. Whether or not a security situation is dealt with successfully
through the use of military means, depends on both the military action and the act of involving
other players and public means such as diplomacy, development cooperation and NGOs.
Assignments performed by Defence within this context are of course less visible and harder to
isolate, and cannot be quantifi ed quite as easily. Besides, they have a rather indirect impact
on the security of Belgian society.

###### Expanding the concept of “preservation of territorial integrity”

The acquisition of means and the commitments made by Defence in connection with the
preservation of territorial integrity are still often seen from a mainly national territorial point
of view by the Belgian public opinion. Today, in a strongly evolved security environment,
the interpretation of “preservation of territorial integrity” needs to be widened. Its policy
of neutrality having failed twice, Belgium decided, after the Second World War, to join
NATO and act as a defender of the European integration process. Our country turned
to multilateralism through the NATO Treaty Article 5 and the mutual assistance clause of
the EU Lisbon Treaty, in order to preserve its territorial integrity. This has made territorial
integrity a collective responsibility, a collective “life insurance”. As a result, Belgium is jointly
responsible for preserving the territorial integrity of the entire NATO and EU territory. Clearly,
the value offered by the Belgian Defence must be placed in the context of this expanded
interpretation that requires a proportional participation by all member states. ‘Assuring’
this integrity remains the most important added value Defence has to offer to our nation. Its
major contribution consists of deterring potential opponents through the Alliance. This mission
however seems to have become the victim of its own success. An effective deterrence policy
not being readily visible, such contribution often gets little attention and/or is misjudged as
to its true value by Belgians. Besides, Belgium’s perception of the security landscape is not
shared by all its partners. The absence of a real territorial threat is viewed very differently by
the countries of Eastern Europe.

###### A stable global security environment is essential for Belgium

Although the Belgian borders are not threatened, it is in our interest to maintain peace, stability
and security in the broadest sense, worldwide and especially in our immediate European
neighbourhood. Within the framework of Belgium’s foreign policy, different resources such
as economy, diplomacy, defence as well as development cooperation are used separately
or in combination with each other, enabling our country to protect its national interests. The
various contributions made by the Belgian Defence include humanitarian, peace-support, up
to peace-enforcement operations. In the past ten years, there has been an annual average
of 1,000 full-time posts in operations worldwide, most of the time in cooperation with other
international partners (as shown in the following chart).

Belgium has one of the most open economies in the world. Our country ranks fifth among the
world’s most globalized economies[xiv] and occupies the 17[th] position in the world ranking with
a GDP of $483.7 billion in 2012. It is the 10[th] largest exporting and 12[th] largest importing
country worldwide, with a total value of respectively $476 and $461 billion.[xv] The port of
Antwerp is the second port of Europe and we have the 19th largest merchant fleet (in terms
of tonnage) in the world.[xvi]


Compared to other countries, Belgium is indeed deeply embedded in the globalized world.
Its prosperity and high standard of living largely depend on a safe ‘open world’.

It is therefore in our country’s best interest to make a military contribution to the free movement
of goods worldwide, in proportion to the importance of its national maritime trade interests.
Protecting our mainly maritime supply routes which are the vital arteries of our national
economy, is therefore essential.


In 2012, the seaborne trade between Belgium and the Far East, the Indian subcontinent and
the Persian Gulf amounted to $54.9 billion.[xvii] In the same year, the Port of Antwerp realised a
turnover of 25.5 million tonnes of goods with the Far East and Indian subcontinent regions.[xviii]
Regarding energy resources, 27 % of crude oil and 14 % of natural gas imports in Belgium
come from the Persian Gulf (Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Iran and Qatar)[xix] through the Indian Ocean.
The national economy depends to a large extent on safe maritime transport in this distant
region. According to a 2013 World Bank report, the annual cost of Somali piracy in the
Indian Ocean is estimated at $18 billion.[xx]

By taking part in EU Operation ATALANTA in the fight against piracy in the Indian Ocean and
EUTM (European Union Training Mission) Somalia, Belgium contributes to global economic
security through the protection of its economically vital shipping routes in this region.


In April 2009, the Pompei,
a side stone dumping vessel
belonging to the Belgian
dredging company “Jan De
Nul Group”, was hijacked by
Somali pirates. According to
media reports, the ship and
its crew were released after
the company had paid
€2.8 million ransom.[xxi]


-----

The Belgian Navy frigate Louise-Marie has taken part three times in EU Operation Atalanta for the fight against piracy.

###### The Belgian society in a globalized world


Some foreign countries are devastated by civil wars, have weak state structures, do not
or barely enjoy democracy, are economically less developed or are in a quite vulnerable
situation as regards security and human rights. These regions are a fertile breeding ground for
cross-border security issues such as terrorism, extremism, mass immigration and international
crime (human trafficking, prostitution, drug and arms trafficking). Globally, failed and failing
states represent an economic cost of $270 billion of which the neighbouring countries bear
87 %.[xxii] But also more distant countries like Belgium are faced with costs related to the
economy, crime, migration, drugs and terrorism which are hard to quantify.


The budgets of both the, Federal Agency for the Reception of Asylum-Seekers[6] and the

but not always – far from the European continent, can have implications for Belgian society,
whether we like it or not. It is therefore in our country’s interest to contribute to the quick
restoration of security and prosperity in certain regions.

In this context, the Belgian Defence has taken part in multilateral expeditionary operations
in the Balkans, Libya, the Middle East, Afghanistan, Central Africa and the Sahel. In this
way, it has helped enhance security in those countries and regions, allowing the rebuilding
of local communities. This indirectly results in the local population being less inclined to flee
the country, reducing the flow of refugees to Europe and Belgium.

Albalodge: the construction of refugee camps in Albania in order to receive Kosovar refugees.


In the summer of 1999, as a result of the Kosovar conflict, the Belgian
public social welfare centres[8] were literally stormed by a massive influx of
refugees. The situation in cities such as Ghent or Antwerp was described as a
disaster.[xxiv] Refugees were granted the temporary status of “expatriates”,
making improved security in Kosovo a precondition for their return. The
UNHCR, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees,
waited for the KFOR, a UN peace-keeping force of 40,000 men, to be
fully deployed before sending back the refugees. Moreover, a sufficiently
large number of mines had to be marked and dismantled by the KFOR first.
In March 2000 both conditions were met thanks to the deployment of –
also Belgian – ground troops. Every day, four planes from several European
countries brought returning refugees back to Pristina.

becoming increasingly more like paramilitary organizations, using weapons of war and
sophisticated equipment such as small submarines. The Belgian Defence regularly sends
a frigate or a helicopter on a Dutch Navy ship in support of the international fight against
drug trafficking in this area which contributes to reducing the presence of drugs in our
streets.

In the spring of 2013, the Dutch Navy ship Friesland, assisted by a Belgian Alouette III helicopter, intercepted more
than 3 tonnes of drugs in the Caribbean Sea within the framework of the international anti-drug operation Martillo.


###### Belgium’s position at the international level

Belgium is a founding member of the United Nations (UN), the North Atlantic Treaty
Organisation (NATO) and the European Union (EU), the three major international security
organizations. Our country is also a member of the OSCE (Organisation for Security and
Cooperation in Europe). We often play a leading role in these organizations. Our country
held the presidency of both the OSCE in 2006 and the EU Council during the second half of


-----

the Security Council of the United Nations.

Belgian seat on the
UN Security Council.

We are one of the 10 most frequent non-permanent members.[xxvi] This position and the
willingness to play a leading role within these organizations affect Belgium’s foreign policy
and portray a positive image of our country. Playing a leadership role however entails some
responsibilities. Belgium’s international profile and standing compel it to fulfil its commitment
and strengthen its position as a credible and responsible member of these international
organisations. The credibility of this membership is connected with the burden and risks taken
on by Belgian Defence when contributing to international security in a multilateral context,
commonly known as “burden & risk sharing”. Deploying its military means, allows Belgium
to demonstrate its intention to act and to use its influence on the international scene which, in
conjunction with other levers of power in the fields of economy, diplomacy and cooperation
development, will contribute to the protection of its national interests.

By making an equitable defence contribution, member countries of an alliance avoid being
seen as free riders or profiteers. A negative image can indeed lead to a decline in political
influence and in economic opportunities at international level. Unlike large countries whose
weight is in proportion to their vast territory, the size of their population and/or the presence
of raw materials and energy resources, small countries whose economy depends on other
countries definitely need to develop a solid reputation on the international scene.

In any case, given the position of a country like Belgium, being one of the top economies in the
world entails obligations towards the international community. Through Defence commitments,
Belgium can meet its responsibilities by contributing, in a reasonable and proportional way,
to increased stability in the global security environment.

Ensuring the security of Belgian citizens abroad is one of our most tangible interests. Whenever
the host state is unable to guarantee the security of Belgian citizens and embassy staff abroad,
it is the responsibility of the Belgian State to protect them by deploying military means and,
if necessary, to plan a Non-combatant Evacuation Operation (NEO).

### Internal dimension of national security

Ensuring a population’s security (in the broadest sense) on the national territory is an obligation
and a responsibility of state authorities.

Unlike the preservation of the country’s territorial integrity, discussed earlier in this chapter,
ensuring security within the national borders is mainly entrusted to authorities other than
Defence. Having unique expertise and making targeted investments, Defence nevertheless
takes on several clearly-defined and important assignments in close coordination with these
other actors. Defence will also carry out tasks when civilian means are insufficient. As internal
and external security become increasingly intertwined, a growing coordination is needed at
both national and international level (e.g. with regard to the cyber domain) in order to take
effective action.

This document is not intended to be an exhaustive list of all Defence activities performed
by the land, air, naval and medical components on Belgian territory. Only the most
characteristic activities are mentioned with their quantitative and/or qualitative value
expressed in figures.

Two F-16s are on stand-by day and night within the framework of the Quick Reaction Alert (QRA). The economic cost related to the closure
of Belgian air space during one day as a result of a Renegade incident is estimated at €24 million.[xxviii]

To prevent civilian planes from being used as terrorist weapons in Belgian air space, two
armed F-16 fighter planes are on 24-hour stand-by (Renegade). The planes are also used to
secure NATO’s air space against military planes (QRA – Quick Reaction Alert). The fact that
Belgium has never been hit by a terrorist air attack, does not mean Operation Renegade is
any less valuable. The absence of a rapid response capability, guaranteeing the security of
the Belgian air space, can bring about its precautionary closure. The direct economic cost of
such closure would amount to €24 million and that is without mentioning the indirect economic
costs, especially with regard to the impact on a state’s reputation. Belgium’s inability to offer
such “insurance policy” could actually lead to a loss of attractiveness for foreign investors.
Besides, Belgium being the host country of some major international institutions, particular
attention should be paid to securing their headquarters.

Not a day passes without the Explosive Ordnance Disposal Service[9] being called with
regard to munitions of war or explosives. Since 1973, the service has been receiving about
3,000 requests for Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) a year, which amounts to an almost
constant annual average of 200 to 300 tonnes of explosives. Part of these explosives contain
toxic materials and are dismantled in Poelkapelle. Over the last ten years, the service has
also received an annual average of 139 intervention requests with regard to Improvised
Explosive Devices (IED) (including bomb scares). This shows that SEDEE’s interventions do
not only concern explosive ordnance from the previous world wars but also actions in the
fight against crime and terrorism.

Maritime security in the territorial sea and exclusive economic zone is the responsibility of the
Belgian State. As regards this 3,600 km[2] large area, being bigger than the Province of WestFlanders and sometimes referred to as Belgium’s eleventh province, the security dimension
covers many different, partly overlapping, fields like maritime security, maintenance of law
and order at sea, services to shipping and search and rescue coordination. Being in charge
of maritime security, Defence lends its support to 16 other federal, regional and provincial authorities in other areas of competence. As a result of the division of competences with regard
to maritime security and the permeability of sea borders, Defence’s contribution to security falls,
naturally enough, within an interdepartmental and international framework.[xxix]

In 2012, for example, the interventions and contributions by Defence included:


-- monitoring and reporting of more than 2,000 specific ships (Contacts of Interest) for the
Coast Guard partners (among others the Federal Police and Customs), security services
and NATO;

-- detection and reporting of suspicious behaviour at sea, including 20 intrusions in wind
farms;

-- 12 detections and investigations with regard to marine oil pollution;
-- detection and identification of violations of the navigation rules, collisions and sunken ships;
-- tracking of fishing vessels for the Coast Guard partners;
-- search and rescue at sea and explosive ordnance disposal (see below).


The resources deployed by Defence to perform these tasks include the Maritime Information
Centre (MIC)[10], Ready Duty Ships (RDS), mine countermeasures vessels, SAR (Search and
Rescue) helicopters as well as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV).

Since 1977, the 40th Squadron Koksijde has performed more
than 3,000 scrambles, resulting in the saving of 1,668 human lives.

in the North Sea be activated, Defence also provides means of Command and Control for
conducting state actions at sea (on scene commander and coordinator in charge of antipollution resources at sea).

The Seaking helicopters, to be replaced shortly by NH-90s, support both maritime and – in
case of aircraft accidents – land rescue operations for the benefi t of Belgian society. It is
important to remember that maritime security is the concern of various departments. The
Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre (MRCC) in Ostend, which comes under the authority
of the Flemish Region, uses military dual-use means. Although the primary role of an NH-90
(NFH – NATO Frigate Helicopter) is to carry out maritime operations from a frigate, four
NH-90 helicopters can also be deployed for rescue operations with the view of optimizing
Defence capability.

Defence’s operations at sea also include the removal of ammunition that is regularly found
aboard fi shing boats and (suction) dredgers. After the death of three people due to the
explosion of an air bomb caught by a Dutch fi shing boat in 2005, Operation Benefi cial
Cooperation was launched. This Belgian-Dutch operation is charged with removing and
destroying explosive ordnance from the previous world wars lying along the Belgian and
Dutch coasts and the exclusive economic zone of Great Britain (see chart below). Standing
NATO Mine Counter Measures Group one (SNMCMG1) regularly takes part in this on-going
operation.

Keeping our ports open and the fl ow of maritime trade going are essential for our
economy. Given the direct added value of €16.5 billion produced by the ports of
Antwerp, Ghent, Liège, Zeebrugge, Brussels and Ostend in 2011, closing these ports
would cost the Belgian economy some €45 million a day. The ports create 115,600
full-time direct jobs.[xxx] Sea mines, whether or not laid by terrorists in waterways leading
to these ports, would therefore have a huge impact on the Belgian (and Western
European) economy. Developing our own mine countermeasures capability and signing
cooperation agreements with privileged partners make it possible to minimize such risk.

to external security. During its participations in the EU anti-piracy operation (Operation
ATALANTA) in 2011, 2012 and 2013, the frigate Louise-Marie could always turn to the
Maritime Information Centre (CIM) for the rapid transmission of information on Belgian
merchant ships sailing nearby.

###### Support to the “Integrated Police” operations


Defence also provides non-structural, targeted and temporary support to operations of the
“Integrated Police”. It provides equipment, infrastructure and specialized teams, such as dog
handlers and divers.
This includes:

-- support to securing EU and NATO meetings (mine clearance, medical capacities);
-- search for missing persons or weapons, within the framework of a criminal investigation;
-- surveillance of parliamentary institutions and close protection of authorities.


The cost incurred by the
surveillance of parliamentary
institutions amounted to
€4.5 million in 2012.

###### Support to the Nation in the field of intelligence

Defence contributes to the security of Belgian society in cooperation with various departments
of the Belgian State, international organizations and allied intelligence departments. This
contribution being confidential, it is also less visible. In Belgium, these departments are
the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Home Affairs and Justice, the State Security, the Threat
Assessment Coordination Body[12], the Federal Police and the Financial Intelligence Processing
Unit[13]. Practically speaking, the Defence Intelligence Service[14] makes a crucial contribution

cyber threats. This contribution also encompasses the protection of Belgium’s scientifi c and
economic resources.

###### Medical support to the Nation


Medical support given by the Defence medical component is focused on the preparation
of deployable and deployed personnel, as well as towards healthcare support to troops
in operation. But the medical component is also directly involved in a substantial way in
healthcare to the Belgian population. Uncommitted means are used for specialized care to
the population in daily life as well as in a crisis situation, or after a natural disaster.

This includes the availability of:

- the burn center of the military hospital in Neder-over-Heembeek as the only Belgian day
clinic for burnt patients, with 26 beds and a specialized consultation (more than 10,000
contacts on a yearly basis). In the private sector, this type of care would cost €20.7 million;[15]

- the center of hyperbaric medicine and oxygen therapy, complementing the private medical
sector, for carbon monoxide poisoning, chronic wounds, serious infectious diseases and, last
but not least, diving accidents. The military hospital is the only one in the Brussels-Capital
region with a hyperbaric multi-place chamber. Between 600 and 1,000 patients can be
admitted every year;


The military hospital: 36 % of the overall Belgian capacity with 72 beds for burned patients.

15 Every year, Defence receives about €13.8 million in services for third parties from the Belgian social security and insurance companies
for providing this highly specialized service.

military hospital, each dealing with about 2,000 interventions among the civil population
in the Brussels-Capital region and the Province of Flemish Brabant;

- the military hospital as a whole in the case of disasters such as the gas explosion in
Ghislenghien, the train accident in Halle-Buizingen and the bus accident in Sierre
(Switzerland);

- a production unit for mass production of medication in case of pandemics or nuclear
accidents. This includes OSELTAMIVIR, an antiviral medication prescribed in the context of
the Belgian emergency plan during infl uenza epidemics and the potassium iodide pills in
case of a nuclear disaster, for the Federal Public Service Health, Food Chain Safety and
Environment.

The manufacturing of antiviral products by the medication production department
of the 5th Medical Intervention Element (5 EMI) in Nivelles.


The value of the specialized military medical capacities also relies on good integration within
the Belgian medical landscape. The pooling and sharing of capacities and the development
of partnerships conform to a functional and economic model that avoids redundancies and
competition.

Defence provides personnel, equipment, infrastructure and expertise on a regular basis to
other Public Federal Services, including Federal Police, Civil Protection and Customs, to fulfi l
tasks in the fi eld of crisis and disaster management on Belgian territory. Most of these tasks at
the service of the population are security-related. Defence only gets involved when all other
means prove to be insuffi cient due to the magnitude of the event or the specifi c nature of the
required expertise. Civil emergency services were supported by thousands of soldiers during
the 2010 fl oods on the Belgian territory.

May 2013 – Wetteren-Schellebelle – Chemicals are spreading out after the derailment of a

# Chapter 4:
### The derived value of the Belgian Defence

Aside from its intrinsic value, an organization with the size and the characteristics of
Defence has an undeniable derived value to Belgian society. This derived value accounts
for an economic return. It also plays a role in areas such as scientifi c research and nature
conservation.

### Economic return of Belgian Defence

###### Employment

Defence offers 30,000 direct jobs for military personnel and 2,000 for civilians. There is a
very wide range of jobs offered, from very skilled to unskilled labour.


The Air Base of Florennes is the biggest employer in the Province of Namur with 1,291
workers at the end of 2010, fulfi lling no less than 70 different professions, ranging from
administrative to highly technological functions.[xxxi]

With 5,230 workers, Defence is the biggest employer in the Province of Limburg,
before the Virga Jesse hospital.[xxxii]


Belgium has managed to embed the presence of international institutions headquarters,
such as NATO or the EU, on its territory throughout the years. The support of Belgian
Defence contributes to this anchorage. Both organizations based important international
military headquarters in our country. This applies to the NATO General Headquarters in
Evere, the NATO Strategic Command (SHAPE) at Casteau, the EU Military Staff and the
European Defence Agency (EDA) in Brussels. In addition to the economic spin-offs, such as
the consumption of goods and services, these headquarters also provide jobs for the Belgian
population.

1,598 servicemen returned to the civilian labour market between 2006 and 2012. In
addition to a qualitative and continuous training in the military institutions, they accumulated
professional experience within Defence, often under diffi cult circumstances on operations.
409 servicemen were transferred to other Public Federal Services during that same period.
Feedback from their employers in the private and public sector shows how much the
qualifi cations, skills and abilities acquired within the Belgian Defence are appreciated. These
former servicemen are loyal, disciplined, organized and fl exible. They possess planning and
social abilities, a language and technical background, etc.[xxxiii]


-----

Belgian companies generate a significant percentage of their business turnover from Defence,
through various (sub)systems maintenance contracts and spare parts supply. The Belgian
Defence signed contracts with national firms for more than €950 million between 2010 and
2012.

Today, the impact of the acquisition of the F-16 in 1975 remains significant for Belgian
companies in all three regions. Participating Belgian companies have forged lasting business
relationships with the other European partners and several American firms. Therefore, our
companies were able to open up new markets and participate in the modernization and the
delivery of spare parts for foreign F-16s. The F-16 contract enabled our people to build up
technical and organizational skills. This facilitated the positioning and the selection of Belgian
companies for the development, manufacturing and the after-sales services for spare-parts
and equipment of Airbus airplanes and Ariane rockets.


SABCA ensures the maintenance of the Belgian F-16 and United States Air Force (USAF) planes stationed in Europe (USAFE).

The A400M contract between the Belgian Defence and the ‘‘Airbus Military Sociedad
Limitada (AMSL)’’ also enabled an equitable share of costs and labour, offering Belgium a
return on investment for the purchase of seven A400M transport aircraft. The ‘work-share’ of
Belgian companies exceeds €500 million, mainly under the association between Flabel and
Pratt & Whitney Belgium Engine Center (PWBEC).


-----

A400M - work-share for Belgian companies: landing gear doors, leading edges, fl ap supports and fl ap skins.

Defence signed an open contract with a Belgian maritime fi rm for the availability of nearly
120 experienced civilian technicians and other skilled personnel to the logistic units of
the Navy. They are responsible for specifi c maintenance tasks of the vessels, on board
and ashore. Within the framework of the Belgian-Dutch cooperation[17] between the Navies,
technicians of this fi rm maintain 6 Dutch mine hunters in addition to the 5 Belgian mine
hunters and the patrol ships in Zeebrugge.


From an industry point of view, the derived value of Defence is tangible at various levels. The
value can directly benefi t the community through employment and manufacturing. Equally
important is the indirect value generated by the acquisition of new cutting-edge technology
expertise, research, access to other markets and positioning of Belgian companies.

The Royal Military Academy (Brussels) engages in scientific research in niche areas that are
essential for the Belgian Defence. However, specific applications can be used in non-military
fields for the benefit of Belgian society.


The laboratory of the department of weapon systems and ballistics at the Royal Military
Academy is certified under ISO17025 for strength tests on glass structures with various
items (bullets, gravel, birds). In this context, the laboratory is performing some tests for
the ballistic analysis of the Federal Police, as well as for “third parties”, such as the
Belgian glass manufacturer AGC Glass Europe (former Glaverbel).

for almost 30 years with the oceanographic research vessel Belgica. Over this period, 500
researchers have embarked on the vessel. Together they totalize 67,000 hours spread
over 852 scientific campaigns, mostly in support of the Public Institute for Agricultural and
Fishery research[18], the Management Unit of North Sea and Scheldt Mathematical Models
(MUMM)[xxxiv] and Belgian universities. The five main research fields pertain to geology,
environmental monitoring, fishing, ecosystems and education.

### Nature conservation

Military training areas are often highly valued from an environmental perspective. They owe
their great biodiversity to the absence of inhabited areas and areas of intense cultivation.
Defence signed a cooperation agreement with the Wildlife and Forestry Department[19] in
Wallonia, and with the Nature and Forest Agency[20] in Flanders. These agreements aim at a
better management of nature and forests in over 17,600 hectares of military domains.

With its 1,571 hectares, the Groot Schietveld of Brasschaat forms the biggest nature reserve in the Province of Antwerp after the Kalmthoutse Heide. It is mainly known for its important population of vipers, as it is one of the largest ones in North-Western Europe. It also
hosts more than 100 species of breeding birds, among which the honey buzzard and the nightjar.[xxxv]

# To conclude

Our national interests can be captured in three words: security, well-being and prosperity.
These inseparable values are the cornerstone of Western and Belgian society, with security as
a prerequisite for our well-being and prosperity. In a dynamic and rapidly evolving security
environment, the State role in guaranteeing national security has changed in a similar way.
An interdepartmental and multilateral approach has become an absolute prerequisite to
increase effi ciency and effectiveness. The contribution made by Defence can only be assessed
in this manner. However, a multilateral intervention does not always fully guarantee the
preservation of national interests. This is why a country such as Belgium also needs its own
military capacities. The effort made by Defence has to be tailored according to the need
to maintain the government’s fl exibility in dealing with security problems on the one hand,
and the need to adopt a proactive and constructive attitude while supporting the multilateral
approach on the other.

Defence’s intrinsic value as a security provider to society goes far beyond a simple accounting
exercise expressed in euros. This document has explained how, together with other authorities,
Defence contributes to the security of Belgian society, both at home and abroad.


The intrinsic value of Defence consists in contributing to security, and thus to the wellbeing and prosperity of Belgian society in a globalized world.


While remaining subordinated to the intrinsic value, Defence also has an important derived
value for the country. This derived value mainly manifests itself as direct Defence economic
spin-offs for the benefi t of Belgian society.

In times of fi nancial austerity, Belgian Defence has to show the population what it can offer.
It should not be perceived as a Department that lends itself to easy but short sighted savings
as this would affect our future prosperity and well-being. We must carefully consider the price
our society is willing to pay for its security in order to guarantee national interests that are
increasingly anchored in a European context.

This document wants to clarify the value of our Defence in a complex globalized world and
demonstrate its contribution to a prosperous Belgian society, to the maintenance of national
sovereignty and our international position.
