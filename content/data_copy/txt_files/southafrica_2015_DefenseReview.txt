# South African Defence Review 2015


-----

##### Cabinet Statement: 20 March 2014

Cabinet approved the South African Defence Review, and directed that it be
tabled in Parliament.

The Review provides a long-term Defence Policy and Defence Strategic
Trajectory to be pursued by the country over the next four Medium-Term
Strategic Framework periods.

The document will be shared with the public, as they participated in the
public consultations that were held across the country in the past year.


##### STATE OF THE NATION ADDRESS: 17 June 2014

The South African National Defence Force (SANDF) has been a source of national pride
as it participated in peacekeeping missions on the continent.

This role will continue and government is looking into the resourcing of the SANDF
mandate in line with the recently concluded Defence Review.

To take this programme of action forward, the Deputy President and I will be meeting
with Ministers and Deputy Ministers to discuss the detailed implementation plans for
each department.

Each Minister will sign a performance agreement with the President outlining what each
department will do to deliver on the programme of action.

### FOREWORD BY THE MINISTER OF     DEFENCE & MILITARY VETERANS

It gives me great pleasure and pride to present the South African
Defence Review 2015 to the President of the Republic of South
Africa, the Honourable Jacob Zuma. A dedicated team of proud
South Africans spent extensive time and energy to produce this
important and overdue Defence Review, with utmost dedication and sublime professionalism.

This Defence Review is the second such policy review in the
democratic South Africa, and it maps out the direction defence
will be taking over the next 20 to 30 years. The issues that
informed the 1996 White Paper on Defence and subsequently
the 1998 Defence Review, centred on the transition to democracy and the resultant transformation of the Department of
Defence. However, complex changes in the strategic environment, increasing continental peacekeeping obligations, the need
to deepen democracy on the continent and the pursuit of our
national interests have led to a review of our strategic posture
and concomitant policy.

In an ever-changing and dynamic geopolitical environment, it is
important for the government to ensure that its Defence Force
is not only the Defence Force that South Africa needs, but also
the Defence Force that the citizens want and can be proud of.


The Defence Review Committee, after extensive basic research, provided a draft which was publicly released on 12 April
2012. Starting with a briefing to the Portfolio Committee on
Defence and Military Veterans on 18 April 2012, the Defence
Review Committee proceeded with a consultation process
throughout South Africa.

Over 350 consultative engagements were undertaken with
Ministries, Government Departments, Agencies and Public
Entities, key stakeholders and interested parties. One primary
stakeholder was the Defence Force itself. Many organisations
and experts were engaged internationally, such as the African
Union Commission and the Southern African Development
Community Secretariat. Contributions were received from all
walks of life in South Africa, ranging from rural communities at
grass-roots level to academics and military specialists in and outside South Africa.


_The Minister of Defence & Military Veterans, the Honourable_
_Ms Nosiviwe Noluthando Mapisa-Nqakula._

These engagements enabled the Defence Review Committee
to draw on a breadth of expertise, as well as to engage with
views from a cross-section of the South African society to assist
in pronouncing on the defence policy of South Africa and on
what South Africans expect from their Defence Force. Following public consultation, and the consolidation thereof into the
Defence Review, the document had to be further adapted in
response to the ever-changing strategic environment, especially
on the African continent.


-----

Following engagements at Cabinet level, the Commanderin-Chief, the Honourable President Jacob Zuma, personally
provided additional strategic direction on South Africa’s future
defence capabilities. He further instructed that the ‘defence
strategic trajectory’ be included in the document.

This defence strategic trajectory is the pivotal chapter in the
Defence Review. Departing from an acknowledgement of the
currently declining state of defence capabilities, it posits the desired end-state of the Defence Force, and identifies the 20year defence strategy to be pursued over four Medium-Term
Strategic Framework periods. This strategy is founded on five
milestones, each milestone specifying an estimated budget requirement, personnel targets, the required number of operational units, required capital programmes, and organisational
interventions to be pursued. It further provides strategic guidelines for the development of SA Army, SA Air Force, SA Navy,
SA Military Health Service and SA Special Forces capabilities.

Cabinet has endorsed the Defence Review 2015, and it has
further been tabled in Parliament. I can therefore say that this


document is truly a product for all South Africans by all South
Africans.

Guided by the Defence Review 2015, the Chief of the Defence
Force will present the Military Strategy to the Minister and Cabinet, this being inclusive of: force design; force structure; establishment table; capability strategy and acquisition plan; and key
resource imperatives. The Defence Accounting Officer must
translate the Defence Review into an extended long-term defence development plan, inclusive of an aligned funding trajectory, and integrate this into the government planning cycle.

##### I N T R O D U C T I O N

## CHAIRPERSON’S OVERVIEW

###### ABOUT THE DEFENCE REVIEW

1. The Minister of Defence and Military Veterans constituted
the Defence Review Committee and mandated it to look critically at South Africa’s defence policy, given the rapid and fundamental changes that have occurred in the strategic environment over the last number of years. To this end, the Committee
embarked on a diagnostic of the current defence function and
analysed the strategic role that the Defence Force plays.

2. Whilst a number of the principles established during the
1998 Defence Review process remain relevant, current strategic circumstances call for a far greater Defence contribution
towards the continuance of South Africa’s national security, the
deepening of democracy on the continent and meeting South
Africa’s international responsibilities. This Defence Review thus
defines and expands on the guiding principles that will steer the
Defence Force through the next twenty to thirty years.


3. Traditionally, Defence Forces have focused purely on the
role that they play in the defence of the sovereignty of the nation-state. This Defence Review, however, discusses the broader role of the Defence Force within a developmental state. It
does not purely focus on the ‘what the Defence Force is against’
but additionally provides the framework for the ‘what the Defence Force is for’ and consequently ‘what the Nation expects
its Defence Force to do’. This includes the positive role it should
play in support of nation building, as an adjunct to its traditional
roles and functions.

###### NATIONAL SECURITY, FOREIGN POLICY AND THE NATIONAL INTEREST

4. South Africa’s national security is centred on the advancement of its sovereignty, democracy, national values and freedoms, and its political and economic independence. To this end
it is clear that there is both a domestic and a regional dimension
to national security.

5. **Domestically, South African national security focuses on**
its sovereignty and the related priorities of: territorial integrity;


_Mr Roelf Meyer, Chairperson of the Defence Review Committee._

constitutional order; the security and continuance of national
institutions; the well-being, prosperity and upliftment of the
people; the growth of the economy; and demonstrable good
governance. As a developmental state, South Africa faces the
onerous task of addressing a number of pressing developmental challenges, including poverty, unemployment, inequality and
criminality.

6. **Regionally, South African national security inextricably**
hinges on the stability, unity and prosperity of the Southern African region, and the African continent in general. Africa is at the
centre of South African policy, and the growth and success of


-----

the South African economy are further intrinsically dependent on
enduring peace, stability, economic development and deepened
democracy on the continent. Significant growth of the economy
requires accelerated inbound and outbound trade (in particular
higher-value products) as well as attracting significant volumes of
foreign direct investment. Sustained value and volume of exports
to traditional markets must be achieved. Continental and other
high-growth emergent markets must be accessed.

7. Furthermore, security and development go hand in hand;
the two are inter-linked and intertwined; and both are the continent’s biggest challenges. South Africa, in partnership with likeminded African states, has a vested interest in contributing to the
rooting of democracy, the promotion of economic advancement
and the pursuit of peace, stability and development on the African continent.

8. South Africa is undeniably a major power in Africa (with the
leading economy, accounting for 24% of Africa’s GDP and 33%
of that of Sub-Saharan Africa) and is obliged to play a continental
leadership role, in conjunction with African partners, extending
to matters such as conflict prevention, conflict resolution, postconflict reconstruction and security-sector reform. This manifests
in contributions to UN, AU and SADC security, democracy and
good governance initiatives, as well as the conclusion of specific
bilateral partnerships with other African states in the political,
economic, social and security realms.

###### STRATEGIC CONTEXT


mainly from: lack of political rights; weak and dysfunctional states;
inadequate political and economic governance; the politicisation
of ethnicity; the marginalisation of groups; inappropriate military
involvement; and unconstitutional changes of governments.
Other prominent drivers of African insecurity include: competition over scarce resources; poverty, under-development and
poor human security; maritime insecurity; and endemic disease.

11. Nation states mitigate security risks through the coordinated application of a suite of ‘soft’ and ‘hard’ power interventions,
including diplomatic initiatives, political interventions, economic
measures and importantly, the deterrence value of the Defence
Force, coupled to military interventions where appropriate. History demonstrates that stability is seldom achieved through dialogue and negotiation alone. The use of force, or at least the
credible threat thereof, must at times secure constitutional order.

12. The policy principle of preventing armed conflict is
achieved by taking all political, diplomatic, informational, societal
and military measures to deter potential aggressors. South Africa’s international stature and balanced suite of defence capabilities contribute to overall deterrent capability and posture. This
is characterised by credible combat forces, operational prowess,
rapid force generation through trained Reserves, demonstrated
ability in field training, technological and doctrinal competence,
and the visible morale of personnel.

###### THE DEFENCE FORCE


13. The Constitution (1996) mandates the Defence Force as

cally since the previous Defence
Review in 1998. The world in
which we now find ourselves
is becoming increasingly complex and more unstable, with
increased risks to both international and domestic security.


10. Internationally, the security environment is characterised by a range of traditional and
non-traditional threats. These
include: persistent regional and
local conflicts; violent political,
ethnic and religious extremism;
acts of terror; proliferation of
weapons of mass destruction;
the involvement of non-state
actors in conflict; high levels of
international crime; and cyber
threats. Contemporary conflicts
and insecurity in Africa derive

-----

sovereignty, freedoms, territorial integrity, national interests,
people and values. Furthermore, certain defence functions are
carried across from the interim Constitution (1993). These include service in: compliance with the international obligations
of the Republic; the preservation of life, health or property;
the provision or maintenance of essential services; upholding
of law and order in support of the Police Service; and support
of any department of state for the purpose of socio-economic
development.

14. The Defence Force is a unique instrument and an important lever of power at the disposal of the State to pursue its
national security and foreign policy priorities and is consequently
at the core of South Africa’s national security. The deployment
of the Defence Force must thus be coordinated with the full
range of instruments which Government can bring to bear both
domestically and regionally. However, the Defence Force provides the means of last resort when other instruments of state
are unable to protect or defend South Africa.

15. South Africa has deployed its Defence Force widely in recent years – from counter-piracy in the SADC Maritime Area;
to peace-missions across the African continent; to a return to
border-safeguarding; to a range of other domestic security duties. Many of these operations have not required the Defence
Force to engage in significant combat operations. But when the
Defence Force has had to fight, these operations have been
characterised by hard and dangerous combat in complex human and physical conditions. Defence commitments, having the
potential to place South African forces in ‘harm’s way’, must
be informed both by the role South Africa plays on the African
continent and the pursuit of its national interests.

16. South Africa’s military capability must thus be commensurate with South Africa’s international status, strategic posture
and its inescapable continental leadership role. The Defence
Force must make a vital and unique contribution that complements South Africa’s diplomatic efforts and enhances South
Africa’s influence within wider international developments. As
South Africa expands its leadership role, it will concomitantly assume the obligation to provide experienced military leaders and
proficient military forces for peace missions and other military
operations on the African continent.

17. The Defence Force will be required to conduct a wide
range of multi-dimensional military operations across a spectrum of complex, highly fluid and often lethal situations characterised by a wide variety of threats. Operations in the face of political, ethnic, cultural, tribal, linguistic and religious tensions will
produce considerable human complexity. Future missions may
range from non-combat operations (where the use of force will
be absent or restricted to self-defence) to major combat operations with the application of potentially lethal force.


###### DEFENCE CAPABILITY AND FORCE   GENERATION REQUIREMENTS

18. Strategically, South Africa has a defensive posture, but will
maintain appropriate offensive military capabilities. The Defence
Force will be maintained as a balanced, modern and flexible
force employing advanced technologies appropriate to operations in the African environment.

19. The Defence Force will thus be appropriately equipped,
resourced and multi-role trained to execute successful operations across the spectrum of potential conflict. Informed by the
national security strategy, national interest and foreign policy, the
four strategic defence goals and thirteen strategic defence tasks
(Figure Overview-1) are focused on the attainment of the Defence Force’s constitutionally mandated functions and government’s national strategic goals and priorities.

20. The future force design will pursue a balance of capabilities that adhere to the strategic concepts of rapid reaction operations for interventions, expeditionary operations to project
forces for protracted periods, complex war fighting within the
human and physical dimensions of the battle space, interoperability of command and control capabilities, concurrency of
operations in multiple theatres and joint, inter-agency, interdepartmental and multinational (JI[2]M) operations.

21. The defence capability must be robust and flexible and
able to project and sustain joint landward, air, maritime, Special
Forces and military health operations over extended distances
for protracted periods on the continent. The military operating
attributes of: command and control; movement and manoeuvre; firepower; intelligence; protection and survivability; and
sustainment must be embedded in all capabilities.

22. **Joint Command and Control. South Africa requires**
a joint command and control capability to ensure joint action
with respect to land, air, sea, information and space, which must
be capable of integrating with multi-national, inter-departmental
and inter-agency components to achieve synergy. Joint command and control must be enabled through a comprehensive
situational awareness capability that provides integrated information acquired through liaison with allied and friendly forces
and governments, local human intelligence, and static and mobile sensors for enhanced military decision-making. This must
be pursued at the strategic, operational and tactical levels.

23. Defence Diplomacy. South Africa’s contribution to the
prevention and resolution of conflict will be enhanced through
an integration of its diplomatic, military and other efforts in a
complementary manner, and in instances supported by appropriate military capabilities that strengthen South Africa’s capacity
to influence international developments. This requires a defence


-----

diplomacy capability, whose strategy and main effort focus on
those national priorities where defence diplomacy engagements
will add the most value. Defence diplomacy efforts will further
centre on fostering long-standing relationships with key African
states and other strategic partners.

24. **Special Forces. South Africa’s increasingly complex and**
unstable security environment dictates an increasing reliance on
Special Forces in defence operations, indicating an expansion of
the current Special Forces capability in the landward, airborne
and amphibious operational domains. Special Forces capabilities must be suited to: strategic reconnaissance; ordered strategic special tasks; deep reconnaissance in support of the combat
services; and the execution of Special Forces-unique operations,
including (inter alia) hostage rescue and urban and anti-terror
operations.

25. **Special Operations Forces. Continental leadership re-**
sponsibilities and the requirement to protect own vital national
interests require South Africa to configure and maintain a specialised, highly mobile combat capability (closely linked to that of the
Special Forces) to rapidly deploy to remote areas for specific preventative and intervention operations. Such Special Operations
Forces must be able to conduct joint and supported airborne,
air-landed and sea-landed assault operations, with air- and seadeployable firepower, protection and manoeuvre. Special Forces
and Special Operations Forces will be supported by joint defence
capabilities, and will normally be followed-on by more robust
combat forces, specifically tailored to the mission.

26. **Medium-Combat Forces. The larger portion of South**
Africa’s landward defence capability must be configured and
maintained as a projectable, multi-roled medium-combat capability with enhanced firepower, manoeuvre and protection making it suitable for a range of contingencies. Such medium-forces
would be the bulk of South Africa’s contribution to enduring
multinational operations, own safeguarding operations and other
directed tasks. These medium-combat forces will be self-supporting, having embedded armour, artillery, engineer, communications, intelligence, logistics, medical support and other requirements. This medium capability may be further augmented by
heavy-combat capabilities. These forces also have the contingent
obligation to support civil authority and the Police Service, and
protect critical infrastructure if so required.

27. **Heavy-Combat Forces. The configuration and mainte-**
nance of a heavy-combat capability is required to deter South
Africa’s potential adversaries and conduct landward operations
in high-threat situations. It must be maintained at a core-growth
level within a self-supporting armour brigade comprising: armour, mechanised infantry, artillery, combat engineering, communications, intelligence, logistics, medical support and other
requirements. Although relatively small, this heavy-combat capa

bility must be able to augment the combat requirements of other
multi-roled medium and special operations capabilities, specifically where the threat situation dictates enhanced protection,
firepower and manoeuvre. This core must be able to expand in
response to changes in the strategic environment.

28. **Maritime Operations. South Africa has a maritime-**
dependent economy and significant maritime interests which it
must defend and protect through the configuration and maintenance of a versatile littoral maritime capability, a credible deepocean capability and effective maritime domain awareness. This
maritime capability must be able to provide an enduring presence in South Africa’s areas of maritime interest. This presence
will be pursued through a maritime defence concept involving
deterrence and powerful intervention through surface, subsurface and air capabilities. This will be pursued in concentric
layers that are focused on South Africa’s ports, territorial waters,
trade routes and marine resources. In support of the landward
strategy, the maritime capability must be able to conduct riverine
and inland water operations and augment firepower when so
required. It must also be capable of strategic reach and joint rapid
response across the spectrum of conflict, supporting the sustainment of protracted joint operations over long distances.

29. **Air Operations. South Africa requires a responsive and**
agile air defence capability to defend and protect the integrity
of South Africa’s airspace through the application of air power,
and to support the landward and maritime strategies. The air
defence capability must provide deterrence and powerful intervention during joint operations, specifically through comprehensive air domain awareness, air combat, combat support and air
mobility capabilities. Deployed landward and maritime forces
must be supported through appropriate airspace control, reconnaissance, close-air support, augmentation of firepower and
inter- and intra-theatre air mobility in complex operational circumstances. The air defence capability must also be capable of
strategic reach and joint rapid response across the spectrum of
conflict, supporting the sustainment of protracted joint operations over long distances.

30. **Military Health Support. South Africa requires a com-**
prehensive deployable military health protection capability for
deployed forces through sustained, layered military health support to protracted operations over long distances, including both
force health protection and force health sustainment.

31. **Expeditionary Operations. South Africa requires an**
expeditionary projection and sustainment capability to support
protracted operations in distant theatres, including forward-basing, the prepositioning of forces and equipment and the ongoing
supply and support of deployed forces. Projection and sustainment of expeditionary operations will be supported by strategic
air-lift, strategic sea-lift, and the use of rail and road networks.


-----

32. **Information Warfare. South Africa requires the pro-**
tection of its cyber-domain, through (inter alia) a comprehensive information warfare capability, integrated into its intelligence-related information systems at the international, national
and defence levels. Both defence and wider-government capabilities must be enhanced to secure vital networks.

###### CURRENT STATE OF THE DEFENCE FORCE

33. Defence expenditure is often expressed in terms of a
percentage of the GDP that is allocated to defence. The real
significance of this measure of defence spending is that it is an
indicator of national will. It is a clear indication of how seriously a
country takes its security, of how seriously it takes commitments
it has undertaken in respect of regional defence and security
arrangements, and of how willing it is to face up to unexpected
threats to itself or its region.

34. South Africa at present spends less than 1.2% of its GDP
on defence, translating to less than 5 cents out of every Rand of
total budget being expended on defence[1]. The Defence Force
is effectively 24% underfunded[2] (in respect of its current size
and shape). The Defence Force is in a critical state of decline,
characterised by: force imbalance between capabilities; block

_Figure Overview-2: Strategic Trajectory aligned to Three MTSF Cycles_

obsolescence and unaffordability of many of its main operating
systems; a disproportionate tooth-to-tail ratio; the inability to
meet current standing defence commitments; and the lack of
critical mobility. The current balance of expenditure between
personnel, operating and capital is both severely disjointed and
institutionally crippling.

35. Left unchecked, and at present funding levels, this decline
will severely compromise and further fragment the defence
capability. It is clear that certain defence capabilities, if not addressed now, will be lost in the very near future. The longer this
prevails, the greater the effort, time and cost will be to restore
the Defence Force.

36. There must be either a greater budget allocation or a significantly scaled-down level of ambition and commitment which
is aligned to the current budget allocation. In short, there are
two strategic options available for government: budget must be
determined by policy or budget must drive policy. The reality
will most probably lie somewhere in between. Nonetheless,
the fundamental principle remains that the force design must
match the level of commitment, without compromising the
necessary ratio between personnel, operations and capital, and
the balance between Regulars and Reserves.

37. Even with an immediate
intervention, it could take at least
five years to arrest the decline
and another five years to develop
a limited and sustainable defence
capability. The longer the neglect
is perpetuated, the greater the effort, time and cost that would be
necessary to arrest the decline and
restore the minimum capabilities
required to safeguard South Africa’s borders, protect its maritime
trade routes, conduct peace missions and humanitarian interventions, safeguard South Africa and
its people and defend and protect the country against external
aggression.


-----

###### THE STRATEGIC DE- FENCE TRAJECTORY

38. An immediate intervention is required to: (firstly) arrest the areas of critical decline
and create a firm foundation to
(secondly) develop a sustainable
defence capability appropriate to
South Africa’s international status,
strategic posture and inescapable
continental leadership role (Figure
Overview-2).

39. The Defence Force is required to undertake a detailed
military strategic planning process
to develop the future trajectory to
achieve the identified targets (Figure Overview-3). As first-order
guidelines, the following critical
milestones are proposed to assist
in such planning, namely:

strategy; setting governance, accountability and risk parameters;
setting the defence international engagement agenda; engaging


-----

with defence stakeholders; managing intra-governmental liaison;
and performing services related to Cabinet and Parliamentary
processes.

43. **Defence Accountability Concept. The Defence Ac-**
counting Officer and Head of Department remains accountable
for all defence resources. Linked to the organisational renewal
imperative hereunder, the current defence accountability concept must be re-assessed, and if necessary, adjusted in order
that the Defence Accounting Officer and Head of Department is
able to fully meet his or her statutory accountability responsibilities and obligations.

44. **Renewal of the Defence Organisation. The follow-**
ing suite of interventions is needed to address critical deficiencies, improve efficiency and refine defence procedures:
a. **Military Strategy and Military Doctrine.**
Guided by the Defence Policy, and using a rigorous military planning process, a military strategy
will be developed under authority of the Chief of
the Defence Force and the necessary operationallevel military doctrine established in support of the
military strategy. The military strategy will culminate
in the force design, force structure, establishment
table and key resource imperatives. The renewed
military doctrine will in turn lead to renewed military
tactics, techniques and procedures.
b. **Blueprint Force Design. The Chief of the De-**
fence Force will present the ensuing blueprint force
design to the Minister and Cabinet for approval and
this will serve as the basis for all aspects of future
planning. The achievement of the blueprint force
design will be critically informed by available resources and developments in the strategic environment. Resource constraints will be ameliorated by
adjusting levels of readiness, balancing core-growth
with operational necessity and through a careful
mix of Regulars and Reserves within the one-force
approach.
c. **Defence Force Capability Strategy and**
**Technology and Capital Plans.** Concurrent to
the development of the Military Strategy and the
Blueprint Force Design, will be the development
of the long-term Defence Force Capability Strategy
and the publishing of prioritised ten-year Defence
Force Technology and Capital Plans. Predicated on
the desire to achieve heightened levels of efficiency,
effectiveness and economy with commensurately
reduced bureaucracy and shorter delivery timeframes, the acquisition agent will ensure efficient
and timeous acquisition of those defence systems
specified by the military command as well as the
through-life-support of defence systems. In addi

tion, and in collaboration with the Chief Defence
Scientist, it will assist and support defence research
and development.
d. **Organisational Structure. Pursuant to the de-**
termination of the Military Strategy and the Blueprint
Force Design, the Defence Force structure and establishment table will be adjusted to ensure the establishment of cohesive military combat formations,
embedded with own organic support capabilities
established ‘under command’ to the lowest possible functional level. Such support capabilities will
include: personnel, finance, information and logistics
(equipment, procurement, maintenance and technical services).
e. **Extended Long-term Defence Development**
**Plan. The Defence Accounting Officer must cap-**
ture the intent of the Military Strategy, Force Design,
Force Structure, Capability Strategy and Technology and Capital Plans into an extended long-term
defence development plan, inclusive of an aligned
funding trajectory, and integrate this within the government planning cycle.
f. **The Military Command Line. The line of com-**
mand authority prescribed in the Constitution remains crucial to the effective functioning of the Defence Force and the successful execution of military
tasks. On-going organisational renewal must recognise the hierarchical nature of the Defence Force
and must clearly distinguish between command and
staff lines, erasing any ambiguity that may exist.
g. **Mission Command. The military leadership phi-**
losophy will be that of mission command, which implies that military commanders, at whichever level,
must be invested with the absolute responsibility to
act or, in certain circumstances, to decide not to act,
within the framework of a superior commander’s
intent.
h. **Empowerment of Military Commanders.**
Military commanders must have the necessary authority and administrative delegations to execute
their assigned mandates. A comprehensive defence delegation regime must be established in law
whereby powers and duties can be delegated down
the command line – one step at a time down the
command line – with commanders at all levels being
responsible and accountable for their resources and
actions.

45. **Renewal of the Personnel Component. The follow-**
ing suite of interventions must be implemented to ensure that
the future Defence Force is advantaged through the quality of
its people:
a. **Future Defence Leaders. The Defence Force is**


-----

recognised as a key institution for the development
of leadership within the wider South African society. There will be no compromise on the education, training and development of the future Officer,
Warrant Officer and Non-Commissioned Officer;
to do so will have dire implications for the operational success of the Defence Force. With regard
to officers, a unique and dedicated officer recruitment programme must be established that attracts
the best young men and women South Africa has
to offer. The military professional education, training
and development of young officers will be founded
in a broad-liberal education at the Defence Academy
and the subsequent education, training and development programmes within the Defence Force.
b. **Future Soldiers. Future operational success re-**
mains critically dependent on the quality and calibre
of the future soldier – and the development of responsible, value-driven and disciplined soldiers. The
Defence Force recruitment system will be devolved
to Services and pursued on a decentralised basis.
The future soldier will be a skilled, healthy, fit, and
highly disciplined military professional imbued with
a high level of morale and sense of duty. The Defence Force will be an equitable, broadly representative and gender-aligned national asset. A through-life
assessment and selection system will be established
to inform merit-based career advancement for all
soldiers, coupled to education, training and development achievement.
c. **Military Discipline. Rigorous military training de-**
velops self-control, discipline, character and integrity.
Sound military discipline, founded upon respect for,
loyalty to, and properly constituted authority is the
cornerstone of a professional and functional Defence
Force. Military commanders remain responsible for
the conduct of their subordinates and must thus have
appropriate mechanisms at their disposal to address
failures in discipline. A revised and cohesive military
disciplinary system, a minor corrective measures
system and consequent administrative measures are
required to meet the constitutional imperative that
“the defence force must be structured and managed
as a disciplined military force”.
d. **Future Defence Civilians. Attention will be given**
to the development of a competent civilian component at all levels in defence. Civilian education, training and development programmes will be tailored to
integrate with domestic and foreign learning opportunities. Particular focus will be given to the high-level
analytical and strategic competencies required of defence personnel serving in the Defence Secretariat.


A merit-based career advancement system will be
established, coupled to education, training and development achievement.
e. **Multiple mechanisms are required to place de-**
fence members who no longer conform to post and
mustering requirements in other departments or
agencies, or to honourably exit such members from
the Defence Force.

46. **Supporting Defence.** The following suite of interventions must be implemented to ensure that the Defence Force
receives effective functional support:
a. **Defence Industry Sector Strategy. A defence**
industry sector strategy must be developed to meet
critical defence needs. The success of the defence
industry will be its integration into mainstream South
African industrial policy as a distinct and supported
sector in the wider industrial base. Defence will work
together with all stakeholders towards the proper
integration of the defence industry sector into the
Industrial Policy Action Plan 3, and any subsequent
amendment thereto. A National Defence Industry
Council will be established to ensure close coordination between the Defence Force and the industry.
b. **Defence Technology Programme. Defence**
must remain abreast of developments in defence
technology and other potentially relevant technologies required developing, manufacturing and supporting complex defence systems. A broad range of
technical and technological skills and capabilities must
be established over the long term. A Chief Defence
Scientist will have responsibility for defining, coordinating and maintaining diverse defence research and
development requirements, including policy analysis
capacities.
c. **Defence Enterprise Information System.**
An integrated defence enterprise information system, linked to the National Treasury’s Integrated
Resource Management System, is required as the
backbone information system to drive both defence
administration and defence command and control.
It must integrate and optimise all other defence information sub-system requirements and serve as a
basis for ensuring standardisation, compatibility, connectivity and interoperability. It will be established
as the foundation for all defence business processes
and activities.

47. **Sustainable Future Force. Irrespective of the future**
level of funding allocated to defence, the inviolable principle of
maintaining the 40:30:30 ratio in the corporate Defence Budget
(between the funding of personnel, operating and capital) should


-----

inform all defence planning, notwithstanding that some components are technology-heavy and others personnel-heavy. The
‘compensation for employees’ portion should not exceed 40%
of the Defence Budget, and must include an overall minimum
of 8% of the personnel allocation directed to the development
and utilisation of the Reserves. The 30% capital portion of the
defence allocation should be directed at urgent equipment requirements to meet defence operational commitments and the
maintenance of a core conventional defence capability with the
necessary critical mass to expand when so required. The 30%
operating portion of the defence allocation must ensure day-today functioning. Unforeseen tasking of the Defence Force must
be funded additionally to the base-line allocation.

48. **Strategic Communication Intervention. The De-**
fence Force is an important pillar of the South African state and
should be respected by the people of South Africa and the international community alike for the standard of military professionalism it cultivates and maintains. A deliberate communication intervention is required to pursue a national consensus on
defence matters, whereby the people of South Africa are comprehensively informed that their Defence Force stands ready
to: defend and protect South Africa; safeguard South Africa and
its people; contribute continental security and human development; and provide support in times of crisis and disaster. Specific emphasis must be placed on the developmental role of the
Defence Force.

###### DEFENCE CAPABILITY RENEWAL PRIORITIES

49. **Milestone 1 Capability Enhancement**
a. Identify and direct preservation-funding to those
conventional defence capabilities at extreme risk.
b. Enhance the strategic awareness capability; restore
an effective intelligence capability at the strategic,
operational and tactical levels; and establish a corps
of professional analysts.
c. Expand and enhance the Special Forces capability
and the concomitant ability to insert, support and
extract such forces.
d. Optimise the border safeguarding capability, and acquire tailored equipment and weapon systems.
e. Establish a permanent forward base.
f. Reestablish/enhance a tactical airfield unit capability
and a naval port-operating capability.
g. Ensure troop-contribution obligations are maintained at the standard whereby reimbursement is
guaranteed. Specific emphasis is to be placed on the
optimal serviceability of capabilities during operational missions.
h. Improve stock-levels, with specific emphasis on:
i. Replacement of field support equipment, in

cluding water purification, field kitchen, field
accommodation, field workshop and field
hospital equipment.
ii. Rejuvenation of workshops, mobilisation
stores, gun and vehicle parks, depots and
magazines, and the Naval Dockyard; the establishment of a naval base on the east coast
and the development of facilities at naval
stations.
iii. Restocking of munitions, spares and general
stores to levels that allow the conduct of effective training and effective combat operations.

50. **Milestone 2 Capability Enhancement**
a. Development of a special operations joint rapid response intervention capability with the rejuvenation
of airborne and air-landed and sea-landed assault
forces and associated equipment.
b. Simultaneous and critical renewal of the medium
and light airlift capability, the in-flight refuelling capability, and the military air-ambulance capability, and
the enhancement of the medium rotary-wing lift
capability.
c. Enhancement of air domain awareness, including
static, mobile and airborne surveillance and tracking systems together with associated interdiction
capabilities.
d. Enhancement of maritime domain awareness and
the extended maritime protection capability, inclusive of patrol vessels, reconnaissance aircraft,
unmanned surveillance systems as well as static,
ship-borne and airborne surveillance and tracking
systems.
e. Renewal of the hydrographic survey capability to
both support maritime operations and ensure the
international hydrographic, nautical charting and
maritime warning obligations of South Africa.
f. Extended maritime protection capability, inclusive of
inshore and offshore patrol capability with organic,
combat-enhanced maritime helicopters able to repel symmetric and asymmetric threats.

51. **Milestone 3 Capability Enhancement**
a. Renewal of the landward combat capability.
i. Retention and renewal of the ‘core-growth’
heavy-combat capability to augment peacekeeping in high-risk situations, peace enforcement, and to provide an essential component
of the deterrent capability.
ii. Renewal of the larger medium-combat
capability.
iii. Renewal of the landward logistic, related
vehicles and field ambulance capability in


-----

an integrated manner to support all military
operations.
iv. Establishment of a rapidly deployable indirect
fire-support capability to augment the combat
capability of deployed forces.
b. Enhancement of the air combat capability through
aerial weapon augmentation, including:
i. Beyond-visual-range air-to-air, precision air-toground and anti-ship capabilities for the light
fighter.
ii. Close-range air-to-air and air-to-ground capabilities for the lead-in fighter trainer.
c. Full integration of the combat helicopter capability
into the landward and allied roles, inclusive of aerial
weapons, and not limited to:
i. Long- and short-range anti-tank/anti-bunker.
ii. Self-defence air-to-air capabilities.
d. Expansion of the airlift capability with heavier and
longer-range fixed-wing capabilities to project and
sustain combat forces over extended distances.
e. Establishment of a heavy rotary-wing lift capability for
intra-theatre support to Special Forces, Special Operations Forces, sea-landed operations, disaster and
emergency relief, search and rescue operations and
medical support to deployed forces.
f. Extension of the current maritime combat support
capability to support frigate-type and offshore patroltype vessels over extended distances. Allied thereto
is the requirement for a forward deployable sea

borne depot and technical support capability.
g. Establishment of a joint sealift capability that can effectively project and sustain combat capabilities over
extended distances.
h. Renewal of the rail-lift capability as an extremely
cost-effective means of long-distance transport of
personnel, vehicles, heavy equipment, munitions,
fuel and general stores.

52. **Milestone 4 Capability Requirement**
a. Enhanced and expanded ground-based air defence
capability to protect bases, static installations and
landward forces.
b. Renewed heavy combat capability, specifically armour and medium artillery capabilities within the
core growth.
c. Enhanced combat engineer capability, inclusive of
mine-detection and clearing, field earth-moving,
bridge-laying and other engineering combat support
tasks.

#### GLOSSARY OF TERMS

|TERM|DESCRIPTION|
|---|---|

|Accountability|The liability and obligation to answer to a superior for the proper use of delegated responsibil- ity, authority and resources.|
|---|---|
|Acquisition|The process by which defence matériel is obtained, such process involving (inter alia): require- ments planning, operational research, technology acquisition, design and development, opera- tional qualification, quality assurance, industrialisation, production, commissioning, maintenance and disposal.|
|Amphibious|Military operations characterised by attacks launched from the sea by naval and landing forces against hostile shores. Landing of expeditionary forces on a shore or at a port already secured by friendly forces is not usually included in the concept.|
|Asymmetrical warfare|Violent conflict between a formal military and an informal, poorly-equipped, but resilient op- ponent. Respective tactics differ. Conflict may (inter alia) assume the nature of ‘unconventional warfare’, which extends to irregular force operations such as ‘guerrilla warfare’, ‘insurgency’ and ‘acts of terror’, and antithesis regular force operations such as ‘counter-insurgency’ and ‘counter-terrorism’.|
|Battalion|Tactical army formation. In South African infantry doctrine normally comprises three rifle com- panies and a support company. In United Nations doctrine, the same comprises four rifle companies and no support company.|
|Battalion Group|See Combat Group hereunder.|
|Blue-Water Navy|Maritime force capable of sustained operation across the deep waters of open oceans. A blue- water navy allows a country to project power far from the home country and usually includes one or more aircraft carriers. It implies force protection from sub-surface, surface and airborne threats and a sustainable logistic reach, allowing a persistent presence at range. A hallmark of a true blue-water navy is the ability to replenish at sea.|
|Bridging Training|Training to address previous shortcomings.|
|Brigade|(1) Formation of fighting units with supporting arms and services, normally commanded by a brigadier. (2) Unit normally smaller than a division, to which are attached groups, battalions and smaller units to meet anticipated requirements.|
|Broad-Liberal Education|A broad education that empowers individuals with broad knowledge and transferable skills, and cultivates a strong sense of values, ethics, and civic responsibility. It is more a way of studying than a specific course or field of study. In this instance the curriculum is based on a programme of core military sciences with detailed specialisation in at least one military academic discipline.|
|Campaign|A controlled series of simultaneous or sequential operations designed to achieve an operational commander's objective, normally within a given time or space.|
|Campaign Quality|The ability to win decisive combat operations and to sustain those operations for as long as necessary while quickly adapting to unpredictable changes both in the context and the character of the conflict.|
|Civil Oversight|Adherence of the Defence Force to elected authority as may be primarily expressed through the Commander-in-Chief, the Executive and the Legislature.|

It includes: The authority to employ forces operationally at a specific level, but does not in itself include administrative responsibility for the forces concerned. The lawful authority every officer has over men & women in his/her charge by virtue of his/ her rank and appointment.|
|Combat Service Support|Elements, such as logistic support, technical services and military health support, provide ser- vice support to combat forces as part of a theatre, command, or task force formed for combat operations.|
|Combat Support|Elements, such as artillery, air defence artillery, signals and military engineers, provide fire- support and other support to the combat forces as part of a theatre, command, or task force formed for combat operations.|
|Compound Warfare|Occurs where states and non-state actors choose to exploit all modes of war simultaneously and use a mix of advanced conventional weapons, irregular tactics, mercenarism, piracy, acts of terror, disruptive criminality, etc, to destabilise an existing order.|
|Contingency Stock Level Reserves|Ensuring the availability of resources (equipment and personnel) of appropriate quality and quantity as per reserve stock policy.|


Control


The process through which the commander, assisted by assigned military staff, organises, regulates and coordinates the activities of the force (Staff Line) and includes:

Administrative Control, which is the direction or exercise of authority over subordinate or
other organisations in respect to administration and support.

## INTRODUCTION


##### THE DEFENCE MANDATE


1. The Constitution of the Republic of South Africa[1] mandates the Defence Force, as the only lawful military force in the
Republic, for the protection and defence of the Republic, its
sovereignty, territorial integrity, national interests and people, in
accordance with the Constitution and the principles of interna
tional law regulating the use of force.


3. Furthermore, the Defence Act, 2002 [Sec 18(1)(d)] provides that Defence Force may be employed to effect national
border control.

4. The Defence Mandate logic is unpacked as per Figure Intro-1 below.


2. Schedule 6, Section 24 of the 1996
Constitution provides that the following
“Functions of the National Defence Force”,
as originally established in Section 227 of
the 1993 Interim Constitution, “continue in
force as if the previous Constitution had not
been repealed”:
a. For service in the defence of
the Republic, for the protection
of its sovereignty and territorial
integrity.
b. For service in compliance with
the international obligations of
the Republic with regard to international bodies and other
states.
c. For service in the preservation of

life, health or property.
d. For service in the provision
or maintenance of essential
services.

e. For service in the upholding of law and order in the **MANDATE FOR THE**
Republic in cooperation with the South African Po- **DEFENCE REVIEW**

f. For service in support of any department of state for
the purpose of socio-economic upliftment.

1 Constitution, 1996, Chapter 11, Article 200(2), page 113.


-----

_“Major changes, both dramatic and evolutionary, have_
_taken place in the defence environment over the past 15_
_years. The policy review and strategy would of necessity take_
_this into consideration and will be informed by a clear-eyed_
_assessment of what we want our foreign policy to achieve,_
_the potential threats facing us, and socio-economic interests_
_in what is a very uncertain era of growing competition among_
_new major powers. The new environment requires new think-_
_ing and new approaches. To this end, we remain committed_
_to creating a dependable, agile and flexible Human Capital_
_base in the defence force._
_We had a Defence Workshop from 19 to 21 March 2010_
_to review the work done in this respect and are of the view_
_that we need to give this added impetus. It will enable long-_
_term planning in terms of force levels, force structure and_
_equipment needs._
_For the SANDF and in particular the SA Army to remain_
_successful, it will have to take into account the complexities_
_of African politics. The size of the continent, its geographic_
_and climate complexity, as well as the lack of transport infra-_
_structure, problems engendered by economic under-devel-_
_opment and the diverse military challenges it may encoun-_
_ter, will necessitate the SANDF to be well and appropriately_
_equipped and trained for both its external and internal roles_
_as prescribed by the Constitution.”_

6. In response to the above requirement, work continued
towards the development of a new policy and strategy for Defence. In the 13 April 2011 Defence Budget Speech it was
stated:
_“We promised to deal with a number of issues of policy_
_review and we have done that. The long overdue Defence Re-_
_view is here. We have a (departmental discussion document)_
_draft that we would like to present to the Parliamentary Com-_
_mittees at their earliest opportunity. Thereafter we would like_
_to embark on a public consultative process before we submit_
_the final Defence Review to Parliament.”_

7. Subsequently, the Minister of Defence and Military Veterans (hereafter referred to as ‘the Minister’) constituted a Defence
Review Committee whose mandate it was to both prepare a
consultative document and engage in a comprehensive public
consultation process with key stakeholders, interested parties
and civil society. The Defence Review Committee met for the
first time at the Castle of Good Hope on 14 July 2011, when the
Minister provided the Committee with its Mandate and Terms of
Reference (Annexure A). The Minister stated that the Defence
Review is required to:
a. Validate and confirm the defence mandate as prescribed in the Constitution and other statutes.
b. Provide a defence policy that is supportive of government’s strategic intent.


c. Describe the complete spectrum of defence
responsibility.
d. Indicate the strategic defence concept, broad capability requirements and high-level defence doctrine.
e. Posit a level of defence effort that should be funded by government and pursued by the Defence
Organisation.
f. Provide policy guidance for the development of
the blueprint design and structure of the Defence
Organisation.
g. Provide a high-level first order discussion on the
funding principles for Defence.

8. The Defence Review Committee thus developed the
draft Defence Review as an accurate reflection of the results of a
comprehensive diagnostic analysis and a transparent consultation
process.


9. The 1996 White Paper on Defence and the 1998 Defence
Review were seminal documents negotiated with the wider
South African public, including three consultative conferences
under the auspices of Parliament. The focus was on the political
transition from apartheid to a democratic South Africa, and the
concomitant integration of diverse statutory and non-statutory
armed forces into a single Defence Force. Subsequent emergent
imperatives made it necessary to review the conclusions of the
1996 White Paper on Defence and the 1998 Defence Review,
through a new Defence Review process.

###### GROWING REGIONAL RESPONSIBILITY

10. Nearly fifteen years later, there are inevitably new challenges and new opportunities. South Africa’s political and economic integration into the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and the African Union (AU) has led to greater
involvement on the continent. This includes vibrant engagement
through a new regional and continental security architecture:
the AU Peace and Security Council; the SADC Organ on Politics,
Defence and Security; and the SADC Mutual Defence Pact.

11. South Africa’s strategic environment remains fluid and challenging, regionally and on the continent as a whole. Increasingly, there are non-traditional security threats, non-state actors
and non-conventional manifestations of insecurity and instability.
There is a further growing requirement for international intervention in conflict areas.

12. The United Nations (UN) has become more assertive
in African peacekeeping. At the same time, regional and subregional organisations are expected to take more responsibility


##### WHY A NEW DEFENCE REVIEW?


-----

14. South Africa has committed forces to peace missions across the continent,
commencing with a peace
support operation in which
over a 1 000 troops were
deployed to help stabilise
the conflict in Burundi. This
commitment increased to
the extent that South Africa
at one stage became the
10[th] largest troop contributor to UN peace missions
– a far cry from the deployment of one battalion at any
time that was envisaged in
1998.

15. Figure Intro-2, reflecting the size of the African continent in relation
to other states, illustrates
the physical magnitude of
regional and sub-regional
responsibilities.

16. Whereas Figure Intro-2 demonstrates complexity due to the relative
size of Africa when compared to other countries,
Figure Intro-3 illustrates the
fragmentation that arose

_Figure Intro-2: Size of Africa Relative to a Selection of States in other Continents[2]_

from the former colonisation of Africa. Consequent
incipient instability was created by colonial boundary
commissions and the refor managing conflict. This implies a greater role for the AU and sultant fragmentation of families, communities, clans, tribes and
SADC in responding to regional conflict, with South Africa being nations.
expected to play a significant role in both organisations.

18. In 2010 Cabinet ordered the return of the Defence Force
to border duties, with primary responsibility for safeguarding
land, air and maritime borders. This has significant implications,
due to the extent of these borders:
a. South Africa’s land area of 1 219 090 km[2] has 4 471
km of land borders. Effective protection of these
borders requires sustained deployment of significant
numbers of army units, light aircraft and helicopters.
b. South Africa’s land area has an air border of 7 660
km. Effective protection of this border requires
sustained electronic surveillance, with air and land
reaction forces always available to counter illegal
intrusion.
c. South Africa’s coastline is 3 924 km at the high
water line, with an economic exclusive zone of
1 553 000 km[2] (of which Marion Island and Prince
Edward Island comprise 474 400 km[2]). Sustained

_Figure Intro-3: Colonisation of Africa as at 1930[3]_

air and maritime patrols are needed to protect this
coastline and the economic zone.

19. Domestically, the priorities of Government are the reduction of poverty and the creation of conditions for economic growth and social development. From the 1990s, when
the Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP) was
launched, through to current priorities identified in the MediumTerm Strategic Framework (MTSF), Government policy has emphasised the role of the State in meeting development needs.
Other examples include the Accelerated Shared Growth Initiative of South Africa (ASGISA) and Vision 2030. Consequently,
the role of the Defence Force in a developmental state needs
to be expressed in policy alongside the traditional defence functions. This should not distract the Defence Force from its mandated functions, but policy should express how the execution of
these functions and other initiatives can also contribute to the

development of our people.

20. It can be concluded that:
a. The global shift in focus regarding threats
and sources of insecurity has necessitated a
review of defence and
security policies worldwide. South Africa cannot escape this and must
clearly contextualise the
defence contribution to
national security, with
particular emphasis on
achieving national goals
and defending vital
interests.
b. Regional and continental
socio-economic integration is the foundation for
Africa’s socio-economic
development, and essential for South Africa’s
own prosperity.
c.    South Africa’s national
security strategy, foreign policy and defence
policy cannot be viewed
in isolation from one
another. South Africa’s
domestic security is further inextricably linked
to that of regional security, and vice versa. The


-----

struggle for a better life in South Africa is intertwined
with the pursuit of ‘a better Africa in a better world’.
d. Africa is at the centre of South Africa’s foreign policy.
South Africa must therefore continue to support
regional and continental processes to respond to
and resolve crises, strengthen regional integration,
significantly increase intra-African trade and champion sustainable development and opportunities
in Africa. Peace, stability and security are essential
preconditions for development. South Africa must
consequently continue to play a leading role in conflict prevention, peace-enforcement, peacekeeping,
peace-building, and post-conflict reconstruction.
e. South Africa’s growing peacekeeping commitment
on the African continent has compelled the need to
re-examine and reprioritise defence roles and functions accordingly in pursuit of the “African Agenda”.
f. The significant responsibility to properly safeguard
South Africa’s vast land, air and sea borders and
combat maritime crime and piracy requires a fresh
look at the methods of doing so and the defence
capabilities required.
g. Defence will be called upon, both through its collateral capabilities and also through dedicated initia
_Figure Intro-4: Defence Policy within the Hierarchy of National Policy_


tives, to cooperate with the Police Service in times
of turmoil and to deepen its contribution to the developmental agenda of the State.

21. The above requires a thorough assessment of what part
the Defence Force is expected to play in maintaining national
and regional security, and in supporting the intended regional
and continental role of South Africa as a country. This in turn requires an assessment of what defence capabilities are required.
It is clear that the current defence capabilities are not adequate.
The assumptions against which the 1998 Defence Review Force
Design was constructed quickly became invalid. In any case, the
selected force design was never attained and remained out of
reach within a dwindling defence budget.


##### WHAT IS THE DEFENCE REVIEW?


22. Chuter[4] indicates that “national security policy is the process of maintaining, coordinating and employing the assets of the
security sector so that they contribute optimally to the nation’s
strategic goals”. Chuter concomitantly indicates that “defence
policy is the process of maintaining, coordinating and employing
the assets of the defence sector so that they contribute optimally
to the nation’s security policy goals”. Chuter identifies the in

4 Presentation by Dr David Chuter, an independent security analyst, on 24 November 2011 at the Minister’s inaugural “Defence Review Public Engagement Seminar”.


-----

separable linkage between national security policy, foreign policy
and defence policy by stating that: “Defence Forces exist primarily to underpin the domestic and foreign policies of a state” and
positions defence policy as: “a national-level policy which fits into
a policy hierarchy, converting government security policy objectives into orientations and tasks for defence, projecting a policy
with a coherent set of aims and objectives and supported by
the appropriate human and matériel resources to put them into
practice”. This is illustrated diagrammatically in Figure Intro-4.

23. Defence policy is thus understood as that body of public
policy that a government pronounces as its guidelines for the
defence objectives and functions of its armed forces. To this end,
defence policy defines the defence or military scope of national
security, the strategic posture, defence capabilities, defence alliances, and security institutions or mechanisms (both national and
international) that govern the utilisation of the Defence Force.
The national defence policy also clearly identifies the possible
threats to a country’s national security and its society, economy,
territory and environment, and provides options to government
on how the Defence Force should deal with such threats.


ciently robust to respond to a number of plausible deviations
from the expected defence trajectory. Faced with a persistently
troubled peace and an uncertain future, an analysis of possible
contingencies can only be based on an assessment of the key
characteristics and trends of the security environment and the
trajectories along which the security environment could develop. There is, however, no guarantee that the future will develop
along that trajectory, and thus defence planning should be robust enough to allow for some deviation from the baseline, but
cannot be completely unconstrained. The Defence Review posits the defence ways and means to deliver on national security
priorities. It indicates where effort must be directed and where
resources must be focused. It expresses itself on what further
policies and strategies are required. It sets a clear target for the
defence capabilities that are to be established over the next 30
years and charts a course for getting there. The Defence Review,
as a long-term and extended long-term policy document, seeks
to:
a. **Firstly, set a long-term policy and strategy agenda**
for Defence that will set the stage for the next 30
years of defence effort. This does not mean that the
Defence Review will not be reviewed and augmented in the next decade, but that it provides a stable
base against which long-term plans can be set and
budgets aligned with its intent.
b. **Secondly, be comprehensive and detailed by en-**
gaging defence matters at a strategic level without
digressing into the operational and tactical level of
debate.
c. **Thirdly, pronounce sufficiently on the continuum of**
policy, strategy, force design and structure needed to
set a stable long-term defence planning agenda[5].
d. **Fourthly, express high-level defence doctrine.**
e. **Fifthly, require the Defence Force to unpack the**
Defence Review into concrete long-term plans and
programmes.
f. **Sixthly, provide a series of planning milestones to**
guide discussions on future defence funding.


_“As far as the Defence Review is concerned, we note that_
_defence policy has a broad impact on society, and it is an_
_important consumer of taxpayer’s money. Future defence_
_policy will therefore have an impact on a broad range of_
_interests. It will have an impact on our region, amongst_
_others. Besides the direct issues, such as the purposes_
_to which defence can be turned: peacekeeping, maritime_
_protection, antipiracy, disaster relief, defence against_
_foreign aggression, and the balance of all of these, it will_
_additionally affect areas such as employment, industrial_
_development, etc. It is therefore vitally important that we_
_make those important values, needs and interests known_
_in the formulation of this review”._

**Dr Gavin Bradshaw – Department of Political**
**and Development Studies, NMMU**


24. In essence, national defence policy defines the strategic
intent of government regarding Defence. Therefore, a country’s defence policy, given these characteristic features, must be
subjected to periodic review and update so as to reflect factors
that have influenced a change in Government’s guidelines for the
defence function.

25. The Defence Review is not a prediction of the future. The
Defence Review recognises that the future remains uncertain
and unpredictable and thus defence capabilities must be suffi

26. The Defence Review takes its lead from the national security construct, national posture and national interests. This is
augmented by South Africa’s foreign policy obligations and aspirations. The Defence Review draws on the Constitution and
other Statutes, establishes fundamental principles and tenets and
cascades these to a future-orientated, concept-driven, effectsbased defence policy and strategy.


##### DEVELOPING THE FUTURE      DEFENCE POLICY


5 The 1998 Defence Review, due mainly to its limited focus on the matters of integration and transformation, did not deal with the full spectrum of
policy, strategy and design.


-----

27. This effects-based approach examines what defence and
other national capabilities must be applied to realise strategic
outcomes in peace, conflict and war. The effects-based approach establishes the clear and unambiguous future mission,
goals and tasks for Defence.

28. The Defence Review adopts a straightforward internal
logic comprised of:
a. An understanding of the South African State, its people, its systems and geography and posits the unique
challenges facing South Africa as a Developmental
State.
b. An understanding of the global, continental, regional
and domestic security trends and the implications
thereof for South Africa. The future spectrum of
conflict is posited, expressing a range of contingencies which may arise.
c. The emergent national security strategy is expressed
as a construct and the national interests and vital interests of South Africa are posited. This culminates
in six strategic national security effects which must
be pursued by the Defence Force.
d. The Defence Mandate, Mission, Strategic Goals and
Tasks are systematically unpacked to determine the
scale of defence effort required for each and the
concomitant defence capability requirements. This
scale of effort will remain the fundamental basis for
the development of the force design. Many countries would describe the scale of defence effort as
the “level of defence ambition” (Annexure D).
e. Force generation guidelines are given, concomitant
supporting defence concepts posited and high-order defence capabilities expressed.
f. The development of future defence leaders is discussed, including the development of Regulars, Reserves and Defence Civilians. A reconstructed Defence Academy is posited.
g. Contemporary defence expenditure is unpacked at
the global, continental and regional levels.
h. The Defence Strategic Trajectory is posited as the
strategic-level guideline to develop the Defence
Force for the next 15-20 years across the five planning milestones.
i. Lastly, the fundamentals of the future defence and
procurement strategies are provided, with the focus areas and strategic and niche areas identified,
and the future positioning of the defence industry is
discussed.


##### OVERARCHING DEFENCE PRINCIPLES


29. The Defence Review advances certain principles which
the Defence Force, as a representative and trusted non-partisan
national asset, must pursue, namely:
a. **Principle 1: The Defence Force will be subject to**
the Constitution, national statutes, national policy
and the national regulatory framework. Emphasis
will be placed on the Defence Force’s compliance
with international law, specifically international humanitarian law, and other binding instruments or regimes regulating armed conflict, the use of force or
the control, prohibition or use of certain weapons.
b. **Principle 2: The Defence Force will be subject to**
sound civil control by Cabinet and robust civil oversight by Parliament. Due cognisance will be given to
the unique nature of the Defence Force relative to
the wider public service.
c. **Principle 3: The Defence Mandate, Mission, Stra-**
tegic Goals and Tasks will be focused on the attainment of the Defence Force’s constitutionally mandated functions and government’s national strategic
goals and priorities. Strategically, the Defence Force
will adopt a defensive posture, but will maintain offensive operational capabilities.
d. **Principle 4: The Defence Force must stand ready**
to: defend and protect South Africa; safeguard South
Africa and its people; contribute to regional and
continental security; and provide support in times of
crisis and disaster - both domestically and regionally,
man-made or natural. As an important pillar of the
South African state, the Defence Force will contribute to national development.
e. **Principle 5:** The Defence Force will strive to be
seen as a representative, equitable and genderaligned national asset. Defence Force members will
be skilled, healthy, fit, and highly disciplined professionals imbued with a high level of morale and sense
of duty. The Defence Force should be respected
by the people of South Africa and the international
community alike for the standard of military professionalism it cultivates and maintains.
f. **Principle 6: The Defence Force will be maintained**
as a balanced, modern and flexible force employing
advanced technologies appropriate to operations in
the African environment. It will thus be appropriately equipped, resourced and multi-role trained to


-----

execute successful operations across the spectrum
of potential conflict. All defence capabilities will be
embedded with command and control, intelligence,
firepower, protection, manoeuvre and sustainment.
g. **Principle 7: The Defence Force will be organised**
into military combat capabilities and formations.
There will be a clear distinction between command
and staff lines. Command lines will be clear and unambiguous. Commanders will have the necessary
delegations to execute their assigned mandates,
have commensurate responsibility and authority
over all resources assigned, and will account for their
resources and actions. The Defence Force will be
enabled through a single overarching information
technology infrastructure.
h. **Principle 8: Mission Command will be the leader-**
ship philosophy. Leadership and professionalism will
be the cornerstone of future strategic, operational
and tactical success.


principles, crafted the key thematic areas for the Defence Review and determined the initial document
architecture.
c. **Phase 3: From mid-October 2011 to mid-March**
2012 the Committee engaged in the drafting of the
initial concept document.
d. **Phase 4: From mid-March to mid-April 2012 the**
Committee engaged in refining the initial concept
document and developed it into the ‘Consultative
Draft Defence Review’ for public release and public
engagement.
e.    Phase 5:
i. On 12 April 2012 the Minister conducted a
public launch of the ‘Consultative Draft Defence Review’ and by so doing launched
the process of public engagement on the
document.
ii. A website was launched (www.sadefencereview2012.org) which provided the document
in PDF format, made available key research
essays used in the development of the draft
document and indicated the upcoming public engagement process. Links were further
launched on Facebook and Twitter.
f. **Phase 6: The Committee launched a comprehen-**
sive public participation process which stretched
from 18 April until end-July 2012. During this process a number of public engagements were conducted across South Africa in which members of
the public were invited to deliver comment on
their expectations of Defence and the ‘Consultative
Draft Defence Review’. These events (Annexure B)
included:
i. Information briefings to Parliamentary
committees.
ii. _Imbizos at the grass-roots level in all nine prov-_
inces of South Africa.
iii. Engagements with academics and NGOs
hosted by various university bodies, academic
‘think-tanks’, and with identified stakeholders
which included the Military Command and the
Defence Secretariat Board.
iv. Individual or organisational written submissions
were received by the Committee (Annexure
C).


##### THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE DEFENCE REVIEW


30. On reflection on its mandate, the independent Defence
Review Committee designed a nine-phase process to develop a
new South African Defence Policy. These phases are:
a. **Phase 1: A diagnostic and orientation process took**
place from July to October 2011.
i. A comprehensive assessment of the present
state of the Defence Force was made and
pressing defence issues were identified. In this
phase, 103 engagements took place with elements of the Defence Force, Government Departments and other identified stakeholders.
ii. A number of international bench-marking engagements took place and identified Defence
Force deployments were visited, both within
the borders of South Africa and at the external
mission areas.
iii. A comprehensive list of diagnostic engagements is found at Annexure B.
b. **Phase 2: During the first half of October 2011,**
the Committee reflected on its afore-mentioned
engagements and defined the fundamental defence


-----

_“The South African National Defence Force appreci-_
_ates the professional and cordial relationship it has with_
_the Defence Review Committee. The spirit of construc-_
_tive and robust engagement on the content of the Draft_
_South African Defence Review 2012 is welcomed by the_
_Military Command Council and we appreciate the op-_
_portunities it has been afforded to engage on the content_
_of the document.”_

**General S.Z. Shoke – Chief of the SA National**
**Defence Force**


g. **Phase 7: During late-July and throughout August**
2012, the Committee embarked on a process of
consolidating its work through:
i. Reflecting on the outcomes of the public engagements listed above and the submissions
received.


ii. Substantively reorganising and augmenting the
independent report, after due consideration
of the outcome of the public consultation and
evaluating the merits of all the submissions
received.
h. **Phase 8: Thereafter, the Committee prepared its**
final Defence Review Report for formal presentation to the Minister.
i. **Phase 9: Commencing in February 2013 the**
Committee assisted the Minister of Defence and
Military Veterans with driving the Defence Review
through the Executive and the Legislature approval
processes, including the development of adjustments to the document and focused presentations
for specific target groups.

became a vibrant democracy. It has a Constitution which outlaws discrimination, enshrines fundamental rights, and emphasises openness and accountability in the affairs of government.

2. This fundamental shift has been accompanied by a dramatic change in the strategic environment at domestic and regional levels. The salient fact is that the government is no longer
unrepresentative and at war with its own people and neighbouring states in Southern Africa. At national level the objectives of security policy therefore encompass the consolidation of
democracy; the achievement of social justice, economic development and a safe environment; and a substantial reduction in
the level of crime, violence and political instability. Stability and


development are regarded as inextricably linked and mutually
reinforcing.

3. The ending of apartheid and the establishment of democracy have given rise to dramatic changes to South Africa’s position in the external strategic environment. After two and a half
decades of isolation, South Africa has been welcomed back into
the international community and has joined a host of important
regional and international bodies. The country’s international
relations have been transformed from an adversarial mode to
bilateral and multi-lateral cooperation. The country is no longer isolated internationally. It has been welcomed into many international organisations, most importantly the United Nations
(UN), the African Union (AU) and the Southern African Development Community (SADC).

4. At an international level the objectives of South Africa’s
security policy include the defence of the sovereignty, territorial
integrity and political independence of the South African state,
and the promotion of regional security.


-----

5. Security is an all-encompassing condition in which individual citizens live in freedom, peace and safety; participate fully in
the process of governance; enjoy the protection of fundamental rights; have access to resources and the basic necessities of
life; and inhabit an environment which is not detrimental to their
health and well-being.

6. The defence focus in recent years was on the political
transition from apartheid to a democratic South Africa, and the
concomitant integration of diverse statutory and non-statutory
armed forces into a single Defence Force. The Constitution establishes a framework for democratic civil-military relations. In
terms of this framework the Defence Force is non-partisan; it is
subject to the control and oversight of the duly elected and appointed civilian authority; and it is obliged to perform its functions
in accordance with law.

7. The above is further outlined in Chapter 3 of this Defence
Review where the Defence and National Security Interface is
discussed more comprehensively.


11. Like much of the eastern part of the African continent,
South Africa’s landscape is dominated by a high plateau in the
interior, surrounded by a narrow strip of coastal lowlands. Unlike
most of Africa, the perimeter of South Africa’s inland plateau rises
abruptly to form a series of mountain ranges before dropping to
sea level. These mountains, known as the Great Escarpment,
vary between 2 000 meters and 3 300 meters in elevation. The
coastline is fairly regular and has few natural harbours. Each of
the dominant land features, the inland plateau, the encircling
mountain ranges, and the coastal lowlands, exhibits a wide range
of variation in topography, vegetation and natural resources.

12. South Africa’s climatic conditions generally range from
Mediterranean in the south-western corner of South Africa to
temperate in the interior plateau, and subtropical in the northeast. A small area in the north-west has a desert climate. Most
of the country has warm, sunny days and cool nights. Rainfall
generally occurs during summer (November through March),
although in the south-west, around Cape Town, rainfall occurs
in winter (June to August). Temperatures are influenced by variations in elevation, terrain, and ocean currents more than by
latitude.


##### GEOGRAPHY & TOPOGRAPHY


8. South Africa holds an important strategic position in the
world. Geographically, it is at the southern tip of Africa between
the Atlantic Ocean to the west and the Indian Ocean to the
east. Topographically, it has an extensive coastline with mountain
ranges separating the southern and eastern coastal plains from
the interior plateau. It contains large areas of arid semi-desert to
savannah in the north-west, with sub-tropical and tropical vegetation in the south-east and north-east of the country.

9. South Africa is a medium-sized coastal state and has a land
surface of 1 219 090 km[2]. Only 11% of this area is classified as
arable. The coastline as measured at the high water line is 3 924
km and the air border is 7 660 km. South Africa shares land borders with Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Swaziland and Lesotho totalling 4 471 km. Marion Island and Prince
Edward Island are 298 km[2] and 47 km[2] in extent, with coast lines
of 134 km and 32 km respectively.

10. South Africa has an economic exclusion zone of 1 553 000
km[2] of which the areas around Marion and Prince Edward Islands
comprise 474 400 km[2]. The Atlantic Ocean borders the west
coast, the Indian Ocean borders the east and south coast and the
Southern Ocean surrounds Marion and Prince Edward Islands.
South Africa has tabled its claim to the UN Convention on the
Law of the Sea for the extension of the continental shelf for the
purpose of securing additional resources. This implies that South
Africa will have to exercise control and enforce state authority
over 4 340 000 km[2] of maritime territory.

1 _Constitution, 1996: Section 202(1)._


##### FORM OF GOVERNMENT AND     LEGAL SYSTEM


###### FORM OF GOVERNMENT

13. South Africa is a constitutional state comprising an Executive President, a legislature consisting of a National Assembly and
a National Council of Provinces, and a Constitutional Court as
the highest court in the land. The President is the Commanderin-Chief of the Defence Force in terms of the Constitution[1].

14. A combination of proportional and constituency representation is used. The National and Provincial electoral systems
are based on proportional representation, whilst local elections
combine both a proportional representation with a ward representation. South Africa has been a constitutional democracy
since 1994. The bicameral Parliament consists of:
a. The National Council of Provinces (NCOP), which
has 90 seats with 10 members elected by each of the
nine provincial legislatures for five-year terms. The
NCOP has special powers to protect regional interests and safeguard cultural and linguistic traditions.
b. The National Assembly, which has 400 seats with
members elected by popular vote under a system
of proportional representation to serve five-year
terms. This is achieved through a system of party-list
proportional representation.


-----

15. After each parliamentary election, the National Assembly
elects one of its members as President; hence the President
usually serves a term of office the same as that of the Assembly,
normally five years. No President may serve more than two
terms in office. The President appoints a Deputy President and
Ministers, who form the Cabinet. The President and the Cabinet may be removed by the National Assembly by a motion of
no confidence.

16. South Africa has three capital cities: Cape Town is the seat
of Parliament and is the legislative capital; Pretoria is the seat of
the President and Cabinet and is the administrative capital; and
Bloemfontein is the seat of the Supreme Court of Appeal and is
the judicial capital.

###### LEGAL SYSTEM

17. South Africa has a mixed legal system of Roman-Dutch
law, English Common Law and Customary Law. The Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996, is the supreme law
of the Republic and provides the foundation for the rule of law.
The Constitution entrenches a comprehensive set of inalienable rights. These rights include, inter alia, the right to equality
before the law and equal protection and benefit of the law; to
be treated with dignity and respect; to freedom and security of
the person; to freedom of religion, belief and opinion; to freedom of expression; to freedom of association; and to peacefully
demonstrate.

18. South Africa has an independent judiciary and enjoys the
rule of law. Chapter 8 of the Constitution (1996) defines the
structure of the South African judicial system. This Chapter also
guarantees the independence of the courts and requires other
organs of the state to assist and protect the courts in order to
ensure their “independence, impartiality, dignity, accessibility and
effectiveness”. In addition, Chapter 2 of the Constitution guarantees every person the right to have a dispute or trial heard
by a fair, impartial and independent court. Courts comprise the
Constitutional Court, Supreme Court of Appeal, High Courts,
Magistrates’ Courts, and other courts established or recognised
in terms of an Act of Parliament. The Magistrates’ Courts hear
lesser criminal cases and smaller civil cases; the High Courts
are courts of general jurisdiction for specific areas; the Supreme
Court of Appeal is the highest court in all but constitutional matters; the Constitutional Court is the ‘apex’ court and hears constitutional and specific other matters.

###### ECONOMIC SYSTEM

19. South Africa is classified as a middle-income, emerging
economy, affluent in natural resources with well-developed
legal, communications, financial, energy and transport sectors.


Agriculture contributes 9% to the gross domestic product, with
industry and services contributing 26% and 65% respectively.

20. South Africa has by far the largest and most sophisticated
economy on the African continent. South Africa has the 25[th]
largest gross domestic product (GDP) in the world accounting
for 25% of Africa’s GDP and 33% of the sub-Saharan GDP, and
has been ranked as the 32[nd] largest importer and 37[th] largest
exporter. More than 50% of the economy is trade-related, with
mining, manufacturing, services and to a lesser degree agriculture as the mainstays of the economy. Most of the nine provinces have economies that are larger than most African states, with
the Gauteng province lying in third place to Egypt and Algeria.
The bulk of exports and imports are transported via sea lines of
communication with the Port of Durban, one of the busiest in
the Southern Hemisphere.

21. South Africa has the 18[th] largest stock exchange in the
world. The Rand is the most actively traded emerging-market
currency in the world and belongs to a distinguished group of 15
currencies that form the continuous linked settlement system,
where foreign currency transactions are settled immediately,
lowering the risk of transacting over time zones.

22. South Africa is ranked 121[st] in its economic growth. The
growth in the economy in recent times has been dramatically
reduced on the back of the economic challenges faced by South
Africa’s main trading partners. The economy is expected to
have a medium-term growth trajectory of 4% and a long-term
40-year growth average of 5%. South Africa has a relatively
small domestic customer base and economic growth is largely
reliant on growth in the exportation of goods and services.
a. South Africa’s global economic strategy remains
focused on Africa and on a strong developmental
agenda.
b. The value of trade in the SADC region has increased
substantially over the last decade and constitutes the
bulk of trade on the African continent. Botswana,
Zimbabwe, Kenya, Nigeria and Zambia are South
Africa’s largest trade partners in Africa.
c. South Africa has recently joined the Brazil, Russia,
India and China economic alliance (now BRICS),
positioning itself for new trade growth and market
access into the future.
d. The trade, development and cooperation agreement with the European Union is pivotal to economic development as well as contributing to South
Africa’s reconstruction and development agenda.
e. Germany, USA, Japan, UK, Italy, China, and Switzerland are amongst the top ten export destinations.
In South America, Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Mexico,
Colombia and Peru are the major trading partners.


-----

f. Trade with members of the South East Asian nations
has provided South Africa with a potential market of
520 million people and a 39% growth in exports to
the region.

23. South Africa’s economic infrastructure includes ten international airports and eight international seaports. These hubs
provide excellent connections for international travel and trade.
The number of containers moving via land, sea and air continues
to grow year on year.

24. Unemployment continues at high levels, in excess of 25%.
Domestically 33% of the labour force is employed in the informal economy, which traditionally is the sector that evades taxation and circumvents labour legislation. This informal sector has
grown by more than 7% in recent times. Analysis suggests that
the formal labour market is threatened by the high levels of illegal
immigration.

25. It is expected that Government will continue with financial reforms to ensure sound economic fundamentals to support
sustained growth.


e. Chemistry.
f. Information technology.

28. The Defence Force has been a major investor in science,
engineering and technology over the years and this has led to the
existing Defence Science Engineering and Technology (DSET)
capability which supports the Defence Force in a variety of ways
throughout defence system lifecycles and at all levels of the defence systems hierarchy.


##### PEOPLE AND SOCIETY


##### SCIENCE, ENGINEERING AND  TECHNOLOGY BASE


26. Among African and other nations at a similar stage of development, South Africa is unique in that it has a well-developed
science, engineering and technology (SET) base that supports
its broader industrial base. The SET base is further bolstered
by a well-developed Further Education and Training system that
produces the required human capital of engineers, technicians
and scientists that feed into the National System of Innovation.
Research and early technology development are well established
within the Universities and Universities of Technology. This research feeds into national research institutions like the Council
for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), where technology
is further developed to a level of readiness where it can be absorbed by industry and used in further research and development leading to product development.

27. South Africa possesses a number of specialised capabilities
in the public and the private sectors that have the potential to
maintain its position at the forefront of science and technology
on the continent, as well as to improve its standing in the world,
in various fields such as:
a. Nuclear fuel.
b. Aerospace technologies.
c. Safety and security, including defence.
d. Biotechnology including human and animal health.


29. Demographically South Africa comprises four major race
groupings that speak one or more of the eleven official languages. Over the last 15 years English has become the most common language for correspondence by government, the public
and business communities.

30. The approximately 50,6 million population of South Africa
consists of about 79.5% black (African) and 9.0% white (European), with about 9.0% people of mixed white and black descent (formerly called “Coloured”), and a small 2.5% minority of
South and East Asian background. Ten to fifteen percent of the
population may be illegal immigrants.

31. South Africa has eleven official languages, nine of which
are indigenous - isiZulu, isiXhosa, Setswana, Sesotho, Seswati,
Tshivenda, isiNdebele, Sepedi, and Xitsonga. Many South African people also speak Afrikaans[2] (the first language of about
60% of the whites and the majority of those of mixed race) or
English (the first language of most of the rest of the non-Africans).
About 80% of the population is Christian: major groups include
the African Instituted Churches, Pentecostal, Roman Catholic,
Methodist, Lutheran, Presbyterian, Dutch Reformed, and Anglican churches. There are smaller minorities of Muslims, Hindus,
Jews, and followers of African Traditional Religions.

32. Demographically, South Africa is a ‘young country’ with
a disproportionate youth bulge - two-thirds of the population
is under the age of 35 of which 50% is under the age of 15.
However, South Africa is expected to experience some significant changes over the next 20 years due to a slowing of the
population growth rate, with declining fertility rates and the impact of HIV/AIDS. A negative population growth rate is forecast
from 2040 onwards. An increasing gender-ratio of male to female is expected, as is a higher female mortality-rate due to HIV/
AIDS. Increasing proportions of black Africans relative to other
race groups and an ageing of the population as life expectancy
increases and the impact of HIV/AIDS declines, are expected[3].
Migration from rural to urban areas is expected to continue.


2 Afrikaans is recognised by the African Union as an indigenous African language.

##### SOUTH AFRICA AS A ‘DEMOCRAT- IC DEVELOPMENTAL STATE’


33. The commitment to constructing a ‘democratic developmental state’ is a recurring theme in government policy. Government has determined in its policy analysis of developmental
challenges facing the country that a ‘democratic developmental
state’ is able to intervene in order to meet national challenges,
including economic growth, unemployment, inequality, and
poverty. In this model, the State is interventionist, an agent of
development and takes up the mandate to accomplish national
development. This ‘democratic developmental state’ is characterised by state-led macro-economic planning and strong stateled intervention that focuses on addressing social and economic
challenges in society. Good governance and adherence to developmental values are crucial.

34. In seeking to establish South Africa as a democratic developmental state, Government wishes to influence the direction
and pace of economic and social development and to prioritise
and promote national development issues. This is characterised
by Government leading a strong, concerted drive for economic
growth and ensuring mobilisation of national resources towards
developmental goals. These may include:
a. Economic growth with development being prioritised through a sustained policy climate that fosters
productive investment, exports, growth and human
welfare.
b. Transformation of the economic base by promoting
productive, income-generating economic activities,
and by ensuring that economic growth has the effect
of improving the living conditions of the majority of
the population.
c. Policy having clearly defined socio-economic objectives, including, inter alia, “alleviation of absolute and
relative poverty, the correction of glaring inequalities
of social conditions ... and the tackling of looming
threats to environmental degradation”[4].
d. The organisational structures of the State being used
to promote and achieve better economic performance, with specific relation to surrounding social
structures.
e. The State using its capacity to promote and sustain
development - namely the combination of steady
and high rates of economic growth and structural
change in the productive system.
f. Coherent state agencies able to express and promote measurable developmental goals.
g. The State being embedded in a structure of alliances


and partnerships with key societal groups to facilitate
the achievement of its societal goals.

35. Furthermore, South Africa faces a pressing need to ‘prioritise the priorities’, such priorities being deeply rooted in the
vital national interests of the country, so that the developmental
agenda has a clear, finite set of identifiable objectives that are
supported by the concomitant effort of all stakeholders. This
requires institutional and organisational attributes that enable the
achievement of growth and development objectives, productive investment, exports, growth and human welfare. As such,
South Africa has developed innovative strategies to promote
social cohesion on:
a. A comprehensive, integrated and participatory antipoverty strategy, which promotes national unity,
shared value systems and citizen identity.
b. Sustainable solutions for the prioritised quality delivery of basic services, particularly to marginalised and
vulnerable groups.

36. The developmental agenda translated to the lives of all
South Africans seeks to manifest in:
a. Reduced levels of poverty.
b. Meaningful and sustainable jobs.
c. Living within safe & secure borders.
d. Benefit from good service delivery.
e. Benefit from global peace, stability, security & prosperity, especially on the African continent.

37. South Africa and the region continue to be stricken by
chronic underdevelopment, inadequate health services and the
attendant problems of poverty, illiteracy and unemployment.
These human security and developmental problems continue
to impact negatively on the region in the form of a range of nonmilitary threats, namely:
a. Endemic cycle between poverty and violence.
b. Marginalisation of vulnerable groups of society.
c. The spread of diseases.
d. The flow of refugees.
e. The illicit cross-border trafficking in drugs, goods,
small arms and light weapons.
f. Environmental destruction.

38. As such, “security is a prerequisite for development, and
there can be no development without commensurate security
– one of the primary contributions of Defence is, together with
other security departments, creating the security conditions for
development to take place”[4]. South Africa has conceptualised a
‘Human Security’ approach which identifies the need for a shift

in focus from solely securing the state by military means, to the
provision of security for its people by addressing critical political,
socio-economic and environmental problems.

###### POVERTY[5]

39. Poverty has many dimensions that shape people’s lives.
Poverty in South Africa is most evident in the lack of opportunities for economically active citizens to earn a wage. Income
poverty affects individuals and households in ways that are often
degrading and lead to precarious lifestyles. However, the linkages between income poverty and deprivations in health care,
education and social infrastructure are direct, with devastating
consequences for individuals and society. Deprivations in health
and education are also linked to a lack of access to other assets such as housing, land, social infrastructure (such as clinics,
schools, libraries and cultural resources) and services such as
credit facilities. Without access to quality health and education
and income-earning opportunities, the lives of the vast majority
of the poor wage a daily struggle to simply survive.

40. South Africa does not have a single official poverty line.
Government uses US$2 a day or R524 a month per person
(in 2008 prices, updated to 2010) as a rough guide. Using this
indicator, the proportion of people living below the poverty
line was about 53% in 1995; the figure subsequently varied,
reaching 58% in 2001 and declining to 48% in 2008. By international standards, this is a very high level of poverty. Poverty
among women-headed households is higher than the average
and women continue to earn less than men, even though differences in years of education have largely been narrowed. About
61% of women live in poverty, and 31% live in destitution,
compared with 39% and 18% of men respectively. The decline
in poverty since 1995 has been relatively small given rising per
capita income, a growing economy and significant social policy
interventions.

###### INCOME INEQUALITY[6]

41. There is good reason to be concerned about rising income inequality. Research shows that unequal societies tend to
do worse on a range of socioeconomic indicators, including life
expectancy, mental illness, obesity, educational performance,
teenage births, homicides, imprisonment rates, levels of trust
and social mobility. Other research shows strong relationships
between levels of inequality and violence and crime, as well as
the propensity for conflict and civil war. Inequality in South Africa
is reflected in the following ways:
a. In 1995, the poorest 20% of people earned an aver

age of R1 010 a year (in 2008 prices) and the richest
20% earned an average of R44 336 a year. In 2008,
the poorest 20% of people earned R1 486 a year
and the richest 20% earned an average of  R64 565
a year.
b. In 1995, the poorest 20% of the population earned
just 2.3% of national income, while the richest 20%
earned 72%. By 2008, these figures had barely
changed, with the poorest earning 2.2% of income
and the richest earning 70%.
c. In 1995, median per capita expenditure among Africans was R333 a month compared to whites at
R3 443 a month. In 2008, median expenditure per
capita for Africans was R454 a month, and for whites
R5 668 a month.

42. Within South Africa, extremely high unemployment and
underemployment have a particularly severe impact on those
under the age of 35. Millions of working-age adults are structurally unemployed and live in households with no income. As a
result, a great many South Africans depend on a relatively small
number of wage earners, so that most working people live in
poverty. The HIV/AIDS pandemic continues to take a tremendous toll. These factors, in combination with internal migration
from rural areas to urban centres, and increasing regional labour
migration, place pressure on limited social infrastructure and
state capabilities to provide essential services.

###### UNEMPLOYMENT[7]

43. Employment is one of the most effective ways of fighting
poverty, tackling inequalities and enabling people to improve
their quality of life. The lack of jobs is a major cause of poverty
and inequality.

44. Despite the improvement in job creation between 1997
and 2008, unemployment remains very high. Employment
increased from 11.1 million in 2001 to 13.6 million in 2008,
and declined thereafter as a consequence of the global recession (The Presidency 2009). One of the biggest challenges facing
South Africa today is that there is a very small number of working
people (41%) in the adult population. In addition, earnings from
work are low relative to the cost of living. High unemployment
results in high dependency ratios, with many people relying on
few wage earners. This results in a situation where the majority
of working families live near or below the poverty line.

45. At 25%, South Africa’s official rate of unemployment is ex

ceptionally high. The situation is even worse for young people.
Unemployed youth feel excluded and unable to contribute
positively to society. The lack of faster employment growth in
general, and in particular the inability of young people to break
into the labour market, undermines the country’s ability to unite
people around a common vision. Generally the economy has
been unable to absorb new job entrants. “In the first 15 years
of democratic rule the economy generated approximately 3.2
million jobs. Over the same period though, some 4.7 million
individuals entered the labour market, in search of jobs. The
consequence of the latter was an increase in the number of narrowly defined unemployed by 1.5 million”.

46. The inability of the economy to create jobs for young
people directly threatens the delicate balance between the constitutional imperative for redistribution, the need to escape the
shadow of the past, and the need to build inclusivity for all –
both black and white. Many young whites perceive the Employment Equity Act as exclusionary legislation. This is in spite of the
fact that statistics show that black workers take longer to be absorbed into the workforce, and are generally the first to be retrenched during a downturn. Black people generally experience
higher levels of unemployment and the participation of white
males is more or less unaffected by business cycle fluctuations.

47. Unemployment rates are higher for black youth than they
are for whites, especially at younger ages. Similarly, despite the
positive increase of women actively seeking employment, high
unemployment rates among women adds to social exclusion
and entrenches the poverty trap, especially when considering
the fact that many of the poorest households are headed by
women.

###### EDUCATION[8]

48. Education is a key factor in development. Good education provides access to the top end of the labour market and
facilitates social mobility, while poor education perpetuates the
skills shortage at the top end, causing a wage premium. The
large number of low-skilled workers depresses wages at the
bottom end. This combination contributes to the exceptionally
high level of income inequality in South Africa. Investment in
education is also important in developing responsive and active
citizens who can play a role in local governance, community
development and other local initiatives.

49. Education is one of the Millennium Development Goals
(MDGs) and features prominently in South Africa’s Constitution.
South Africa has implemented a number of progressive policies
to ensure a realisation of the MDGs. South Africa has done well


in extending access to education and has met MDG targets in
this regard. Education receives the single largest share of total
government expenditure. As a proportion of GDP, South Africa’s expenditure on education in 2010/11 will be 5.8% (R165
billion) up from 5.1% (R105 billion) in 2007/08.

50. About 1 million young people exit the schooling system
annually, of whom 65% exit without achieving a Grade 12 certificate (JET 2011a). Half of those who exit the schooling system
do so after Grade 11, either because they do not enrol in Grade
12 or they fail Grade 12. However, only a small number of those
who leave the schooling system enrol in Further Education and
Tranining (FET) colleges or have access to any post-school training. The net effect of this is that access to post-school education
and training is limited for school leavers.

###### CRIMINALITY[9]

51. Crime levels are high in South Africa. Violent crime, contact crime and property crime are so common that many South
Africans live in fear. When people feel unsafe it makes it harder
for them to pursue their personal goals, and to take part in social and economic activity. Feeling unsafe can result from having
been a victim of crime, knowing people who have been victims
of crime, or hearing crime reported in the community or the
media.

52. A 2010 study by the Centre for Study of Violence and
Reconciliation (CSVR) shows that, although violent crimes take
place in all settings, it is predominant in metropolitan areas. Major forms of violent crimes identified include: assaults linked to
arguments, anger and domestic violence; rape and sexual assault; and robbery and other violent property crime. According to the crime statistics for the period April 2009 to March
2010, the largest number (31.9%) of all 2.1 million crimes were
contact crimes, followed by property crimes (26.1%) and other
serious crimes (25.5%). Although there has been a decline in
murders, the high proportion of contact crimes is bound to raise
fears among citizens.

53. In discussing crime, there is always the danger of focusing
too much on policing as a solution. There is no doubt that more
visible policing gives citizens a sense of protection, but reducing crime will require a combination of interventions, including
those originating from outside the criminal justice system. The
speed with which the police investigate and arrest perpetrators,
and how effectively the prosecution is carried out by the criminal justice system, are critical to how safe citizens feel.

54. The National Prosecuting Authority has reported an increase in the percentage of convictions, from 80% in 1999/00
to 85.9% in 2007/08, and a reduction in the number of cases
withdrawn from 414 211 in 2002/03 to 225 407 in 2007/08.
However, the high number of cases that are withdrawn affects
citizens’ confidence in the criminal justice system.

55. The CSVR study identifies the following factors as sustaining the culture of crime: (1) inequality, poverty, unemployment,
social exclusion and marginalisation; (2) perceptions and values
relating to violence and crime; (3) the vulnerability of youth,
linked to inadequate child rearing and inappropriate socialisation;
and (4) weaknesses in the criminal justice system.

56. The six pillars of violence prevention (WHO 2002, cited in
Matzopolous 2011) are: investing in early interventions, increasing positive adult involvement, strengthening communities, challenging social norms that entrench violence, reducing income
inequality, and improving criminal justice and social welfare. An
effective, integrated strategy is needed to address the pervasive
problem of violence.

###### SKEWED LAND DISTRIBUTION AND SOUTH AFRICA’S AGRI-POTENTIAL

57. South Africa’s rural space is wracked by a triptych of policies that reach back to the union of the country at the turn of
the previous century. The Land Act of 1913 and its successors
separated black from white farmers, communal lands from private property, and in many cases individuals from their families;
the ‘betterment’ process in the former homelands separated
black people from their means of sustenance; and the Marketing
Act of 1937 became the main cause of the flight of rural nonfarm business from the white platteland with its favouring of big
farms and big business over small and of the urban over the rural
economy. Until these overlapping distortions are recognised and
addressed, rural job creation and the creation of an environment
that will support rural entrepreneurs, whether on or off-farm,
remains a chimera[10].

58. The current economic structure of South Africa, as a result
of this historical process and phenomenon, has produced, and
continues to produce, net factors which combine to undermine
the creation of conditions which are conducive to fostering social


cohesion and development amongst those historically dispossessed of their land[11]. An improved land reform trajectory[12] has
been mooted in the Green Paper on Land Reform which attempts to:
a. Improve on past and current land reform perspectives, without significantly disrupting agricultural production and food security; and,
b. avoid or minimise land redistribution and restitution
which do not generate sustainable livelihoods, employment and incomes.

59. While achieving equitable distribution of land remains a
fundamental policy of government, there is an even more urgent
need to ensure that land reform is measured not only through
equity but also through productivity, leading to enhanced food security for all, job creation and skills training among beneficiaries[13].

60. The potential for agri-transformation and the development
of sustainable agri-businesses in South Africa remains significant.
South Africa currently cultivates about 13 million ha of agricultural land, while available arable land amounts to approximately
15 million ha; some 2 million ha are available for expansion of
agricultural production, mostly in the former homeland areas.
Furthermore, South Africa has the potential to irrigate a conservatively estimated further 500 000 ha of land within a 20-year
planning horizon, or an expansion of a third over the current
area[14].

61. As a result, it has been estimated that more than 300 000
employment opportunities can be created in the communal areas among those households that already have access to land,
and that the stimulation of industries within agriculture (in the
communal and the commercial farming areas) with a proven
track record of growth and employment creation can potentially
create almost 200 000 on-farm jobs. The industries with the
largest potential contribution to the creation of jobs are citrus,
avocadoes, vegetables, macadamia and pecan nuts, and olives.
Furthermore, the less labour-intensive field crop and livestock
industries can also contribute to employment creation. Finally,
the creation of employment opportunities in primary agriculture
will stimulate the creation of at least half as many jobs in those
industries that supply the means of production to farmers, and
that take farm produce from the farm and turn it into consumable products at the time and place, and in the form, desired by
consumers[15].

## THE STRATEGIC ENVIRONMENT


##### INTER-STATE AND INTRA-STATE DIMENSIONS OF CONFLICT


###### INTRODUCTION

1. As the world becomes more complex and more unstable,
and as it consequently presents increased risks to both international and domestic security and conflict, it is useful to identify
the expanding spectrum of conflict that is evident in the global
security environment. This spectrum of conflict is best understood in terms of both its inter-state (between states) and intrastate (within a state) dimensions.

###### INTER-STATE CONFLICT

2. Large-scale inter-state conflict is currently constrained by


the interdependency of economies, international security cooperation within established alliances and the multilateral mechanisms established for the prevention and resolution of conflict.
Although this growing interdependency among countries helps
deter inter-state conflict, there remains competitive demand
among all nations for raw materials and strategic resources,
compounded by the quest for power, dominance and influence.
This will thus continue to trigger inter-state disputes and regional
conflicts, similarly undermining global multilateral institutions established to regulate world order and peace.

3. Conflict along ideological lines has largely been superseded by conflict motivated by the economic interests of states, and
for which both major combat and asymmetrical capabilities are
utilised. The potential spectrum of inter-state conflict that may
manifest is indicated below in Figure 2-1.


-----

_�������������������������������_

###### INTRA-STATE CONFLICT 

4. The vast majority of armed conflicts occur within states,
rather than between them. Such intra-state conflicts will continue to feature prominently in the underdeveloped and developing worlds, due to reasons including political intolerance,

competition for resources,
ineffective governance,
corruption, extreme poverty and underdevelopment. Territory that lacks
proper governance and
infrastructure further tends
to provide safe-havens for
criminals, terror-groupings,
armed guerrillas and armed
insurgents.


effects on neighbouring states.
At the same time neighbouring states can, and often do,
become involved in an intrastate conflict, giving rise to regional disputes.

6. Furthermore, various
international flashpoints remain unresolved and continue to generate instability in
their respective regions. Iraq,
Afghanistan, the Sahel region,
the African Great Lakes and
Somalia continue to experience intra-state conflict. The
conflict in the Middle East
between Israel and Palestine
remains unresolved, as do
tensions around the nuclear
ambitions of certain states.

7. The potential spectrum
of intra-state conflict that may

manifest is indicated below in Figure 2-2.

8. It is significant to note that merely a century ago, 90% of
casualties in conflicts were male soldiers. In today’s conflicts, the
majority of the casualties are civilians, and 75% of these are estimated to be women and children. This is indicative of the trend


5. Although occurring
within states, intra-state
conflicts also negatively affect inter-state relations. The
consequences of such conflicts in terms of displacedpersons, refugees, the trafficking of small arms and light
weapons, and the disruption
of transport hubs and trade
will have profound spill-over

away from major combat operations to asymmetrical activities where the population
is placed at risk and is increasingly vulnerable.

##### THE STRATEGIC IMPORTANCE OF AFRICA

###### AFRICA’S STRATE- GIC IMPORTANCE

9. Africa is strategically
important for three main reasons: firstly, its geo-strategic
position - there are five maritime choke points adjacent
to the continent, namely the
Strait of Gibraltar, the Suez
Canal, the Gulf of Aden, the
Mozambique Channel and
the Cape of Good Hope


_Figure 2-3: Africa’s Major Sea Routes_


(Figure 2-3); secondly, it
possesses vital resources,
especially strategic minerals, oil and gas; and thirdly
it has the agrarian capacity
to expand and influence
global food production.

10. Fifty percent of Africa’s oil is produced in the
Gulf of Guinea off West
Africa, with the rest mainly in North Africa and
some in the east. The
main West African producers are Nigeria, Angola and Equatorial Guinea. Southern and Central
Africa is regarded as the
main mineral depository
of the world, including
rare and valuable minerals such as coltan (75% of
world stock in the DRC),
platinum in South Africa and Zimbabwe, and
uranium in South Africa,
Namibia and the DRC
(Figure 2-4).


_Figure 2-4: Distribution of African Natural Resources_


-----

_Figure 2-5: Agrarian Production in Africa_

11. Notwithstanding the predominance of subsistence-based
agricultural activity and the very limited large-scale commercial
agricultural production in Africa (Figure 2-5), the agrarian potential of the continent is significant, especially given growing
global food insecurity. Sub-Saharan Africa in particular has all
the basic elements required for sustainable commercial agricul

ture production should this be
harnessed through commercial
agri-businesses. A number of African countries in the sub-region
individually have the potential
to provide most of Africa’s food
requirements.

12. In addition to Africa’s significant oil and gas deposits, Africa has the potential to provide
significant alternative energy in
the future, some of these being
hydro-electricity, bio-fuels, and
solar and wind energy. The distribution of the main water basins is
indicated in (Figure 2-6).

###### PERSISTENT CON- FLICT AND INSTABIL- ITY HAMPER AFRI- CAN DEVELOPMENT

13. Africa’s vulnerability to
socio-economic deprivation,
armed conflict and political instability hampers its growth and
development. Human security
in a number of African countries
thus remains precarious. A constant high level of instability exists

in various parts of Africa that emanates from (inter alia): lack of
political rights; weak and dysfunctional states; inadequate political
and economic governance; border and territorial disputes; conflict over scarce resources; the politicisation of ethnicity (Figure
2-7); religious extremism; the marginalisation of groups; the inappropriate involvement of the military in political and economic


-----

_Figure 2-6: Key Water Basins in Africa_

affairs; unconstitutional changes of governments; and maritime
crime and piracy. In addition, advancing climate change, poverty
and disease continue to exacerbate the social and economic vulnerability of many communities.

14. This humanitarian situation is evident from the plight of
refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs) and food riots


in some African countries. Conflict and hardship, and the resulting displaced populations, will remain an important trigger for
migration to other regions and countries, including South Africa.

15. While Africa has experienced relatively few inter-state
conflicts in recent years, various intra-state conflicts continue to
have a wide-ranging impact on inter-state relations, mainly be

-----

cause of refugees, cross-border crime and support to insurgent
groups from neighbouring countries. Some of these conflicts are
based on longstanding disputes, while others have recent origins
and are exacerbated by ineffective governance, the politicisation
of ethnicity and the legacy of colonial borders (Figure 2-7).

16. From 1997 to 2012[2] over 65 000 conflict events have
been recorded in Africa (Figure 2-8) with the following breakdown: 40% are battles between governments, rebels, and militias; 34% are events in which civilians are directly targeted and
harmed; 18% are riots and protests; and 7.5% is non-violent
activity including rebel recruitment, arrests or base establish

_Figure 2-7: National Borders and_
_Ethnic Boundaries[1]_

ment. From 1997 to 2012, riots, protests and violence against
civilians have increased, while the frequency of violent battles
has decreased.

##### DRIVERS OF GLOBAL AND AFRICAN INSECURITY

17. Both the international and the continental strategic environments are extremely fluid and likely to remain so for the foreseeable future. This is a factor of both national actors and nonstate groups - ideological, political and criminal - playing varying
roles that have the potential to impact on stability and security.

-----

The result is an ever-evolving palette of potential challenges,
risks and threats that can directly or indirectly affect Africa, but
more specifically, Southern Africa. Recent acts of terror in parts
of Africa and the escalation and spread of maritime criminality in
African waters are merely two examples of this.

###### AN INEQUITABLE BALANCE OF GLOBAL POWER

18.  Conflict and war have mostly been the result of states
pursuing their interests to the detriment and insecurity of others. The global balance of power and the global structures that
give effect to it are undemocratic, inequitable and in many cases
inimical to the interests of the developing world.


_Figure 2-8: Continental ‘Hotspots’_

19. Furthermore, globalisation (being characterised by increased economic, cultural, social and political global interdependence) has not brought the expected reduction of geopolitical,
religious, ethnic or ideological struggles. It has rather contributed to the growing economic disparity between the richest and
poorest countries. This inequality gap will be a source of tension
and potential conflict, being particularly acute in Africa, especially
in those African countries which are either not well integrated
into the world economy or which have weak or failing governance structures.

20. In the next decade there will be important challenges to
the current balance of power. Examples include:


-----

a. The economic growth of emerging powers with
increased leverage, driven by the demands of their
growing populations.
b. Growing regional collaboration, such as in Europe,
Africa and the Americas.
c. Emerging multilateral alliances, characterised by the
emerging significance of the Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa (BRICS) countries.

###### THE CAPACITY OF STATES FOR UNILAT- ERAL ACTS OF FORCE

21. Although political and economic integration has made
progress in recent years, states jealously guard their national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and will continue to secure and
protect these through the maintenance of powerful military capabilities. Significantly, military power continues to be exercised

_Figure 2-9: Belts of Minerals & Scarce Resources in Sub-Saharan Africa_


alongside both economic and political power.

22. While most states in the post-Cold War era have reduced
their military spending, some have strengthened and expanded
their conventional capacity, allowing traditional major powers to
sustain their military dominance. Accordingly, military strength
continues to provide powerful states with the means to embark
on unilateral acts of force and even armed aggression in pursuit
of their own national interests. The military capacity of the major
powers and certain regional groupings is unlikely to be contested
in the near future.

23. Moreover, such acts in violation of the territorial integrity
and sovereignty of states are undertaken against the basic tenets
of international law and the fabric of collective security mechanisms, such as the UN system. South Africa and its people are
not immune from such international security dynamics.

###### THE SCRAMBLE FOR ENERGY, MINERALS AND SCARCE RESOURCES

24. The global security environment is significantly influenced by
the competition for strategic resources, in particular energy products such as oil, gas and strategic
minerals that are essential for hightechnology industries. Rapid population growth in some developing
economies and growing consumption in the developed world will
increase competition for energy,
water, minerals and land.

25. Energy markets will be exposed to short-term fluctuations in
supply and delivery. Import-dependent countries with weak economies will be especially vulnerable.
Tensions and even conflict could
possibly arise between states pursuing control over dwindling supplies. Securing access to energy,
food, water and strategic minerals


-----

_Figure 2-10: Incidence of Piracy_

will continue to remain a global priority, with both state and
non-state actors playing increasingly prominent roles in African
security affairs.

26. Oil production on the African continent has increased in
recent years, thereby stimulating competition for this strategic
resource. Africa will remain a major source of raw materials and
strategic minerals for foreign powers and corporations (Figure
2-9).

27. Of particular concern is the exchange of arms for strategic
minerals and the risk of military intervention to secure access
to these resources. On a positive note, foreign involvement in
sourcing the continent’s raw materials could lead to investment,


job creation, economic growth
and prosperity. Some countries
have altruistic motives and try
to alleviate poverty and suffering on the continent.

###### MARITIME INSECURITY

28. The substantial increase in
acts of maritime crime along Africa’s coastline threatens the security and stability of the continent. Both the SADC Maritime
Security Strategy (MSS) and
the African Integrated Maritime
Strategy 2050 (AIMS-2050)
recognise the threat to human
security arising from acts of
maritime piracy and criminality.

29. Although the current piracy hotspots are off the east and
west coasts of Africa, namely
the Gulf of Aden and the Gulf
of Guinea (Figure 2-10), pirates
have extended their activities
to over 1 100 km offshore and
have moved into Seychelles and
Tanzanian waters, even reaching the Indian coast. Somali pirates have operated as far south
as the Mozambique Channel
and as far east as 72[o] East towards the Maldives. As a direct

consequence of the piracy along the east coast, many shipping
companies have had to use the Cape Sea Route instead of the
Suez Canal.

30. The Southern African region also faces the challenge of
ensuring maritime security, specifically combatting piracy and
the smuggling of weapons, contraband, people and goods. Of
particular importance is the protection of maritime trade and
resources, including fisheries, seabed minerals and energy resources. These maritime threats are primarily trans-national
and trans-oceanic, thus requiring the capabilities for surveillance
over the sea and for effecting search and seizure at sea. Many
littoral states, however, lack the capacity to monitor their maritime areas.


-----

31. South Africa’s geographical location can be characterised as
a medium-sized coastal state. South Africa has a coastline of almost 3 924 km on a strategic international maritime trade route,
with international obligations for providing safety of navigation
and ships, ensuring freedom of the seas and security of shipping
and the marine environment.

32. South Africa has in essence an ‘island economy’ that is almost totally dependent on maritime transport. The bulk of the
country’s GDP is generated through trade, with 90% of exports
and imports being transported by sea (Figure 2-11). As such
South Africa has an “obligation to cooperate with other maritime
nations to uphold the freedom of the seas and to protect its
national interests”[3].

33. Recent maritime
security incidents, together with requests
from foreign governments and multilateral organisations, have
compelled South Africa
to respond to such security threats. This requires domestic law to
be aligned with international conventions and
treaties, and thus harmonised within South
African domestic law,
the SADC region and
on the African continent
in order to prosecute
transgressors. This matter remains urgent.

###### ACTS OF TERROR

34.  Acts of terror
have become less territorially defined and
more global. No country can be considered
immune from international acts of terror that
are difficult to counter


owing to the international networks involved, and which may be
perpetrated by individuals not affiliated to a specific country or
group, but to an ideological cause.

35.  On the African continent, acts of terror by diverse militant
extremist groups remain a threat, at present in mainly North,
East and West Africa. These include Al Qa’eda in the Islamic
Maghreb (AQIM), al-Shabaab in Somalia, Boko Haram in Nigeria, and to a lesser extent the Movement for the Emancipation
of the Niger Delta and the Lord’s Resistance Army. Al Shabaab
and Boko Haram have been the most violent armed groups in
Africa in recent years[4]. This is reinforced by the number of fatalities that can be attributed to both groups. While Boko Haram
is responsible for far more fatalities per event than Al Shabaab,


_Figure 2-11: South Africa’s Major Trade Routes_

4 The Armed Conflict Location Dataset & Event Database: Which Groups Were the Most Violent in 2012? at http://www.acleddata.com.


-----

this is in part due to how Al Shabaab uses unidentified groups to
perpetrate much of its violence against civilians.

36. Increased security at military and strategic facilities will
drive extremists to attack ‘softer’ targets such as private citizens
and commercial interests. Terror incidents will tend to occur in
urban centres, often capitals. The characteristics of effective terror organisations make them difficult intelligence targets. Countering acts of terror will remain a prime focus of major powers’
security policies.

###### WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION AND OTHER LETHAL WEAPONS

37. The threat posed by Weapons of Mass Destruction
(WMDs[5]), including Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) weapons, is of enduring concern. Major role players regard the proliferation of WMDs and their delivery systems
as a priority threat. Proliferation of WMDs is evident in certain
states that have not signed or do not adhere to international
control treaties.

38. Nuclear conflict between two evenly matched powers
is unlikely in the near future, but not impossible.  Miscalculation in regional crises or the actions of a belligerent state could
spark conflict that could plunge several military powers into war.
In addition, the use of a radiological device, or so-called “dirty
bomb”, is probably the most serious WMD threat posed by
non-state groups. International efforts pursue the control of
WMDs, delivery systems, supplies of fissionable matériel, chemical precursors and biological agents. The international focus is
on preventing newcomers (state and non-state) from attaining
WMDs. Much less success is being attained in reducing present
WMD stocks. International attention will thus focus on potential
nuclear transgressors.

39. The globalisation of technology is leading to the diffusion
of military technology. Advantages will accrue to states with the
adaptability to link civilian technologies successfully to defence
programmes, and the foresight to anticipate future warfare requirements accurately. Free trade in weapons and easy global
migration of skilled military and scientific personnel can result
in countries rapidly acquiring a strategic aggressive capacity. At
the same time, technology and highly competitive arms markets
result in weapons that are less expensive, more portable, destructive, widely available and easier for non-state actors to use.

40. The possibility of non-state actors, such as terror groups,
acquiring WMDs is strong, as this matériel and technology be

come more readily available. Chemical and biological weapons
are generally easier to develop, hide and deploy than nuclear
weapons. Chemical and biological weapons could well be used
in a regional conflict or a terror attack.

###### NON-STATE ACTORS

41. Most conflicts in Africa over the last ten years have involved rebel and armed groups opposing governments by
means of guerrilla warfare. This has been characterised at times
by external state-sponsored support to non-state actors, and
internal state-sponsored violence for political ends. These rebel
groups may consist of warlords, militias, paramilitary groups,
armed guerrillas, terror organisations, religious extremists and
insurgents. They rely mainly on small arms and light weapons
already available, or on private companies and individuals who
supply them with first and second-generation weapons.

42. Their modus operandi is to establish safe base areas in remote parts of a country or in a neighbouring state, where there
is no effective administrative or security presence. From there
they expand the territory under their control and establish their
own administration to enable them to obtain revenue through
‘taxes’ and the exploitation of natural resources. Logistic supply
systems are rudimentary and consist mainly of pillaging from the
local population and living off the land.

43. Their military focus areas, apart from territorial expansion,
are the disruption of, inter alia, road and rail communication
lines, economic ventures that supply the government with revenue, urban centres and ultimately the national capital. Control
over airfields that can be used for logistic supply and the export
of exploited natural resources is an important prerequisite for
success.

###### MERCENARIES AND PRIVATE SECURITY COMPANIES

44. The participation of mercenaries and private security
companies in armed conflicts is controversial, especially when
military services are provided in violation of international law or
to sustain illegitimate regimes. Attempts to address this issue are
complicated by the difficulty of achieving a universal and concise definition of mercenarism (as opposed to the legal activities
of private security companies). Notwithstanding, mercenarism
is understood to be a manifestation of unregulated foreign security assistance and has the potential to undermine legitimate
governments.


5 WMDs are generally grouped into nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological capabilities.


-----

45. A further complicating factor is the increasingly blurred relationship between military and non-military aspects of conflict
resolution. As more comprehensive approaches to conflict resolution are adopted, it is expected that private security companies
will in future undertake a wider range of activities, some of which
were until recently carried out by armed forces and official military personnel.

46. Properly regulated private security companies may indeed
have a force-multiplication value[6] in certain situations. This may
include theatres such as peace missions where, for example,
civilian contractors may provide services such as logistical support, weapons maintenance, sanitation and even training to ex
combatants during their
integration into national
defence forces.


countries to operate in conflict zones, usually protecting prominent individuals, critical infrastructure, property and strategic
resources. Such private security companies may employ both
South Africans and non-South Africans and may also possess significant arms and ammunition.

48. The challenge to the South African Government remains
the effective regulation of South African private security companies and to ensure that their activities are not inconsistent with
law or regulation and to enforce compliance therewith. South
Africa’s initial attempt to regulate this industry was through the
Regulation of Foreign Military Assistance Act, 1998 (Act No 15
of 1998).

49. However it became apparent that this legislation lacked
adequate substance. Consequently the Prohibition of Mercenary Activities and Regulation of Certain Activities in Country of
Armed Conflict Act (Act No 27 of 2006) was assented to by the
President in 2007. Although the Act has been assented to the
President has not brought it into force pending the development
of the Regulations thereto.

###### CLIMATE CHANGE AND NATURAL DISASTERS

50. The consequences of climate change (Figure 2-12) pose
some of the most serious threats to humanity, including an increase in the frequency and severity of floods, hurricanes, cyclones and wildfires. Prolonged droughts and rising desertification may cripple food production and increase famine. Climate
change will over time also result in rising sea levels, threatening
low-lying areas and certain island states. Tectonic events, including volcanic eruptions and earthquakes that could result in tsunamis, are ever-present environmental risks that could result in
major humanitarian disasters. While Southern Africa is geologically stable, other parts of Africa such as the Rift Valley and North
Africa are more exposed to such events.

51. Climate change in the SADC context can be expected
to manifest in floods and droughts, resulting in SADC Member States seeking assistance within the region. The continent

_Figure 2-13: Human Development Index 2012_


generally lacks civil capacity to manage disasters and will continue to rely on defence capabilities for disaster management.
As weather patterns become more erratic and natural disasters
more frequent, South Africa must possess both the technical
expertise and hardware to render assistance within SADC. The
Defence Force would in particular be expected to maintain a
capacity to play a significant supportive role in addressing the
consequences of such events.

###### POVERTY, UNDERDEVELOPMENT AND POOR HUMAN SECURITY

52. Of the 39 countries worldwide that are currently facing
food emergencies, 23 are in Africa. Population growth and increases in consumption on the continent will continue to strain
the ability of poorer nations to alleviate conditions of poverty
and underdevelopment. It is estimated that the population of
Sub-Saharan Africa will exceed 1.3 billion by 2035 and that 45%
of the continent’s population will live in urban areas by 2015,
increasing to 54% by 2025[7]. The implication will be increasing
overpopulation and substantial growth in unplanned and random informal settlements within and around urban areas.

53. In addition much of Africa and the SADC region continue
to be stricken by chronic underdevelopment, inadequate health
services and the attendant problems of poverty, illiteracy and
unemployment (Figure 2-13). These human security and devel

opmental problems continue
to impact negatively on the
region in the form of a range
of non-military threats, namely:
the spread of diseases; the flow
of refugees; the illicit cross-border smuggling in drugs, goods,
small arms and light weapons;
and environmental destruction[8]. This feeds the endemic
cycle between poverty and
violence.

54. Overpopulation and human settlement trends will
have significant implications for
defence forces. The increasing
number of armed combatants
and unarmed non-combatants
in a combat zone will add significantly to the complexity of
undertaking successful military
operations. It is also likely that
unregulated urbanisation will
result in future adversaries having urban survival and combat
skills. Consequently, they might
choose to pursue their objectives and conduct operations
in sprawling towns and cities
which will already have experienced endemic lawlessness
and high levels of violence[9].

###### FOOD SECURITY Figure 2-14: Impact of Climate Change on Agrarian Activities

57. The Continent must
progress towards largescale farming practices and
the establishment of sustainable agri-businesses in
order to meet future food
production demands.

###### ENDEMIC DISEASE

58. Pandemics and outbreaks of communicable diseases will continue to have a
significant impact on human
development. Health is a
key driver in social stability
(Figure 2-15). The deterioration in the health status or
the perceived health status
of a community can stimulate social upheaval.

59. Like many middleincome countries, South
Africa has to grapple simultaneously with the diseases
of poverty and affluence,
but the inequalities in access to health care mean
that relatively more is spent
on the diseases of affluence.
Supportive measures to


_Figure 2-15: Major Disease Incidences in Africa – August 2014[12]_


enhance health, such as ensuring safe drinking water, effective
sewage processing plants and control over vector diseases, are
inadequate[10]. This places an increasing burden on mainly the
public health infrastructure, but also on the military health infrastructure in the country.

60. A quadruple health burden[11] undermines the social wellbeing of the South African community, including the military
community. These are the pandemic of HIV/AIDS; the increasing injury patterns of both accidental and non-accidental injuries;
outbreaks of communicable diseases including re-emerging diseases (such as tuberculosis, diarrhoea and pneumonia, which
interact in vicious negative feedback loops with malnutrition and
HIV); and the growing incidence of lifestyle diseases related to
affluence.


###### LARGE SCALE POPULATION MOVEMENT AND MIGRATION

61. Conflict in Africa is generally of low intensity, but is extensive and destructive. This is especially evident from the large
number of refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs),
of which Africa (with 15% of world population) has 20% and
40% respectively of the world total[13]. Conflicts in the Maghreb,
Chad, Eastern DRC, Somalia and Sudan, as well as an increase
in political violence and unconstitutional changes of power in
some countries, are important causes of migration.

62. South Africa remains a destination of choice for many foreign migrants because of real and perceived opportunities and
stability, in contrast to the instability and deprivation in other

13 The number of IDPs in Africa remains stable at 11,6 million. Sudan has the largest number of IDPs of about 4,9 million. Other countries with large
numbers of IDPs are the DRC and Somalia, with 1,9 million and 1,5 million respectively. Refugees in Africa total 2,1 million, a decline from 3,4 million
in 2000. Kenya has the largest refugee population of 360 000, followed by Chad with 314 000.

areas of the continent. The irregular migration to South Africa and the attendant smuggling
of humans and other goods
have critical domestic security
implications, particularly as they
relate to linkages with extremist
organisations and the furtherance of the illicit economies of
Southern Africa. Porous borders are exploited by those
intent on cross-border crime,
particularly: arms proliferation;
drug trafficking; vehicle smuggling; the smuggling of precious
stones, metals, ivory and endangered species; and the illegal importation of cigarettes,
clothing, alcoholic beverages
and other goods. Key migratory
trends are indicated in Figure
2-16.

63. Many migrant populations
engage in a range of illicit and
illegal activities, out of which
some formal businesses grow.

jor challenges (to the developing world) in terms of governance,
fiduciary arrangements and international financial regulation[14].

66. Africa’s peace, security, stability and development are similarly being undermined by trans-national crime that targets the
trafficking in small arms, light weapons, contraband, drugs and
humans, as well as both being the base of certain terror groups
and the target of their activities. As example, Africa has seen the
emergence of two syndicated phenomena, namely illegal mining and illegal bunkering of crude oil, including illegal gold mining
in South Africa and illegal oil bunkering in the Niger Delta and
the Gulf of Guinea.

67. The regional dimension of the illicit economy is also a
cause for concern. Factors that have allowed for the illicit economy to thrive in the region are mainly illegal migration, inadequate border controls, a lack of capacity to enforce existing legislation, corruption amongst border officials, criminal networks
operating across borders to facilitate illicit economic activity, and
a misalignment of regulatory frameworks (Figure 2-17).

68. South African society has been persistently affected by
crime, especially violent crime. Major forms of violent crimes
identified include assaults linked to arguments, anger and domestic violence; rape and sexual assault; robbery and other
violent property crime[15]. Although violent crime constitutes
a relatively small percentage of total criminal activity in South
Africa, it has undeniably affected the morale of the population
and the productivity of the economy. The trio of serious violent
crimes (residential and business robberies and vehicle hijacking)
and organised crime will continue to be a security challenge, as
criminal syndicates continuously adapt to law enforcement action by shifting their focus to other forms of criminal activity. The
incidence of violent crime continues to be exacerbated by the
availability of illicit arms in the hands of criminals.

69. Large-scale drug-trafficking continues to be the most visible
form of serious organised crime. South Africa has been identified as a regional hub and transit zone for illicit drugs. There has
been a marked increase in the flow of drugs into South Africa in
recent years, with international syndicates playing a prominent
role in this regard. Substance abuse, particularly drug use, is a
key factor driving youth-based crime in South Africa.

70. The illicit economy must be addressed; as it is estimated
that South Africa’s economy is losing 10% of its GDP to illicit
trade in areas like mining, tobacco and textiles[16]. Economic
crime is widespread by sector, particularly in finance, manufac

turing, mining, retail, and government procurement and tenders. A broad typology of economic crime includes trade in
arms, drugs and humans; counterfeiting; smuggling; corruption;
trade in contraband; fraud; money laundering and tax evasion.

71. Social protest and disruptive industrial action have been on
the increase, accompanied by an increase in levels of violence.
Protest and strike action have often turned violent, threatening
stability in parts of the country. In general, causes of riots and
demonstrations are extremely diverse: there is no single-issue
driver of protests and demonstrations, although a large share of
events are concerned with various work and industry-related
strikes and stoppages. Most incidents of violence against civilians
are typically linked to demonstrations and riots, either through
participants in demonstrations targeting nearby, unarmed civilians, or police forces engaging protesters[17].

72. Growing dissatisfaction associated with service delivery
will continue to cause major disruptions, threaten the stability of
some communities and possibly the country, and jeopardise the
provision of essential services. In general, the underlying causes
of protest action include income inequality, unemployment and
poverty. This is compounded by the prices of food and energy.

73. Intolerance and violence against foreign nationals remain
a concern, but cannot be linked to any single causal factor. It is
rather the result of a combination of factors, several of which
can be linked to competition over scarce resources and the
accompanying dynamics of human behaviour. Other causes of
anti-foreigner violence in South Africa include entrenched negative perceptions and stereotypes about foreigners, business
rivalry, criminality, population density and pressure on scarce
resources, particularly where perceptions of relative deprivation are sharpened by high unemployment and strong migratory
pressure.

74. Youth unemployment plays a prominent role in both protest action and in attacks against foreign nationals. The epicentres of protest are areas where inequality is highest, with high
population pressure and higher-than-average levels of unemployment. Capacity problems, mismanagement of resources,
corruption in local government and economic stresses from
the recession and its consequent job losses increase socio-economic pressures in communities. Particularly significant within
the domestic context is the spiralling violence within communities, in particular gender-based violence accentuated by growing
levels of poverty, disease and the marginalisation of vulnerable
groups of society.

###### CYBER-SECURITY

75. Cyber-security is an everpresent concern for all spheres
of South African society. Reports on violations of information systems and infrastructure
litter the information landscape,
with commerce, banking, government and private information having fallen victim to the
perpetrators of cyber-crime.
The threat exists in an environment that is rapidly evolving and changing, specifically
with significant amounts of personal information being freely
available on social networking
sites. It involves four discrete
manifestations:
a. Cyber-espionage
involving, inter alia,
the silent gathering of classified information without
the permission of
the holder of the
information.
b. Cyber-crime involv

_�����������������������������������������������������������������������������_


ing, inter alia, malware, viruses, identity theft, intentional and unauthorised access, modification to and/
or interception of computer data or programmes,
computer-related extortion, fraud and forgery.
c. Cyber-warfare involving, inter alia, offensive information operations.
d. Cyber-terror involving _inter alia Internet-based at-_
tacks in terror activities by individuals and groups.

76. Malicious cyber activity has caused damage to large-scale
real-world infrastructure. Cyber insecurity continues to pose a
prominent threat to the critical information infrastructure of the
state and pertinently to the country’s economic security. Cyberattacks have led to the theft of state funds at both the national
and provincial levels by criminal syndicates.

77. An increased reliance on information and communication
technology networks has in effect exposed the state’s cyberspace to ever-increasing vulnerability, in particular the integrity
of key national infrastructure, including financial and commercial
institutions.


78. Advancements in information and media technologies
have enabled the proliferation of national and global social networks which are increasingly being used to mobilise support
for common causes both nationally and internationally. These
technologies have also enabled radical militant groups to recruit
people, as well as plan and fund acts of terror in various countries. As national economies are increasingly information-based,
the use of information warfare is becoming a serious threat facing
governments.

79. The threat is particularly malicious as the perpetrators misuse freely available tools and commercial infrastructure, remain
largely anonymous and are exposed to very little personal risk
due to limited cyber-related legislation and jurisdictional differences when legislation is in place. In addition, the technical infrastructure of the Internet allows the targeting of multiple victims
in multiple locations, irrespective of time zones, with little additional effort and resources. Cyber-crime thus remains difficult to
prove and is consequently difficult to prosecute.

##### THE COMPLEXITY OF FUTURE CONFLICT


80. In the present global security environment the traditional boundaries between fighting a war and stabilisation operations have become blurred. It is probable that defence forces
will have to execute a mixture of conventional and unconventional operations while adopting symmetric and asymmetric approaches – indicating that the future security environment will
be characterised by complex war fighting.

81. Military operations will span the spectrum from participation in disaster relief and support to government departments,
to combat operations such as counter-terrorism and counterinsurgency operations, to lethal combat in responses to threats
to national interests or threats to democracy. Certain types of
operations can rapidly escalate from traditional peacetime interventions to major combat operations.
a. Some military operations will be conducted largely
in support of other state departments or agencies,
where those departments or agencies have the
overall executive responsibility for the operation.
Such operations will generally not entail the use of
military force.
b. Military operations in defence against a military
threat will largely be a Defence Force responsibility, although cooperation with and the involve
ment of other
departments
and agencies
will always be
required.

82. The spectrum of military operations will therefore include non-combat
operations where the use
of force will be absent or
restricted to self-defence,
to those where there is an
implicit or explicit threat
of military force, to major
combat operations that
cannot be conducted without the use of lethal force
(Figure 2-18).


tions can rapidly escalate from benign interventions to major
combat operations. Many military operations may have to be
conducted and sustained over long distances and for protracted
periods of time.

84. Defence forces will further be required to operate in
complex, highly fluid and often lethal environments, with physical and human complexity being an important characteristic. Future conflicts will thus be characterised by uncertainty, complexity and an increase in asymmetry.
a. The physical terrain may include urban areas, dense
bush, forests, mountains and areas dominated by
river systems, swamps and deserts. Difficult terrain
will become the contested battle space, with adversaries seeking to hold or exploit ground for political,
social and military purposes.
b. Ethnic, cultural, tribal, linguistic and religious diversity, and operations in the face of such tensions and
conflicts, will produce considerable human complexity. The Defence Force will therefore be required to have knowledge of culture, customs and
language as well as being master of sophisticated
weapons and systems.
c. It will be increasingly difficult to discriminate between
combatants and non-combatants and to distinguish
between groups of adversaries, either by their appearance or through the equipment and tactics that
they use.


83. Future military operations will always carry the
uncertain risk of escalation,
scale, intensity, duration,
complexity and asymmetry. Some types of opera

_Figure 2-18: The Spectrum of Military Operations_


-----

d. Counter-insurgency type operations against irregular
forces operating in and from populated areas may
result in operations being conducted amongst civilian
populations in some instances.
e. Many inter- and intra-state conflicts will demonstrate
features usually associated with criminality, acts of
terror and armed conflict fuelled by nominal or actual grievances.

85. The source of such threats may be continental or external to the continent. The projection of threat from beyond
Africa would, however, be an extreme event, requiring major
power involvement, or the collaboration of major powers, with
considerable inter-continental military and logistic sustainment
capabilities.

86. Future military operations will thus span a complex spectrum in terms of the potential or actual use of force, the nature
and capability of opposing forces, scale, intensity, duration, and
environmental variables such as location, demographics, climate
and terrain. Cooperation with other government departments
and agencies, and requirements for international cooperation
will futher influence the complexity of operations.

87. In addition to the inter-departmental, inter-agency nature
of operations, operations can also be conducted in a multi
national context, especially
where security issues transcend national borders. Figure 2-18 again illustrates this
relationship.

88. It is important that in
the planning of any of the
peace-building processes,
cognisance should be taken
of the fact that women, men
and children are affected
differently by conflict. The
integration of gender perspectives in all aspects thus
constitutes an important
strategy to support inclusive
and sustainable peace in
post-conflict environments.


##### INTERNATIONAL DEFENCE EXPENDITURE


###### INTRODUCTION

89. Defence expenditure data is important for four reasons:[18]
a. Firstly, it promotes democratic discussion of the role
and tasks of the military.
b. Secondly, it facilitates discussion of resource allocation within a national budget between the military
and the civil sectors.
c. Thirdly, its disclosure should form part of early-warning systems and confidence-building measures to
prevent military tension, arms races and armed conflict. Increased defence-spending can be a prominent
indicator of a military build-up prior to armed conflict, as war requires the diversion of resources for
the purchase of arms, munitions and other logistics.
d. Fourthly, it can be used as a tool to discuss common
security needs between states, as well as burdensharing within alliances and coalitions.

90. Below is a broad overview of the main defence expenditure and arms transfer trends at the international, continental and
regional levels.

###### GLOBAL DEFENCE EXPENDITURE

91. Towards the end of the
Cold War, international defence
expenditure declined and remained stable up until 1998
(Figure 2-19). By 1999, international defence expenditure
started to increase significantly
and rose even more rapidly
with the commencement of the
War on Terror in September
2001. By 2009, international
defence expenditure reached
defence spending levels associated with the Cold War-era.

92. The sub-regions with the
largest growth in defence expenditure since 2000 were:

_Figure 2-20 Comparative Defence Spending on Selected Countries (2009)_

a. North Africa
(107%).
b. Eastern Europe (88%). d. East Asia (71%).
c. North America (75%). e. South Asia (57%).

93. Algeria is the biggest military spender in North Africa
and on the African continent.
The strong growth in Eastern
Europe is accounted for by
the Russian Federation, whose
armed forces are going through
a significant modernisation programme up to 2020.


_Figure 2-21: Military Expenditure in Africa 1988 - 2009[20]_

20 SIPRI Handbook 2010.


94. The strong defence expenditure trend in North America is attributed to the United
States, whose defence budget
increased from 3.1% to 4.9%
of GDP and by approximately
75% in real terms, remaining
the highest international spender on defence. The United
States spent 43% of the world’s
defence spending in 2009, followed by China (6,6%), France
(4,2%), the United Kingdom


-----

(3,8%) and Russia (3,5%). In
contrast, during the Cold War
(1986), the US spent only 28%
of the world total on defence[21].

95. Western and Central Europe were the two sub-regions
that had the lowest growth in
defence spending over the same
period. The decrease in Western European defence spending
is an indication of how many
countries in this region reverted
to an emphasis on “soft power”
rather than military power.

96. Figure 2-20 is a comparative graph of selected countries
that demonstrates their 2009
defence expenditure is constant
US$ across the three planes of
actual budget, percentage of
GDP and percentage of government expenditure.

###### AFRICAN DEFENCE EXPENDITURE

97. In the new millennium,
Africa enjoyed unprecedented
economic growth of between
5% and 6% p.a. in terms of
real GDP until 2008[22]. The
continent was, however, hard
hit by the global financial crisis
as commodity prices decreased
and economic growth declined
to 3.1% in 2009 but is expected
to steadily recover into the next
decade. Africa’s defence expenditure mirrored economic
growth, increasing by 51% over
the period 1988 to 2009 (see
Figure 2-21), largely driven by
Algeria’s 97% increase in defence spending[23]. In the rest of
Africa, defence spending is relatively low by international standards.

###### SUB-SAHARAN DEFENCE EXPENDITURE

98. Although Africa’s defence spending increased in real terms,
sub-Saharan Africa’s defence spending declined from an average
of 1,75% of GDP in 2004 to 1,24% in 2008 (Figure 2-22).

99. Figures 2-23 and 2-24 below demonstrate East and


Southern Africa’s defence expenditure from 1990 to 2010 indicating that South Africa and Angola spend most on defence in
Southern Africa, while Kenya and Ethiopia spend most in East
Africa. Nigeria spends the most on defence in West Africa. It
needs to, however, be kept in mind that a large volume of armament and prime mission equipment transfers are conducted in
secret or even bartered.

###### NATURAL RESOURCES AND DEFENCE EXPENDITURE

100. Another trend over the last decade is a rapid increase
in defence expenditure by countries in many different regions
through revenues from natural resources and particularly oil and
gas[26]. The rapid increase in defence expenditure was enabled by
high commodity prices, new discoveries and exploitation. Algeria is the biggest military spender in North Africa and the African
continent. Countries with the highest growth in military spending
include: Chad (663%), Azerbaijan (471%), Kazakhstan (360%)
and Ecuador (241%).

###### ARMS TRANSFER TRENDS

101. Since the end of the Cold War there has been a steady decline in global arms transfers which reached a low-point in 2002.
Since 2002 there has been a steady increase in arms transfers up
until 2007, with a decrease in 2008 (Figure 2-25) which has not
reversed the overall upward trend.

102. Between 1980 and 1984, the top five biggest arms suppliers were the Soviet Union, the US, France, the United Kingdom
and Germany. This list changed very little in the following de

cades and the post-Cold War era. The top suppliers and recipients are indicated in Figure 2-26[27].
a. Between 2004 and 2008, the largest arms suppliers
were the US, Russia, Germany, France and the UK
and they accounted for 78% of all arms exports.
b. The top five recipients of conventional weapons between 2004 and 2008 were China, India, the UAE,
South Korea and Greece.

103. African states accounted for 7% of international imports of
major conventional weapons over the period 2004 to 2008[28].
Over this period, Algeria and South Africa were the largest arms
importers in Africa and accounted for 35% and 27% of imports
respectively. Sudan was the third largest recipient of conventional weapons with 8% of imports. The arms imports of Chad
(Sudan’s neighbour) increased five times over the period 2004 to
2008 than from 1999 to 2003.

104. Countries with increased revenues from natural resources
such as oil and gas are generally spending more on defence. African oil-producing countries such as Algeria, Chad, Angola and
Sudan can therefore be expected to significantly increase their
military inventories over the short, medium and long term.


27 Between 2005 and 2009, combat aircraft accounted for 27% of all arms transfers.

of national life and international relations.
These security challenges do not remain
constant; they change over time in response to new developments that impact
both on the internal structures of states,
as well as the global environment. Moreover, such security challenges do not exist
in isolation, but impact on and reinforce
one another and if unmitigated will give
rise to new challenges and threats.

106. Africa cannot continue to expect
the rest of the world to solve its problems; it has to become the architect of its
own destiny. South Africa is undeniably a
major power in Africa (with the leading
economy accounting for 24% of African
GDP) and as such, undeniably has a vested interest in contributing to the rooting
of democracy, the promotion of economic advancement and the pursuit of
peace, stability and development on the
African continent. That in turn requires a
balanced Defence Force with the requisite strength and the appropriate spread
of capabilities and depth of personnel and
material resources to handle a diverse
and evolving set of challenges, some of
which are as yet unknown.

###### DEFENDING SOUTH AFRICA’S TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY AND SOVEREIGNTY 

107. From a defence perspective, the
core tenet of national security means
freedom from attack or threat of attack,
the preservation of the state’s territorial
integrity, the maintenance of sovereignty,

_Figure 2-26: The Suppliers and Recipients of Major Conventional Weapons (2004-2008)[29]_ independence and physical survival. It

is within this context that South Africa’s
constitutional requirement for a Defence
Force capable of responding to an exter
##### DEFENCE IMPLICATIONS nal threat, is not only justifiable but also remains an imperative.


105. South Africa and its people exist within an international
system of states that co-exist through cooperation and interdependence. There is a myriad of factors that produce challenges
and threats to South Africa’s national security, emanating from
the political, socio-economic, environmental and military aspects

29 SIPRI Arms Transfers Database, http://armstrade.sipri.org.


108. The Defence Force is a unique instrument and an indispensable lever of power at the disposal of the State to pursue its
national security and foreign policy priorities and is consequently
at the core of South Africa’s national security. The deployment
of the Defence Force must thus be coordinated with the full


-----

range of instruments which Government can bring to bear both
domestically and regionally. However, the Defence Force provides the means of last resort when other instruments of state
are unable to protect or defend South Africa.

109. The defence of South Africa against any threat to its sovereignty, territory, national interest or peoples will remain the
primary defence priority. All other defence responsibilities will
be executed and managed according to priorities dictated by circumstance at the time. Defence of South Africa’s territorial integrity and sovereignty would most likely be a response to external
armed threats from either state or non-state actors. Such threats
would probably remain within the threshold of:
a. Firstly, at an inter-state level, that of defence against
an overt military threat or the conducting of a limited
war; and,
b. Secondly, at the level of non-state actors, defending against threats to the constitutional order and/or
insurgency.

###### PROTECTING VITAL NATIONAL INTERESTS

110. South Africa’s domestic security focuses on the interrelated
priorities of national sovereignty, territorial integrity, constitutional order, the security and continuance of national institutions,
the well-being, prosperity and upliftment of the South African
people, the growth of the economy, and demonstrable good
governance. These interests are pursued in a coordinated manner by all entities of the State, including the Defence Force.

111. The Defence Force would be required to maintain the capabilities to:
a. Ensure the freedom of South Africa to trade, including the free use of land, air and sea routes, good
order at sea and in the airspace, and the safety and
security of trade and transport hubs.
b. Ensure the security, domestically and externally, of
fundamental resources, such as minerals, energy and
water, including the safe and secure delivery, processing and distribution thereof.
c. Ensure the safety and security of domestic and external strategic installations.
d. Ensure the safety and security of the South African
people, both within national territory and abroad.

###### SAFEGUARDING TERRITORIAL BORDERS

112. South Africa’s borders are the physical manifestation of its
national sovereignty. These comprise the land, air and maritime
spaces that are internationally recognised to be under the physical control and political authority of the South African govern

ment. Prominent security challenges to South Africa’s borders
reflect inadequate control and monitoring to prevent amongst
others, the smuggling of small arms and light weapons, the activities of criminal syndicates trafficking in stolen goods and property,
the illegal sale of South Africa’s natural resources, infiltration by
terror groups, and cross-border migration issues such as disease
control.

113. Deficiencies in both Borderline Control and Border Post
Management (land, sea and air borders) continue to pose a
prominent risk to South Africa’s national security.

###### Safeguarding South Africa’s Land Borders

114. South Africa remains a destination of choice for some foreign migrants because of perceived opportunities and relative
stability. It has become increasingly clear that illegal migration
impacts broadly on South Africa in terms of social instability, the
importing of foreign conflicts into society, the financing of terror
activities, a range of criminal activity, the creation of no-go areas
and the hollowing out of the rule of law in parts of the country.

115. The main challenges confronting South Africa’s landward
ports of entry and borderline control continue to be the lack
of systems to ensure tighter security control, inadequate infrastructure, insufficient human and logistical resources and some
elements of corruption. South Africa’s land borderline remains
exploited due to the poor state of electric and sisal fences, as
well as inadequate monitoring and uncoordinated departmental
activities. In many instances the actual physical borderline does
not exist as there are no border fences. This is compounded by
the lack of communication equipment, reconnaissance capacity
and surveillance sensors for the security of the land border. As
a result, increased volumes of goods and persons are not managed efficiently; land ports of entry continue be used as a conduit
for smuggling commodities and people; and weak border-line
security has facilitated illegal migration and crimes such as rhino
poaching.

###### Safeguarding South Africa’s Airspace

116. South Africa’s airspace forms part of the country’s territoriality that must be secured. In the aviation environment challenges
continue in areas such as airport controls at landing facilities, transit management and in the general security processes regarding
migration management at international airports. Consequently
the exploitation of aviation cargo centres for the movement of
illegal goods remains a security challenge.

117. The greater part of South African airspace has not been
covered by radar, highlighting the security challenge with monitoring small to medium aircraft. Erratic radar coverage has con

-----

stituted uncontrolled airspace. At present there is no primary or
secondary coverage of some aviation borders. Consequently,
illegal cross-border air traffic has been used to smuggle contraband, including diamonds, via South Africa to foreign destinations. The Defence Force’s limited primary radar capacity leaves
some of the airspace vulnerable.

###### Safeguarding South Africa’s Maritime Territory

118. Like other coastal states, South Africa’s economy is dependent on trade. 50% of the country’s GDP comes from
trade and 95% thereof is maritime trade. In addition, 30% of
the world’s oil supply passes the Cape annually. Some of South
Africa’s major sources of wealth and political influence are the
resources in its economic zones, on its continental shelf or in its
coastal waters. At present South Africa’s ability to exercise seapower is limited both in intensity and scope.

119. There are direct maritime threats (including maritime piracy and terrorism, armed crimes and illegal activity at sea such as
illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing) and indirect threats
which include extreme weather and loss of marine biodiversity.
The most significant threat in the maritime domain remains the
illegal movement of people and goods. The continued and increased illegal exploitation of South Africa’s natural maritime resources will lead to increased crime and instability, which poses
a risk to stability in certain coastal regions of South Africa.

120.  It is therefore important for South Africa to be able to:
a. Exercise sovereignty within its territorial waters and
enjoy certain sovereign rights on its continental shelf
and exclusive economic zones.
b. Perform blue-water naval tasks and off-shore territorial control on the open ocean, beyond the reach
of littoral forces, shore-based aviation and landbased defence systems.
c. Secure the right of innocent passage for merchant
shipping, and the principle of the freedom of the
seas.
d. Perform international maritime obligations, such as:
maritime search and rescue; hydrography; maritime
charting; and the naval control of merchant shipping
when necessary.

###### SAFEGUARDING SOUTH AFRICA’S CYBERSPACE

121. South Africa must be vigilant with regard to cyber-security. Due to the increased proliferation of technology within
all realms, especially within the defence environment, Defence
needs to adapt with the rapidly changing electronic environment. The daily dependence on technology solutions reinforces the need for appropriate security measures to be cyber

secure, especially due to the borderless nature of cyberspace.

122. South Africa has established a National Cyber-Security Policy Framework whose purpose it is to create a secure,
dependable, reliable and trustworthy cyber environment that
facilitates the protection of critical information infrastructure
whilst strengthening shared human values and understanding of
cyber-security in support of national security imperatives and
the economy. The National Cyber-Security Policy Framework
sets out a number of tasks directly aligned to the Department
of Defence:
a. Address national security threats in cyberspace.
b. Combat cyber-warfare, cyber-crime and other cyber ills.
c. Develop, review and update existing substantive
and procedural laws to ensure alignment.
d. Build confidence and trust in the secure use of information and communication technologies.

123. The National Cyber-Security Policy Framework aims to
strengthen all processes related to preventing and addressing
cyber-crime, cyber-terrorism and cyber-warfare. It puts in
place the Justice, Crime Prevention and Security Cluster (JCPS)
Cyber-Security Response Committee to coordinate all South
African cyber-security activities. The establishment of the necessary structures as described in the National Cyber-Security
Policy Framework will contribute significantly to achieving the
objectives described in the policy. It is also important that Defence is involved in all these structures to ensure that cybersecurity is adequately addressed.

124. In addition, the Policy Framework states that Defence has
overall responsibility for the coordination, accountability and
implementation of cyber defence measures in South Africa as
an integral part of its National Defence mandate. Defence must
therefore spearhead the development of policies, strategies and
systems pursuant to this mandate.

###### PROMOTING CONTINENTAL AND     REGIONAL PEACE AND STABILITY

125. Since the advent of democracy in South Africa, the Southern African region has undergone substantial change. Progress
has been made towards resolving long-standing internal conflicts
and the institutionalisation of democratic practices. However,
post-conflict reconstruction has posed many challenges, particularly in socio-economic development, the integration of former
combatants and the consolidation of democracy. Of notable
concern is the constant level of insecurity in the African Great
Lakes. The pervasive state of instability in this region has negatively impacted on the broader security of contiguous states.

126. South Africa is in every way an integral part of the interna

-----

tional community and, particularly, of the African continent and
Southern Africa. It is clearly in South Africa’s interests to work
towards peace, security and stability in Africa. This will at times
require the deployment of elements of the Defence Force for a
wide range of missions, in addition to its core mission of defending and protecting South Africa and its interests.

127. South Africa must further, both in terms of its continental
leadership role and its own national interest, and in partnership
with other like-minded African states, play a leading role in conflict prevention, conflict resolution, post-conflict reconstruction
and security sector reform. This will manifest in contributions to
UN, AU and SADC security initiatives, as well as the conclusion
of specific bilateral partnerships with other African states in the
political, economic, social and security realms.

128. Consequently South Africa’s future military capability must
be commensurate with its international status, its strategic posture and its inescapable continental leadership responsibilities.
South Africa’s military capability must ultimately be able to support and enable this leadership role, as well as the pursuit of its
own national interest.

129. As South Africa increasingly assumes this leadership role,
it will similarly increasingly assume the obligation to provide experienced military leaders and proficient and well-led military
forces for peace missions and other military operations on the
African continent. These may range from non-combat operations to major combat operations potentially utilising extreme
and deadly force.

130. The Defence Force must make a vital and unique contribution that complements South Africa’s diplomatic efforts, enhances
South Africa’s influence within wider international developments,
and promotes regional security, specifically through the application of military capabilities to pressing African security issues.

###### PROTECTING SOUTH AFRICA’S PEOPLE

131. The constitutional terminology of “defend and protect”
does not only entail engagement in combat operations but also
includes military operations other than war, including peace missions, as may be ordered by Government and as provided in
law. This highlights the defence responsibility to support other
government departments and the people of the country against
environmental and non-military threats. There are four main security challenges to the South African people that would require
a defence response, namely social stability, organised and violent
crime, acts of terror and natural disasters.


###### Social Stability

132. Poverty and inequality remain potent drivers of social instability in South Africa. In general the underlying causes of protest
action include widening income inequality, unemployment and
poverty, encouraging conflict over access to scarce resources,
creating social undercurrents along ethnic, racial and xenophobic
lines, and increasing violent behaviour and criminal activity.

133. This has important implications for the operations of the
Defence Force in the creation of an enabling environment for
development. Some incidents will require Defence Force assistance to the Police Service and other State departments to
counter their impact. Other functions that the Defence Force
may undertake would include: bridge building in various areas,
supplying water to drought-stricken areas and assisting with water purification, administering medical assistance in the case of
pandemics such as cholera outbreaks, and assisting with search
and rescue operations both at sea and on land.

134. South Africa’s internal stability needs to be constantly reviewed and assessed. The defence mandate requires the Defence Force to be capable of dealing with such unrest in cooperation with the Police Service under particular circumstances.
As such, it has a direct implication for the long-term planning of
the Defence Force in defining operational theatres, command
structures, location of military bases, specific training and doctrine development, and all the other factors that will empower
the Defence Force to achieve its mandate.

###### Organised and Violent Crime

135. Organised and violent crime threatens the legitimacy and
integrity of the state and the functioning of its institutions. Crime
also undermines development and social cohesion. South Africa
faces the threat of the institutionalisation of crime. The longer
crime persists, the more embedded it becomes, and the more
difficult it becomes to dislodge and neutralise. This requires a
broad-based range of social development and security interventions, including specific cooperation between the Defence
Force, the Police Service and other government departments.

###### Acts of Terror

136. Acts of terror and extremism, as posed by both foreign
and domestic extremist and terror groups, continue to present a threat to the national security and stability of South Africa.
This threat is strongly influenced by developments outside the
borders of South Africa. Although it is in many cases indirect in
nature, it continues to require vigilance and the attention of the
intelligence and security agencies.


-----

137. The four main security risks that terrorism poses to South
Africa remain:
a. the possibility of terror groups exploiting South African territory to mount an attack in another state;
b. the possibility of South African soil being used as a
conduit or transit zone for the movement of terror
groups;
c.    an attack against a foreign target on South African
soil; and
d.    an attack against a South African vital interest, either
domestically or externally.

138. South Africa’s advanced communications, financial and
transport infrastructure encourages individuals linked to acts
of terror to exploit South African soil for logistical and support
purposes, including the transfer of funds, money laundering, recruitment and the distributing of propaganda.

139. South Africa’s response to the threat of terrorism ought to
address: perceptions and allegations of complacency by certain
foreign powers, countering possible existence of sleeper cells
inside South Africa due to uncontrolled migration and other factors; counter-terrorism operations by foreign intelligence services on South African soil; the radicalisation of local communities;


terror-financing; and possible imported terror-related issues
arising from émigré communities.

140. The Defence Force will be required to render specialised
counter-terror assistance to other Security Services.

###### Natural Disasters

141. The consequences of climate change pose some of the
most serious threats to humanity, including an increase in the
frequency and severity of floods, hurricanes, cyclones, wildfire,
prolonged droughts and rising desertification.

142. As weather patterns become more erratic and natural disasters more frequent, Defence would be expected to maintain
a capacity to play a significant supportive role in addressing the
consequences of such events. In the long term there is a need
for a comprehensive audit of the disaster management capacity
of the country as a whole. This audit is critical given the increase
in incidents of extreme weather, which cause damage to lives
and infrastructure. Latent human disasters are also a concern,
particularly as earth tremors in deep mines in our country exceed earth movements in certain earthquake regions.

## DEFENCE AND NATIONAL SECURITY


##### THE TRANSITION OF SOUTH    AFRICA’S SECURITY


1. Following the political transition in 1994, South Africa
faced a new set of situational imperatives. These included the
fundamental restructuring of its social, political and economic
sectors. It had to create a democratic society, develop its constitutional imperatives, remove economic inefficiencies and underdevelopment, and turn an inward-looking focus outward. South
Africa had to harness its economic resources and liquidity to
ensure the competitiveness of the economy and its reintegration into the global economy. Restructuring of the private and
public sectors was also a strategic imperative. South Africa had
to change the terms of its incorporation into the global system,
and reintegrate itself into the political economy of the continent
with the aim of positively engaging the African political and economic environment. South Africa in essence needed to rehabilitate itself in the family of nations.


2. This process of rebuilding and reshaping society was informed and animated by the liberating vision of striving to overcome the legacy of apartheid and colonialism and the building
of a non-racial, non-sexist and democratic society. On the international front, the building of just, equitable and cooperative
relations with the rest of the world was a necessary condition
for the realisation of South Africa’s national policy goals.

3. Post 1994, one of the government’s policy priorities was
the Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP). The
RDP was seen as the long-term means of promoting the wellbeing and security of citizens and, thereby, the stability of the
country. The RDP focused on addressing the basic needs of the
people, developing human resources, building the economy
and democratising the state and society, and is thus viewed as
part of the broader national security agenda. While the RDP has
been overtaken by later policy initiatives, the fundamental principles of the RDP endure and are embedded in our understanding of human security as a component of wider national security.

4. Constitutional provisions clearly prescribe a fundamental
break from the tradition of military involvement in politics that
characterised South Africa pre-1994. Furthermore, Cold War


-----

national security had a narrow military and security focus that
emphasised the physical protection of the state against external
military threats. The security concept has now shifted to a broader concept encompassing the safety and security of all citizens.

5. This broad safety and security perspective, emphasising
the wellbeing of the citizenry, extends by implication the political, economic, social and environmental security domains. The
personal security of the individual extends to matters such as
education, health, freedom of movement, protection of human
rights, freedom from gender-based violations and individual, political economic and democratic development. It further extends
to the rights of political and cultural communities.

6. This understanding of security does not replace the security of the state with the security of the people. It sees these as
mutually dependent. The state retains the obligation to facilitate,
if not create, the necessary conditions and environment for the
fulfilment of human security. Within this conceptualisation, Defence is but one of the elements of state power that promote
and ensure national security. Although Defence contributes to
human security, this should not distract the Defence Force from
its mandated functions. Policy should rather express how the execution of mandated defence functions and other specific initiatives can in certain circumstances contribute to the development
of South Africa’s people.


##### SOVEREIGNTY & NATIONAL POSTURE


###### SOVEREIGNTY

7. South Africa is one sovereign and democratic state[1] that is
a parliamentary republic. The Constitution is the supreme law of
the Republic[2]; law or conduct inconsistent with it is invalid, and
the obligations imposed by it must be fulfilled[3]. National security
has at its crux the protection and continuance of the sovereignty
of South Africa, its political and economic independence, and the
protection of its institutions, values and freedoms.

8. South Africa’s sovereignty is, inter alia, characterised as
follows:
a. The Constitution is the supreme law and authority.
b. Ultimate political authority is vested in the people of
South Africa who play an active role in shaping and
deciding policy through the expression of a general

1 Constitution 1996: Section 1.

2 Constitution, 1996: Section 2.

3 Constitution, 1996: Section 2.

4 Constitution 1996: Section 3(2)(a).

5 Constitution 1996: Section 3(2)(b).

6 Constitution 1996: Section 7(1).

7 Constitution 1996: Section 7(2).


public will and the aggregate civil interest of society.
c. The people are democratically represented by a
parliamentary representation system which in turn
elects the Head of State.
d. The Rule of Law is applicable, obeyed and enforced and the independent legal system is free from
interference.
e. South Africa possesses and exercises full authority
and jurisdiction over its territory, claimed areas and
resources, as well as the conferred rights in exclusive
zones.
f. South Africa is free from outside interference, intimidation or coercion upon its basic prerogatives and is
free to pursue relations with other states.
g. South African citizens are protected and are entitled
to the rights, privileges and benefits of citizenship[4];
and equally subject to the duties and responsibilities
of citizenship[5].
h. The democratic values of human dignity, equality and
freedom are affirmed[6] and are protected, promoted
and fulfilled by the State[7].
i. Order and peace are maintained and sanction for the
violation of laws is enforced.
j. Government manages the affairs of the State and
pursues the interests and welfare of its citizens.

###### NATIONAL POSTURE

9. South Africa is a multifaceted, multicultural and multiracial
nation. It is further a developing nation, its domestic and foreign
policies being driven by the developmental needs of its people.
The cornerstone of South Africa’s future prosperity is sustainable
economic growth and development, both domestically and in
the region.

10. South Africa is consequently a sovereign and peaceful
country with no aggressive intentions towards any other state.
It seeks to live in peace with its neighbours and actively pursues
the principles of non-intervention in the affairs of other nationstates. It seeks to promote peace and security, prevent and deter
conflict, pursue the peaceful resolution of conflict and deepen
systems of democracy and global governance. South Africa further recognises the interdependence of states and will seek to
promote cooperation over competition and collaboration over
confrontation.


-----

11. South Africa thus recognises that its own prosperity and
sustainability are inextricably entwined with those of the continent, and the converse thereof is also true. South Africa positions itself as an integral part of the African continent and sees
its own growth and development as being intrinsically linked to
Africa’s stability, unity, and prosperity.

12. Similarly, the security of South Africa and the security of
the region are inextricably entwined. A secure South Africa contributes to a secure region; and a secure region contributes to
a secure South Africa. Consequently, the concept of national
security cannot exist independently from the concept of regional security and, concomitantly, South Africa’s National Defence
Policy must be cognisant of the role that the Defence Force
must play in the promotion of regional security.

13. Africa is at the centre of South African policy. South Africa
recognises its responsibility to contribute significantly to the advancement of the continent. South Africa has significant diplomatic, economic and military capabilities that position it to make
a unique contribution to the resolution of many pressing African
issues. To this end, South Africa’s leadership in collaboration
with other significant and able partners will provide momentum
to African issues. South Africa specifically strives to:
a. Eradicate poverty, inequality and opportunity deprivation as the sources of instability.
b. Resolve conflicts through dialogue and negotiation,
rather than through the use of force.
c. Promote and consolidate freedom, the hard-won
rights that have been gained, and the strengthening
of the institutions that have been created.
d. Deepen democracy and globalise associated rights,
freedoms and democratic institutions wherever and
whenever possible.
e. Promote the belief that the future of the world is
based on the shared destiny of all peoples.

14. South Africa actively supports regional and continental
processes that respond to and resolve crises. South Africa’s
evolving international work recognises two canons, namely PanAfricanism and South-South solidarity. This importantly means
that national security is rooted in:
a. An understanding of South Africa being integrally
part of Africa, striving for African unity and integration, and African prosperity.
b. South-South solidarity as a firm opposition to colonialism and neo-colonialism in all their forms.

15. South Africa seeks to build an environment in which it can
realise its political, security and economic interests, thus seeking to champion collaboration, cooperation and the building of
partnerships in Africa.


###### NATIONAL INTEREST

 A Collective Concept

17. National interest is a collective concept that defines the
aggregate of things that ensure national sovereignty and which
guarantee the survival and development of a nation. National
interest has been described as a broad “sixth sense” that evolves
with a nation’s history, national experience and strategic context
and is most often asserted by the formal authority, the State.

18. National interests are by their very definition not static,
but are subject to periodic change and to differing interpretations by various sectors of society. States determine their national interest at strategic moments in their development when the
structural conditions that give rise to the national interest change
in a fundamental way. It is not every day that the national interest
is re-defined because the conditions that give rise to it are normally not volatile, but of longer duration. National interest, due
to its broad and shifting nature, cannot be decreed in statutes.

19. National interests are therefore essential and indispensable to the sovereignty of a state. It must be noted that national
interests may, in some instances, be counter-posed to the interests of other states, thus informing the development of foreign
policy.

20. Debate on national interest always gives rise to differences
of opinion and approaches. Overall, there will be those who
do not accept the prevailing view of the national interest. Furthermore, national interest and broad public interest should not
be confused with the immediate self-interest of individuals or
organisations.

###### South Africa’s Interests

21. South Africa’s national interests are evolving and maturing in pace with its emergent nationhood, requiring that cohesion and unity be forged around a common consensus on these
matters.

22. South Africa’s national interests will reflect its long-term
goals, values and aspirations, provide the ongoing purpose to
be served, provide strategic direction to policy makers, and provide consistency to South African policy-making. South Africa’s


16. South Africa envisages that, as a major power in Africa, it
will play a leading role in conflict prevention, peace-building, and
post-conflict reconstruction.


##### NATIONAL INTEREST AND     NATIONAL SECURITY


-----

national interests will reflect its collective endeavour, using national resources to advance the well-being and contentment of
the nation people, inclusive of ensuring the survival, safety and
well-being of its people and institutions.

23. The well-being and development of the South African
people form the cornerstone of the national interest. The Constitution holds the interests of South Africa’s people at its core
and enjoins a people-centred approach in the activities of the
State. South Africa consequently emphasises human development and human security within and beyond its borders. The
national interest is thus informed by a people-driven perspective
that prioritises protecting and promoting the human rights of its
citizens; enabling them to live free from fear and want; eradicating poverty; and building a society in which every citizen has access to adequate shelter, health care, education, security, work
and opportunities to generate an income.

24.  South Africa’s overarching national interest is to secure
and advance the wellbeing of its citizens. In the South African
context, national interests may be quantified as:

_Those cardinal interests that, if threatened or removed,_
_would compromise the sovereignty, independence, survival,_
_continuance or liberty of the Republic and therefore are_
_considered vital for the functioning of the state, the security_
_and well-being of the people and the preservation of the_
_South African way of life._

###### NATIONAL SECURITY

25. National security will be pursued through the coordinated
application of all means of state-power (political, diplomatic, information, economic, social and military) to meet national goals
and objectives and the political, economic, social, environmental
and cultural rights and aspirations of South Africa’s people.

26. Section 198 of the 1996 Constitution requires that:
a. National security must reflect the resolve of South
Africans, as individuals and as a nation, to live as
equals, to live in peace and harmony, to be free from
fear and want and to seek a better life;
b. The resolve to live in peace and harmony precludes
any South African citizen from participating in armed
conflict, nationally or internationally, except as provided for in terms of the Constitution or national
legislation;
c. National security must be pursued in compliance
with the law, including international law;
d. National security is subject to the authority of Parliament and the National Executive.


27. South Africa believes that addressing the causes and consequences of insecurity promotes an environment conducive to
human development. This people-centred approach to national
security thus places a legitimate, credible and cohesive developmental state at the centre of driving the overarching agenda of
building a better South Africa, a better and safer Africa and a better world for all peoples. South Africa thus pursues three main
objectives (Triple-Ps):
a. Promoting the well-being, development and upliftment of the people so as to free them from fear and
want.
b. Protecting the planet and managing climate change
to ensure the sustainability for future generations of
resources of energy, water and food.
c. Ensuring the prosperity of the country, the region
and the continent, through sustainable economic
growth and development.

28. South Africa, together with like-minded partners, remains
committed to continental and regional peace, stability and development. South Africa will thus give preference to acting in partnership, both within multilateral structures or through diplomatic
and political efforts, to:
a. Defuse contentious issues or situations before they
give rise to serious dispute or potential for conflict;
b. Resolve disputes and conflicts that do arise by means
of diplomacy, mediation or negotiation; and
c. Develop and entrench regional and continental collaborative systems and means, including alliances and
pacts, to reduce the potential for tension and conflict
and to increase the potential for the peaceful resolution of disputes and conflicts that do arise.

29. However, as a responsible government amongst the community of nations, South Africa reserves the right of self-defence
against aggressors and will equally protect the state and its people from threats to its sovereignty, independence and interests.
South Africa has and will continue to employ, inter alia, the following principal strategies within the auspices of the National
Security Council:
a. **Political, economic and military co-opera-**
**tion with other states. In this context, a com-**
mon security regime, regional defence cooperation
and the pursuit of confidence and security building
measures (CSBMs) in Southern Africa are particularly
important.
b. **The prevention, management and resolution**
**of conflict through nonviolent means. Conflict**
resolution, in the form of diplomacy, mediation or
arbitration, may take place on a bilateral basis or under the auspices of an international or regional body.


-----

These diplomatic efforts may include efforts of the
SADC Organ, the AU Peace and Security Council
and the UN Security Council.
c. **The Use of Force. The use of force, or the threat**
of the use of force, against external aggression is a
legitimate measure of last resort when political and
other interventions have been exhausted.


aged as a disciplined military force”; and provides the “primary
object” of the Defence Force as being to “defend and protect
the Republic, its territorial integrity and its people in accordance
with the Constitution and the principles of international law regulating the use of force”.

35. Schedule 6, Section 24 of the 1996 Constitution provides
that the following “Functions of the National Defence Force”, as
originally established in Section 227 of the 1993 Interim Constitution, “continue in force as if the previous Constitution had
not been repealed”:
a. For **service in the defence of the Republic,**
for the protection of its sovereignty and territorial
integrity;
b. For service in **compliance with the interna-**
**tional obligations of the Republic with regard to**
international bodies and other states;
c. For service in the preservation of life, health or
**property;**
d. For service in the provision or maintenance of
**essential services;**
e. For service in the upholding of law and order in
**the Republic in co-operation with the South**
**African Police Service under circumstances set**
out in a law where the said Police Service is unable
to maintain law and order on its own; and
f. For service in **support of any department of**
**state for the purpose of socio-economic upliftment.**

36. Section 201(2) of the 1996 Constitution provides that
“only the President, as head of the national executive, may authorise the employment of the Defence Force –
a. in co-operation with the Police Service;
b. in defence of the Republic: or
c. in fulfilment of an international obligation.”

37. Furthermore the Defence Act, 2002 [Sec 18(1)] provides
that “in addition to the employment of the Defence Force by
the President as contemplated in section 201(2) of the Constitution, the President or the Minister may authorise the employement of the Defence Force for service inside the Republic or in
international waters, in order to –
a. preserve life, health or property in emergency
or humanitarian relief operations;
b. ensure the provision of essential services;
c. **support any department of State, including**
support for purposes of socio-economic upliftment;
and
d. effect national border control.”


##### THE APPLICATION OF ‘SOFT’ AND ‘HARD’ STATE POWER


30. The complexity of the global security environment is arguably greater now than at any previous time in history, being
characterised by a wide variety of complex threats and greater
uncertainty. The current global security environment has been
described as a ‘persistent troubled peace’.

31. The power of the South African State is vested in the
integrated application of its political, diplomatic, informational,
economic, social and defence sectors and it may use these domains of ‘state power’ to successfully mitigate threats to its own
national interests and threats to democracy on the continent.
South Africa, as a major power on the continent, may be required to respond to circumstances of political, security or societal conflict, including the potential for such conflicts to rapidly
escalate to armed conflict.

32. This is to be achieved through the coordinated application of a suite of ‘soft’ and ‘hard’ power interventions, using all the domains of ‘state power’ indicated above, including
the deterrence value of the Defence Force, coupled to military interventions where appropriate. Furthermore, improved
cross-government, multi-agency and regional cooperation will
provide Government with increased options to manage future
insecurity and conflict.

33. History demonstrates that stability is seldom achieved
through dialogue and negotiation alone. The use of force, or
at least the credible threat thereof, must at times be applied
to secure peace and stability. Soft power interventions will be
far more effective if backed up by a credible military force that
is well able to conduct complex operations. The proliferation
of conflict may thus require a range of concurrent security responses, including concurrent military responses.


##### THE DEFENCE MANDATE


34. The Constitution of the Republic of South Africa[8] establishes the Defence Force; requires it to “be structured and man
8 Constitution, 1996, Chapter 11, Article 200(2), page 113.


-----

##### DEFENCE RESPONSIBILITY


38. South Africa’s national security focuses on the interrelated
priorities of national sovereignty, territorial integrity, constitutional order, the security and continuance of national institutions,
the well-being, prosperity and upliftment of the South African
people, the growth of the economy, and demonstrable good
governance.

###### SOVEREIGNTY AND TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY

39. The core defence responsibility is to ensure the protection
of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the South African
State: it’s national territory, islands, territorial waters, exclusive
economic zone and extended continental shelf responsibilities
(Figure 3-1).

40. The defence of South Africa against any threat to its sovereignty, territory, national interest or its peoples will remain the
primary defence priority. All other defence responsibilities will
be executed and managed according to priorities dictated by circumstance at the time.

41. South Africa will seek to firstly prevent and deter threats
and to secondly succeed against the threat should all other mea
_Figure 3-1: Sovereignty and Territorial Integrity_


sures fail. Understanding that there will be threats that cannot be
defused or countered by peaceful means, South Africa will:
a. **Regularly review and update defence policy**
**and strategy to ensure alignment, relevance**
**and utility to the strategic environment.**
b. **Maintain a defence posture that is strategi-**
**cally defensive and operationally offensive,**
**and**
c. **Maintain an adequate and appropriate De-**
**fence Force matched to the requirements of**
**a continually evolving strategic situation,**

42. The Defence Force is a unique instrument and an important lever of power at the disposal of the State and is consequently at the core of its national security. The Defence Force provides
the means of last resort when other instruments of state are
unable to protect or defend South Africa. Should peaceful means
and deterrence fail or the level of aggression preclude a peaceful
resolution, South Africa may consider the use of appropriate and
focused force.

###### VITAL INTERESTS

43. In the spirit of the peaceful resolution of conflict, South
Africa will follow an incremental approach to the protection of
its external national interests. Threats to South Africa’s interests


-----

will preferentially be dealt with at a bilateral or multilateral level.
The concept of collaborative protection[9] will be implemented
first, and if necessary, followed by the concept of deliberate protection[10]. Nonetheless, the Defence Force must have the capability for autonomous intervention in defence of vital interests.
Those interests and the level of autonomous action would be
defined by circumstances at the time.

44. These interests and their sub-objectives are pursued in
a coordinated manner by all entities of the State, including the
Defence Force. These are outlined below[11]:
a. Ensuring the state’s independence of decision**making on its core prerogatives and international**
relations.
b. Ensuring the freedom of South Africa to trade,
including the free use of land, air and sea routes,
good order at sea and in the airspace, and the safety
and security of trade and transport hubs (Figure
3-2).
c. Ensuring the security of internal and external

_Figure 3-2: The Ability to Trade_


**strategic resources and infrastructure such**
as minerals, energy and water, including the safe and
secure delivery, processing and distribution thereof
(Figure 3-3).
d. Ensuring the safety and security of the South
**African people, both within national territory and**
abroad.
e. Ensuring the **integrity and functioning of the**
**core systems of the state, including: the capac-**
ity and resilience of state institutions; the security of
state and other information; and good governance
and service delivery systems to provide a better life
for all.

###### DOMESTIC SECURITY

45. The Defence Force must have the capability to cooperate with the Police Service and civil authorities in dealing with
general threats to security, and in countering civil threats to the
constitutional order and sub-state threats such as terrorism and


9 Collaborative protection, in the external context, means the protection of national interests in collaboration with the host state where the interest may
lie.

10 Deliberate protection, in the external context, means the unilateral protection of an interest in a host state where the host state is unable or unwilling
to collaboratively protect the interest.

piracy. Greater cooperation with the Police Service and civil authorities would be required in countering a significant internal
threat, including low-level insurgency.

46. Border safeguarding will require the Defence Force to deal
with large numbers of illegal, mainly socio-economic, migrants as
well as criminals from beyond South African borders, requiring
cross-border cooperation to be pursued with defence forces of
the neighbouring SADC states. Such cooperation may extend
to assisting some neighbouring states with improving borderline
control capabilities.

47. The security of critical South African infrastructure remains
a Police Service responsibility, though this may be the subject
of further political discourse and decision at some future point.
Notwithstanding, the Defence Force has a contingent liability towards the securing of critical infrastructure.

48. The Defence Force will be increasingly employed in traditionally non-military roles owing to its readiness profile, training
and capacity for organised action, often as a first response to
natural disasters and other serious civil contingencies. This will
accordingly require specialised training tailored to this expanded
role, supported by current, validated and authoritative doctrine


and tactics, techniques and procedures, and an increased awareness of the legal implications of their actions.

###### CONTINENTAL PEACE AND STABILITY

49. South Africa recognises that its own security, prosperity
and sustainability and that of the African continent are inextricably entwined, and therefore further understands its own national
interest as being intrinsically linked to Africa’s stability, unity, and
prosperity. Security and development go hand in hand, and both
are the continent’s biggest challenges. South Africa, together
with like-minded partners, has a vested interest in contributing to
the rooting of democracy, the promotion of economic advancement and the pursuit of peace, stability and development on the
African continent.

50. The growth and success of the South African economy is
further intrinsically dependent on enduring peace, stability, economic development and deepened democracy on the continent.
Significant growth of the economy requires accelerated inbound
and outbound trade (in particular higher-value products) as well
as attracting significant volumes of foreign direct investment. Sustained value and volume of exports to traditional markets must
be achieved. Continental and other high growth emergent markets must be accessed.


-----

51. South Africa is undeniably a major power in Africa (with
the leading economy accounting for 24% of Africa’s GDP and
33% of that of Sub-Saharan Africa) and is obliged to play a continental leadership role, in conjunction with African partners,
extending to matters such as conflict prevention, conflict resolution, post-conflict reconstruction and security sector reform.
This will manifest in contributions to UN, AU and SADC security, democracy and good governance initiatives, as well as the
conclusion of specific bilateral partnerships with other African
states in the political, economic, social and security realms.

52. Since sources of insecurity transcend state borders, South
Africa will have to pursue collective action within multilateral organisations to provide adequate responses and lasting solutions
to conflict and insecurity. Government’s commitment to international peace and security and its manifestations at regional and
continental levels enjoins it to continue its involvement in collective defence and security mechanisms on the continent, including participation in conflict resolution mechanisms, standby arrangements and other defence cooperation at the bilateral level.

53. South Africa must be able to participate in multinational
peace missions on the continent, and should also be able to
contribute to multinational peace enforcement operations in the
case of significant inter-state or intra-state conflict. Such involve
_Figure 3-4: Peace and Stability on the Continent_


ment and the scale thereof would be discretionary, being determined by the specific situation and subject to other priorities.
Defence Force deployments beyond Africa will be exceptional
and of a limited scale and duration. In general, threats to security closer to South Africa will enjoy priority.

54. In addition to its traditional conventional role, the Defence
Force will be required to play a constructive role in post-conflict
reconstruction efforts in collaboration with other government
departments and other agencies through a Joint, Inter-Service/
Division, Interdepartmental, Inter-agency and Multinational
(JI[2]M) approach. Particular focus will be placed on the challenges
of post-conflict reconstruction as a firm foundation for sustainable development, especially in the areas of security-sector reform and the successful integration of belligerents into statutory
armed forces. Once again, operations in complex post-conflict
environments may be as dangerous as major combat missions.

55. Cognisance must also be taken of various international
efforts to curb piracy and enhance maritime security in SADC
and African waters. An increase in piracy and maritime insecurity would require the development of a strong SADC maritime
capability which includes the development of an effective and
efficient early-warning and rapid-response capability to counter
the vulnerability of Southern Africa’s maritime areas.


-----

56. South Africa’s approach to regional security thus focuses
on the interrelated priorities of the growth and development of
the Southern African region, continental peace and stability and
the creation of a just and equitable world order (Figure 3-4).
These interests and their sub-objectives are pursued in a coordinated manner by all power bases of the State, including Defence.
These may relate to:
a. Deepening democracy and promoting peace, stability, good governance and human security on the
continent.
b. Creating an environment conducive to sustainable economic growth and development on the
continent.
c. Supporting conflict prevention, peace-making,
peacekeeping and post-conflict reconstruction on
the continent.
d. Strengthening and capacitating institutions of security,
democracy and governance in SADC and the AU.
f. Strengthening partnerships with like-minded states
in the region and on the continent in the political,
economic, social and security sectors.

57. South Africa’s military capability must therefore be commensurate with South Africa’s international status, its strategic
posture and its inescapable continental leadership role. The
Defence Force must make a vital and unique contribution that
complements South Africa’s diplomatic efforts, enhances South
Africa’s influence within wider international developments, and
promotes regional security, specifically through the application of
military capabilities to pressing African security issues.

58. As South Africa expands its leadership role, it will concomitantly assume the obligation to provide experienced military leaders and proficient military forces for peace missions and
other military operations on the African continent. The deployment of the Defence Force must thus be coordinated with the
full range of instruments which Government can bring to bear
both domestically and regionally.

###### A LAYERED DEFENCE APPROACH

59. Thus, the following layered defence approach will inform
the future military strategy:
a.    Layer 1:
i. Firstly, to influence the international security
agenda through integrated diplomacy efforts
and the pursuit of national objectives.
ii. Secondly, through strategic engagement of the
UN and the African Peace and Security Architecture, to:
(1) Pursue defined multilateral security
objectives.


###### DETERRENCE

60. Deterrence is the cornerstone of South Africa’s national
security and defence policies. Its purpose is to dissuade a potential adversary from adopting a course of action that threatens
South Africa’s vital interests.

61. Deterrence may be described as a potential adversary’s
perception of South Africa’s national will, resolve and ability to
deny strategic objectives and to impose severe and unacceptable consequences against any threat posed. Deterrence is thus
an overarching national concept that links the military
**and other instruments of national power, and other**
external measures such as alliances and treaties, to deter and
counter specific threats to national security, and to support and
advance national interests and to mitigate conflict.

62. Deterrence is only likely to succeed if the envisaged combination of threats and incentives is credible and deliverable, and
its potential is communicated unequivocally to those in a position
to assess it. Effective deterrence also depends upon a demonstrable contingent capability and overt preparedness, such that
potential adversaries conclude, from their own evaluations, that
the benefit to be gained from pursuing a particular course of
action is not worth the risk associated with the possible or probable consequences.

63. Deterrence demands the capacity for a focused, prompt,
rapid and flexible national response to disparate threats, with the
Defence Force being a key component of South Africa’s overall
deterrent capability. The defence contribution to deterrence is
thus based upon **credible forces;** **rapid force generation**
capability; operational record; demonstrated ability in field

(2) Promote the deepening of democracy
on the African continent.
(3) Promote peace, security and development on the continent.
iii. Thirdly, the pursuit of strategic bilateral
objectives.
b.   Layer 2:
i. Firstly, to safeguard the South African State, its
people and its territory.
ii. Secondly, to collaboratively or deliberately
protect vital national interests.
iii. Thirdly, to contribute to South Africa’s developmental agenda.
c. **Layer 3: To defend and protect the territory, sover-**
eignty and people of the Republic of South Africa.


##### AN INTEGRATED SUITE OF DEFENCE EFFECTS


-----

**training; technological and doctrinal** **competence; and the**
visible morale of personnel.

###### ANTICIPATION

64. Priority must be given to the anticipation of future threats
in order to develop contingencies and responses to any increased instability in the strategic environment. This requires
appropriate strategic intelligence comprehension and a constant
monitoring of risk, so as to provide adequate early warning for
the development of appropriate capabilities required.

65. Anticipation thus culminates in a strategic intelligence
**comprehension, which in turn facilitates prediction,**
**responsiveness, contingency and capability develop-**
**ment and the preparation of appropriate and flexible**
**responses. The collective effort of South Africa’s intelligence**
services, including the intelligence capability of the Defence
Force, constitutes the national anticipation capability.

66. Defence must be able to effectively contend with a more
complex, rapidly changing world through timely collection, processing and dissemination of actionable intelligence in order to
accurately anticipate and respond appropriately. This requires
strategic awareness and the restoration of an effective defence
intelligence capability that provides integrated information acquired through liaison with allied and friendly forces, local human intelligence and the use of static and mobile sensors for
enhanced military decision-making. This must be pursued at the
strategic, operational and tactical levels.

67. South Africa’s national security cannot be viewed in isolation from regional and continental security, thus requiring that a
premium be placed on the regional and continental early warning systems.

###### PREVENTION

68. Emphasis is placed on the prevention of conflict through
peaceful means by enhancing cooperation and collaboration
on security matters. Prevention requires a national ability to
**peacefully reduce, defuse or resolve potential conflict**
**and disputes through primarily political and diplomat-**
**ic means. The spectrum of preventative efforts may extend**
from that of cooperation and collaboration between parties or
states to that of negotiation or arbitration.

69. South Africa’s prevention capability is primarily vested
in the political, legal, diplomatic and intelligence dimensions
of state authority. South Africa’s national security depends on
sound international relations and responsive security institu

tions, thus necessitating a robust contribution to the strengthening and capacitation of the African Peace and Security Architecture and playing a rightful and appropriate role in the UN
security structures.

70. South Africa’s contribution to the prevention and resolution of conflict will be enhanced through an integration of its diplomatic, military and other efforts, in a complementary manner
that strengthens South Africa’s capacity to influence international
developments. Defence diplomacy efforts will further support
South Africa’s strategic agenda, extending to:
a. maintaining strategic bilateral relationships;
b. engagement of international security issues;
c. active participation in **multilateral security**
**processes;**
d. establishing **collective security mechanisms;**
and
e. **strong representation in international defence**
and security institutions.

71. In the domestic context Defence can, in support of civil
authority, contribute to the prevention of social disruption by
increasing the resilience of the population through various programmes and initiatives.

###### PROTECTION

72. South Africa will protect and secure its sovereignty, territory, national interests and people through harnessing the
cumulative capacity of all elements of state power. Notwithstanding the vast contribution made by all other organs of state,
the Defence Force plays a pivotal role in this regard with most
defence capabilities organised towards the defence and protection of South Africa, its territory and its people. The defence
responsibility will, inter alia, extend to aspects such as:
a. **Defending the Republic against armed aggres-**
sion and threats to the constitutional order.
b. The execution of national tasks, such as **border**
**safeguarding,** **maritime security,** **cyber-se-**
**curity and airspace defence.**
c. The protection of vital maritime, air and land trade
**routes, good order at sea and in the airspace, and**
the **safety and security of trade and trans-**
**port hubs.**
d. Fulfilling South Africa’s international treaty
**obligations.**
e. The **safeguarding** of South Africa’s **key**
**infrastructure.**
f. **Assisting civil authority with the enforcement of**
the rule of law and the maintenance of public order
and security.


-----

g. **Assistance in disaster relief and in the event of**
large-scale humanitarian crisis.
h. **Contributing to the social upliftment of the**
South African people within the context of a developmental state.

73. The Defence Force must be maintained as a **robust,**
**balanced, modern and flexible force with capabilities**
**and technologies appropriate to operations in the Afri-**
**can environment. The Defence Force must be appropriately**
equipped, capacitated and resourced to execute and sustain required landward, air, maritime, Special Forces, information and
military health operations in the protection and defence of South
Africa.

74. The mandate of Defence requires the maintenance of
comprehensive defence capabilities. Many capabilities need not
be maintained at a high level, nor is the full spectrum of potentially required capabilities affordable or sustainable at full readiness.
Capabilities will therefore, wherever possible, be maintained to
ensure expansion to the required levels as and when needed.

###### INTERVENTION

75. South Africa’s intervention capability is the comprehensive
coercive capacity of the State, within the rule of law, to influence,
interrupt, intrude or force change in the outcome of events, developments or contingencies that demonstrably threaten South
African interests. An intervention may also extend to a collaborative effort with other allies or multilateral organisations. Such
intervention may thus extend to:
a. **Collaborative protection of threatened interests**
beyond South Africa’s borders with the host nation
state.
b. **Deliberate protection of threatened interests**
beyond South Africa’s borders if there is a lack of
capacity or will to intervene by the host nation state.
c. Conducting operations to **protect South African**

territory abroad and either protect or evacuate South African
diplomats and citizens in areas of
conflict.
d. An intervention in the wider interest, such as an intervention in
the case of grave circumstances or
human rights violations, to establish or re-establish the international
rule of law, or to separate belligerents in a conflict.


operations, through a balanced suite of capabilities that adhere
to the strategic concepts of **rapid reaction,** **expedition-**
**ary ability to project forces for protracted periods, complex**
**war fighting in the human and physical dimensions of the battle**
space, **interoperability of command and control systems,**
**concurrency of operations in multiple theatres and** **joint,**
**inter-agency, inter-departmental and multinational**
**cooperation.**

###### STABILISATION AND NORMALISATION

77. Stabilisation and normalisation relate to the immediate and
extended intent to improve circumstances, restore equilibrium
and create the conditions for the sustainment of stabil**ity, security and the rule of law in a former area of con-**
**flict or instability. This is a collective effort, in which govern-**
ment departments, business, labour, multilateral organisations
and the spectrum of non-governmental organisations have a role
to play in assisting efforts to promote stable political, economic
and social development and the rule of law.

78. Defence Forces are repeatedly called on to contribute to
post-conflict reconstruction and emergency relief in the event of
a man-made or natural disaster. Although the responsibility for
these activities primarily lies in the civilian domain, the circumstances sometimes require the use of defence assets. Such stabilisation operations often require years and sometimes decades
of military involvement.

79. The defence contribution to the stabilisation effect will
be diverse in nature, but would focus primarily on the recon**struction of the security sector through the demobilisation**
of belligerent parties and the establishment and training of the
respective legitimate, statutory defence forces. Defence expertise is often required to advise and train security agencies in
post-conflict areas. The Defence Force can make the following
contributions:
a. International peace support operations.


76. The Defence Force must be appropriately equipped, resourced and multi-role trained
to execute a wide spectrum of intervention


_Figure 3-5: The Defence Mission_


-----

_Figure 3-6: Defence Goals and Tasks_

b. International humanitarian assistance and intervention in support of civil authority.
c. **Reconstruction in a former conflict area.**
d. **Demobilisation, disarmament and reintegra-**
**tion of former belligerents.**
e. Demobilisation and repatriation of **child soldiers**
and those not wishing to take up arms in a statutory
force.
f. **Advising, training and** **educating security per-**
sonnel and organisations.


##### DEFENCE MISSION, GOALS AND TASKS


80. The defence policy takes its lead from South Africa’s
national security, national posture and national interests. The
adoption of an effects-based strategy approach allows for a
threat-independent determination of capabilities required,
based on government’s intended level of defence capability.
This approach elucidates a clear and unambiguous understanding of South Africa’s defence mission (Figure 3-5), and identifies
four strategic defence goals and thirteen strategic defence tasks
(Figure 3-6).

81. The strategic defence tasks provide a future-focused
framework for detailed defence planning on the size, shape and
capabilities of the Defence Force and the development of its


force design, force structure, establishment
table and capability strategy.

###### PRIORITISATION OF DEFENCE GOALS AND TASKS

82. The Defence mandate, as derived
from the Constitution, provides a legal statement of purpose, covering the full spectrum
of possible defence employment. The functions listed in the Constitution stipulate the
purposes for which the Defence Force may
be employed. Furthermore employment
of the Defence Force will be considered
against environmental circumstances, national security policy, government priorities
and the availability of resources.

83. It is extremely important to note that
the above goals and tasks are not prioritised,
but present the full spectrum of defence activity necessary to attain the intent of the
Constitution (1996) and the stated Defence

Mission. The prioritisation of goals and tasks, informed by the
primary object of the Defence Force, is the prerogative of the
President and the Cabinet according to an ongoing assessment
of South Africa’s strategic environment. This assessment must
inform the strategic reserves as a measure of national effort.

###### DEVELOPING A BALANCED SUITE OF    DEFENCE CAPABILITIES

84. South Africa requires a significant and credible defence
capability to confront diverse challenges. Undoubtedly, the Defence Force will have to operate in complex, highly fluid and often lethal environments that are characterised by a wide variety
of threats and lethality. The challenge will be to strike an effective and sustainable balance of defence capabilities that enable
the conducting of successful operations across the spectrum of
conflict.

85. Defence capabilities must support and enable South Africa’s continental and regional leadership responsibilities and the
protection and furtherance of its national interest.

86. The complex, highly fluid and highly unpredictable security
environment requires the careful development of South Africa’s
future defence capabilities, in turn requiring the Defence Force
to constantly adapt doctrine, tactics and training to suit the tactical demands of the operational situation. The Defence Force


-----

will increasingly require highly integrated levels of command and
control, protection, mobility, firepower, sustainment and situational awareness.

87. Heightened levels of domain awareness and appropriate
decision-making and leadership will therefore be the critical factor in determining the appropriate preparation for and responses
to emerging security trends. A strong and effective information
acquisition and analysis capability together with an effective defence long-term planning capability is critical to building a significant and credible defence capability able to confront all challenges presented.

88. Dealing with such diverse and adaptive threats will de

mand more investment in the selection, education, training and
development of high-calibre leaders who will be able to contend
with future complexity.

89. It is imperative that short-term contingencies do not dictate the long-term and ultimate force design of the Defence
Force. As such, the likelihood of an external conventional threat
to South Africa must be constantly reviewed and assessed in
relation to the more immediate threats to our country and its
citizenry, which are of a non-conventional and human security
nature[12]. The challenge for the Defence Force will be to decide
upon a Force Design and Structure that is sufficiently balanced to
provide a long-term credible and sustainable capability.


12 Human Security refers to the broadened conceptualisation of security that encompasses political, social, economic and environmental dimensions of
threats and sources of insecurity.

capacity as Head of the National Executive and
Commander-in-Chief of the Defence Force[9].
b. **Is the Commander[10] of the Defence Force and**
has full command of subordinate units and any assigned auxiliary service, and as such:


-----

supported by science, engineering and technology
capabilities.
b. The Defence Force is **structured in combat**

morale, sense of duty and pride in themselves, their
capabilities and their equipment.
g. Soldiers are led by exemplary, competent, ethical
and dynamic leaders. Mission command is the foundation of the defence leadership philosophy.
h. **Commanders have the required delegations to**
**discharge their duties and responsibilities.**
Commanders are accountable and responsible for
the execution of their assigned mandates and the resources allocated.
i. Due consideration and cognisance are given to the
**unique nature of the Defence Force relative to**
the wider public service.

5. Consequently, the Defence Force will be **structured**
**and organised according to command and staff lines to**
facilitate functional liaison and promote effective command and
control.

6. The Chief of the Defence Force retains command
**over the Defence Force and confers operational control**
**over assigned forces to operational level headquarters**
for the conduct of authorised operations. The Chief of the Defence Force may establish such temporary task force, group,
element or unit as may be required for military exercises or operations, and may, for that purpose, establish such number of
temporary headquarters as may be required[17].

7. The Defence Force, across capabilities and at all levels, will
be structured in recognised combat formations adhering
to the axiom: ‘We train as we fight’. Consequently, the Chief of
the Defence Force will have the following under command:
a. A permanent operational-level command and control capability.
b.  A landward defence capability.
c. An air defence capability.
d. A maritime defence capability.
e.  A military health capability.
f. A Special Forces capability.
g.  A logistics execution capability.
h.  A training and doctrine execution capability.
i.   An information and communication systems execution capability.

8. The **General Staff, assisting the Chief of the Defence**
Force with functional control over specific resource ar

-----

**eas, will provide the staff capacity by which the Chief of the De-**
fence Force can set strategic direction for that resource area
through the establishment of outcomes, outputs and targets and
which enable the planning and the allocation of resources. To
this end, the respective General Staff Components will direct,
**orchestrate and control the management of their** **specific**
**resource areas throughout the Defence Force, coordinating**
through the functional lines of control (staff lines).

9. Consequently, the Defence Headquarters will comprise
the Chief of the Defence Force, a Chief of Staff (CoS) and the
following staff functionalities in a manner to be later organised
and structured:
a. Personnel.
b. Intelligence.
c. Operations.
d. Logistics.
e. Planning.
f. Information and Communication Systems (ICS).
g. Training.
h. Finance.
i. Specialist Staffs.

10. The fundamental tenet of military command and
**control is ‘mission command’ which implies:**
a. Commanders, at whichever level, have the absolute
responsibility to obediently act or, in certain circumstances, to decide not to act, within the framework
of a superior commander’s intent.
b. Decentralised command, freedom and speed of action and initiative, are promoted, yet tempered and
necessarily responsive to superior direction.
c. That subordinates understand the intent of a higher
commander and their own contribution to the plan.
d. Carrying out missions with the maximum freedom
of action and appropriate resources.
e. Delegation of authority and agility in the execution
of a mission with an appropriate balance between
direction and delegation.


##### CIVIL CONTROL AND CIVIL OVERSIGHT


11. National Security. It is required that national security
must be pursued in compliance with the law[18], including international law. National security is further subject to the authority
of Parliament and the national executive[19]. Consequently the
defence sector is subject to civil control by the National Execu
18 Constitution, 1996, Section 198(c).

19 Constitution, 1996, Section 198(d).

20 White Paper on Defence, 1996.


tive and civil oversight by Parliament. The hierarchy of authority
between the Executive, Parliament and the Defence Force[20] is
prescribed in the Constitution, 1996[21]. Civil control and oversight in South Africa are enforced by the following principles:
a. The supremacy of the Constitution and the rule of
law.
b. Adherence to domestic and international law, including International Humanitarian Law.

12. Civil Control. The defence sector is subject to civil control by the President and the National Executive, as represented
by the Minister of Defence in that:
a. The President is the head of State, head of Executive
and Commander-in-Chief.
b. The President as head of the National Executive appoints the Military Command.
c. Only the President may authorise the employment
of the Defence Force in certain instances.
d. A member of Cabinet must be responsible for
Defence.
e. The command of the Defence Force must be exercised in accordance with the directions of the cabinet member responsible for Defence, under the
authority of the President.
f. The Minister may authorise the employment of the
Defence Force in instances other than reserved for
the President in the Constitution.
g. A civilian Secretariat for Defence is established to
function under the direction of the Cabinet member
responsible for Defence.

13. Civil Oversight. Civil oversight refers to the civil oversight role of Parliament. Parliament consists of the National Assembly and the National Council of Provinces, who participate
in the legislative process in the manner set out in the
Constitution.
a. The National Assembly is elected to represent the
people and to ensure government by the people
under the Constitution. It does this by choosing the
President, by providing a national forum for public
consideration of issues and by scrutinising and overseeing executive action.
b. The National Council of Provinces represents
the provinces to ensure that provincial interests
are taken into account in the national sphere of
government.
c. The legislative authority of the national sphere of
government is vested in Parliament, as set out in


21 Refer to Sections 198(d), 199(8), 200(2), 201(2) and (3), 202(1) and (2), 203(1) and (3) and 204 of the Constitution, 1996.


-----

section 44 of the Constitution, including to pass legislation with regard to any matter in a functional area.
d. The National Assembly must provide for mechanisms to hold national organs of state accountable to
it and to maintain oversight over National Executive
authority and the implementation of legislation.
e. Parliamentary committees, established from the
body of elected public representatives, play an important oversight role with regard to the security
services. This is reflected in Parliament’s responsibility to approve:
i. The finances for the security forces.
ii. The legislation governing activities of the security forces.
iii. The policy framework within which the security forces will function.

14. It is thus important that the Defence Force and its

members:
a. Are fully conversant with the
features of the democratic
system.
b. Adhere to elected authority.
c. Avoid politics and apply functional military expertise.
d. Understand the integrated
contribution Defence makes
in terms of government’s key
policy initiatives.
e. Are able, on a discursive basis,
to interact with the elected
civil authority around a range
of issues critical to the Defence
mandate.


16. The framework hierarchy of defence direction found hereunder is a tool for organising and considering strategic defence
decisions, for the planning and execution of military operations,
and for organising and considering political/military activity. The
four levels of decision-making (Figure 4-1) refer to:
a. The National Strategic Level, which equates to
National Security Policy, Cluster Strategies and the
Defence Policy.
b. The **Military Strategic Level, which equates to**
the Military Strategy and the Theatre of Operations
Strategy.
c. The **Operational Level, at which the military**
strategy is implemented through Campaign Plans,
including assigning missions, forces and resources to
operations.

##### DEFENCE COMMAND AND CONTROL


###### LEVELS OF DECISION-MAKING

15. Defence forces around the world
have identified the need to understand the
task of providing defence direction at various identifiable levels of responsibility and
detail. The identification of a hierarchy of
defence direction, command and control
does not necessarily intend dogmatic and
rigid obedience thereto, but rather provides a practical construct to assist with
complex decision-making and judgement
by all concerned within a continually evolving and fluctuating environment.


_Figure 4-1: Levels of Decision-Making_


-----

###### THE NATIONAL STRATEGIC LEVEL

17. The national strategic level coordinates the application of
the full spectrum of the capacity of the State to achieve policy
objectives and pursue national interests. The national strategic
level is the domain of the President and the National Executive.
The Defence Force is one component of national power available to Government in the pursuit of strategic interests.

18. The President of the Republic of South Africa.
a. The executive authority of the State is vested in the
President of the Republic of South Africa[22] (hereafter referred to as the President). Such executive authority is exercised[23], together with other members
of Cabinet, by:
i. implementing national legislation;
ii. developing and implementing national policy;
iii. coordinating the functions of State departments and administrations;
iv. preparing and initiating national legislation; and
v. performing any other executive function provided for in the Constitution or any other national legislation.
b. The President is ascribed specific authority as the
Head of State, Head of the National Executive[24] and
Commander-in-Chief[25].
c. It is in terms of the President’s authority as Head of
the National Executive that:
i. The President exercises executive authority as
Commander-in-Chief of the Defence Force.
ii. The President must appoint the Military Command of the Defence Force[26].

19. **The Minister. The Constitution requires that a member**
of Cabinet must be responsible for defence[27]. The following
principles consequently apply:
a. Command of the Defence Force must be exercised
in accordance with the directions of the Cabinet
member responsible for defence, under the authority of the President[28].

22 Constitution, 1996, Section 85(1).

23 Constitution, 1996, Section 85(2).

24 Constitution, 1996, Section 84(a).

25 Constitution, 1996, Section 202(1).

26 Constitution, 1996, Section 202(1).

27 Constitution, 1996, Section 201(1).

28 Constitution, 1996, Section 202(2).

29 Constitution, 1996, Section 92(1).

30 Constitution, 1996, Section 92(3)(a).

31 Constitution, 1996, Section 92(2).

32 Constitution, 1996, Section 92(3)(b).


b. The Minister of Defence (hereafter referred to as
the Minister) is responsible for the powers and functions assigned by the President[29].
c. The Minister must act in accordance with the
Constitution[30].
d. The Minister exercises civil control and provides political guidelines on defence matters.
e. The Minister sets the defence policy framework
and strategic priorities, is responsible for the effective implementation of Government’s policy directions, the execution of approved programmes and
acquires the resources required for the defence of
the Republic of South Africa.
f. The President and the Minister formally confer on
matters of defence and the Minister advises Cabinet
on defence- and security-related matters.
g. The Minister is accountable to Parliament for the exercise of his/her powers and the performance of his/
her functions[31] and must provide Parliament with full
and regular reports concerning matters under his/
her control[32].

20. It is important to note that Section 24(1) of Schedule 6
of the 1996 Constitution continues-in-force Section 225 of the
1993 Interim Constitution “as if the previous Constitution had
_not been repealed” and which states that the executive military_
command shall be exercised by the Chief of the Defence Force
“subject to the directions of the Minister responsible for defence
_and, during a state of national defence, of the President”._

21. **The National Policy on Defence. The President,**
as Head of State, Head of the Executive and Commander-inChief, works collaboratively with Cabinet Ministers to initiate
and decide on policy and coordinate the efforts of the State. In
so doing:
a. Cabinet determines national policy objectives and
the concomitant national strategy to be pursued.
b. Cabinet provides resources for policy objectives and
strategy according to the priorities of Government.
Funds are appropriated by Parliament by means of a
vote.


-----

c. The Cabinet determines the National Policy on
Defence.
d. There is thus a dynamic relationship between the
national policy objectives and the defence policy.
e. Military considerations will, in turn, also shape policy.
This is especially true when the conflict is largely military in nature.

22. **Management of Security at the Strategic Level. At**
the highest level, the management of security and the resolution
of conflict reside with the President and Cabinet, either individually or in committee.
a. At the strategic level Cabinet controls all the means
and power bases of the state (political, diplomatic,
information, economic and military) to resolve insecurity and conflict. In accordance with national posture, the use of military force is the means of last
resort.
b. Each and every incident of insecurity and conflict will
be different, thus there is no single template for the
resolution of such. The President and Cabinet will
exercise judgement on the most effective approach
to tackling a particular situation. This may well be
through a National Security Council, a Committee
of Cabinet or any other committee specifically set
up for this purpose. The leadership may well vary
depending on the nature of the crisis.
c. Cabinet may consider developing, deploying, sustaining, recovering and re-deploying the Defence
Force for the attainment of national objectives. Cabinet is assisted in this work by intelligence estimates,
intelligence briefs and strategic awareness.
i. Cabinet further determines the quantity, quality and level of strategic national resources required (eg oil, ammunition, strategic lift).
ii. Strategic sustainment is planned and coordinated interdepartmentally with role-playing
departments responsible for various national
strategic resources and industry. This sustainment may further be coordinated with international partners.
ii. Cabinet will, if necessary, provide the means
to augment the capacity of the Defence Force
in accordance with changes to the strategic
environment.

23. **National Council on Defence. The establishment of**
a National Council on Defence is proposed and which may be
provided in law whereby:
a. The mandate and functions of the National Council
on Defence will relate to:

33 Defence Act, 2002 (Act 42 of 2002), Section 4.

34 Defence Act, 2002 (Act 42 of 2002), Section 8(d).


i. Matters of National Defence.
ii. Defence policy.
iii. Placing the Defence Force in service.
iv. Strategic matters related to the defence
function.
b. The President, the Minister, the Secretary for Defence and the Military Command will comprise the
National Council on Defence.
c. The President may appoint or co-opt any other person as it may be deemed necessary.
d. The National Council on Defence will meet at least
every quarter.
e. The Military Command will present quarterly reports and an annual report on the readiness of the
Defence Force.

###### THE MILITARY STRATEGIC LEVEL

24. Defence Headquarters is both a departmental headquarters and a military headquarters, and is instrumental as the interface between the strategic level and the operational level. Colocated with the Ministry of Defence, the interaction between
the Minister of Defence, the Secretary for Defence, the Chief of
the Defence Force and Chiefs of Services and Staff Divisions is
facilitated to support the formulation of defence policy and the
attainment of the military strategy and objectives.

25. The military strategic level of decision-making is orientated
to the interface between the defence policy, the military strategy
and the theatre of operations strategy.

26. **Secretary for Defence. The Secretary for Defence is**
the primary tool and resource for the Minister to enable him/
her to exercise civil control. As the formal policy advisor to the
Minister, the Secretary for Defence:
a. Enhances the Minister’s ability to exercise civil control over the defence function.
b. Performs such functions as may be entrusted by the
Minister, in particular those necessary or expedient
to enhance civil control and civil oversight by:
i. The Minister over Defence.
ii. Parliament over Defence.
iii. Parliamentary committees having oversight
over Defence.
c. Exercises powers vested through the Constitution
and other statutes, subject to and in accordance with
any direction of the Minister without fear, favour or
prejudice.
d. Assists and supports the Minister in contributing to
the formulation of the government’s security policy
and further assists and supports the Minister in devel

-----

oping and adapting the defence policy that best pursues national policy objectives and national interests.
e. As one of the key mechanisms of civil control, is responsible to the Minister in coordinating and compiling all relevant instruments through which either
the President or the Minister may authorise the employment of the Defence Force and further direct
such service as required by the Constitution (1996)
or any other statute. This would extend to:
i. The coordination and compilation of the Presidential Minute and Explanatory Memorandum, any necessary Cabinet Memorandum
and any Ministerial Directive directing the Defence Force to conduct such service, and any
consequent instruction or direction thereto.
ii. Identifying the legal implications, both domestic and international, of any employment.
iii. Identifying the financial implications of any
employment.
iv. Maintaining a system to monitor and evaluate
any employment.
v. Maintaining a system to administrate, record
and maintain the currency of any employment.
f. Is responsible to the Minister in determining ministerial priorities and strategic guidelines on defence matters. This extends to setting the following strategic direction for the Minister’s subsequent
authorisation:
i. Ministerial strategic priorities, ministerial strategic guidelines, ministerial directives and ministerial planning instructions.
ii. Ministerial policy options for the MTSF/MTEF
processes.
iii. Ministerial policy research and direction.
iv. Ministerial defence diplomacy framework, direction and engagement.
v. Setting defence resource priorities.
vi. Requirements in terms of defence governance, accountability, control and risk frameworks required for the accountable management of defence resources.
g. Is responsible to the Minister in determining strategic direction, accountabilility mechanisms and
oversight over all defence public entities, including
the Defence Acquisition Agent and the acquisition/
procurement of defence matériel.
h. Advises the Minister on any matter referred by the
Minister[35].
i. Provides the Minister with parliamentary and cabinet administrative and coordination services, including the coordination of:

35 Defence Act, 2002 (Act No 42 of 2002), Section 8(b) & (c).


i. The cabinet and parliamentary programme on
defence.
ii. Parliamentary questions.
iii. The defence legislative programme.
j. Provides the Minister with legal services (excluding
the Military Justice System) which will entail, inter
alia, legislation, litigation and legal advice.
k. Engages with defence stakeholders and manages
intra-governmental liaison at the national-strategic
and military-strategic levels.
27. **Chief of the Defence Force. The Chief of the Defence**
Force:
a. Is the Commander of the Defence Force and is the
military strategic authority.
b. Formulates the military strategy and doctrine in coherence with Government policies and strategic
objectives.
c. Provides the military strategic context and direction for operations, including priorities, parameters,
command and control and any limitations, inter alia,
political, legal and financial).
d. Designates the theatre of operations and assigns
forces and directs resources and reserves to a number of differing and (potentially) concurrent military
operations.

28. **Operations Staff.** The Chief of the Defence Force’s
operations staff provides the Chief of the Defence Force with
staff assistance in the provision of military strategic direction to
the Operations Headquarters for the conduct of operations.

29. **Service and Division Chiefs. Service and Division**
Chiefs generate combat-ready capabilities for assignment by the
Chief of the Defence Force.

###### THE OPERATIONAL LEVEL

30. The key difference between the military strategic and operational levels is that the military strategic level is concerned
with allocating objectives and resources and setting necessary
limitations, while the operational level plans and orders the activities of assigned forces.

31. The operational level is thus concerned with the planning
and conducting of operations. It is at this level that the military
strategy and theatre of operations strategies are implemented
by assigning missions, forces and resources to operations.

32. The permanent joint operations headquarters, at the operational level, is responsible for the planning and execution of
joint and combined military operations and joint and combined


-----

exercises. Thus the permanent Joint Operations Headquarters
exercises operational control over assigned forces as directed by
the Chief of the Defence Force.

###### THE TACTICAL LEVEL

33. At the tactical level, military activities and engagements are
planned and executed in order to achieve operational-level military objectives. Tactical-level command will be provided by land,
air or maritime joint tactical headquarters provided by Services,
and placed under command of the permanent Joint Operations
Headquarters.


##### EMPLOYMENT OF THE DEFENCE FORCE FOR SERVICE


34. **Mandate.**
a. Only the President may authorise[36] the employment
of the Defence Force in cooperation with the Police
Service, in defence of the Republic, or in fulfilment of
an international obligation[37].
b. The President, or the Minister, may authorise the
employment of the Defence Force inside the Republic or in international waters, in order to: preserve life, health or property in emergency or humanitarian relief operations; ensure the provision of
essential services; support any department of state,
including support for purposes of socio-economic
upliftment; or effect national border control[38].
c. The process and instruments for Presidential authorisation of operations are prescribed in the Manual on the Executive Acts of the President[39]. This is
exercised together with the Minister[40] through the
signing of a Presidential Minute[41].

35. **Parliamentary Procedure. Parliamentary procedures**
to be followed when authorising the deployment of the Defence
Force are indicated hereunder.

a. Section 201(3)[42] and 201(4)[43] of the Constitution,
1996 state that:

_(3) When the defence force is deployed for any pur-_
_pose mentioned in subsection (2), the President must_

41 Manual on the Executive Acts of the President, Chapter 3, par 3.4.

42 Constitution, 1996, Section 201(3).

43 Constitution, 1996, Section 201(4).


_inform Parliament, promptly and in appropriate detail,_
_of-_
_(a) the reasons for the employment of the defence_
_force;_
_(b) any place where the force is being employed;_
_(c) the number of people involved; and_
_(d) the period for which the force is expected to be_
_employed._
_(4) If Parliament does not sit during the first seven days_
_after the defence force is employed as envisaged in_
_subsection (2), the President must provide the infor-_
_mation required in subsection (3) to the appropriate_
_oversight committee._

b. Section 18 of the Defence Act, 2002 further states
that:

_(2) When the Defence Force is employed for any pur-_
_pose contemplated in paragraph (a), (b), (c) or (d) of_
_subsection (1), the President or Minister, as the case_
_may be, must inform Parliament promptly and in ap-_
_propriate detail of the –_
_(a) reasons for such employment;_
_(b) place where the Defence Force is being_
_employed;_
_(c) number of people involved;_
_(d) period for which the Defence Force is expected_
_to be employed; and_
_(e) expenditure incurred or expected to be incurred._
_(3) If Parliament does not sit during the first seven days_
_after the employment of the Defence Force as con-_
_templated in subsection (2), the President or Minister,_
_as the case may be, must provide the information re-_
_quired in that subsection to the appropriate oversight_
_committee of Parliament on Defence._
_(4) If the Defence Force is employed by the President_
_for any purpose contemplated in section 201(2) of the_
_Constitution, the President must also comply with sub-_
_section (2)(e)._
_(5) Parliament may by resolution within seven days_
_after receiving information contemplated in subsection_
_(2) from the President or the Minister –_
_(a) confirm any such authorisation of employment;_
_(b) order the amendment of such authorisation;_


-----

_(c) order the substitution for such authorisation of_
_any other appropriate authorisation; or_
_(d) order the termination of the employment of the_
_Defence Force._
_(6) An order contemplated in subsection (5)(b), (c) or_
_(d) does not affect –_
_(a) the validity of the authorisation up to the mo-_
_ment of the passing of the resolution by Parliament;_
_(b) the validity of anything done by virtue of the_
_authorisation up to the moment that the amend-_
_ment, substitution or termination of the authorisa-_
_tion takes effect; or_
_(c) any right, privilege, obligation or liability ac-_
_quired, accrued or incurred as a result of the_
_authorisation for the employment of the Defence_
_Force, up to the applicable moment contemplated_
_in paragraph (b)._
_(7) (a) If authorisation by the Minister in terms of sub-_
_section (1)(a) cannot be obtained in time to avert im-_
_minent danger to life, health or property, the Secretary_
_for Defence, with the concurrence of the Chief of the_
_Defence Force, may, in accordance with a standing_
_arrangement delegated by the Minister in this regard,_
_authorise the employment of the National Defence_
_Force for purposes of that subsection._
_(b) The Secretary for Defence must inform the_
_Minister as soon as possible of such authorisation_
_and provide the Minister with the information re-_
_ferred to in subsection (2)._
_(c) The Minister may cancel the authorisation if he_
_or she disagrees, in which case subsection (6) ap-_
_plies with the necessary changes._
_(d) If the Minister agrees with the authorisation,_
_subsections (2), (3), (5) and (6) apply with the_
_necessary changes._

36. **State of National Defence. The 1996 Constitution**
however provides that the President should summon Parliament when declaring a state of national defence [Section 203(2)
and (3)]:

_If Parliament is not sitting when a state of national defence_
_is declared, the President must summon Parliament to an_
_extraordinary sitting within seven days of the declaration._


_A declaration of a state of national defence lapses un-_
_less it is approved by Parliament within seven days of the_
_declaration._

37. **Principles to be considered when committing**
**forces to military action abroad. The following basic prin-**
ciples should be considered when committing the Defence
Force to military action abroad:
a. South Africa should not commit its forces to military action abroad, unless it is vital to the national
interest.
b. If forces are committed to military action abroad,
it must be done with a clear intent and with clearly
defined and realistic objectives.
c. There must be reasonable assurance that military
actions to be taken will have the support of the
South African people and their Parliament.
d. Even after all the above tests are met, forces should
only be committed to military action abroad as a last
resort, when no other choice is available.
e. Committed forces must have the necessary resources and support to succeed in the face of such
military action.

38. **Possible Amendment of Legislation and Proce-**
**dure. Recent experience has demonstrated a necessity for the**
review of legislation and procedure with regard to putting the
Defence Force into service. Therefore amendment is needed
as follows:
a. Clarify levels of authority to put the Defence Force
in service as provided in Section 18(1) of the Defence Act, 2002.
b. The authorisation of operations of a sensitive and/
or secret nature and the informing of Parliament
thereof.
c. Providing in law for the task of protecting of South
African citizens and assets abroad.
d. A more streamlined approach will be sought to facilitate the authorisation of a Presidential Minute when
the Defence Force is put into service in support of
the Police Service.
e. A standing proclamation for the Defence Force to
render immediate assistance in times of disaster or
civil emergency.

##### PARLIAMENTARY OVERSIGHT


###### PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES IN OPERATION

39. Section 199(8) of the 1996 Constitution gives effect to
the principles of transparency and accountability by providing for
multi-party parliamentary committees which have oversight of
the security services in a manner determined by national legislation or the rules and orders of Parliament.

_To give effect to the principles of transparency and account-_
_ability, multi-party parliamentary committees must have_
_oversight of all security services in a manner determined by_
_national legislation or the rules and orders of Parliament.[44]_

40. **The Joint Standing Committee on Defence**
**(JSCD). The JSCD has been established with broad powers of**
oversight that can be used to investigate and make recommendations regarding the budget, functioning of defence, acquisition
and procurement policy, and the state of readiness of defence.
It may perform other functions relating to Parliamentary supervision of the armed forces as prescribed by law.
a. The JSCD derives its powers and functions for oversight of the Defence Force in terms of the Interim
Constitution of 1993.[45] Section 228 was retained as
one of the transitional arrangements[46] carried over
from the 1993 Interim Constitution:
i. Section 228 of the 1993 Interim Constitution
provides that a Joint Standing Committee of
Parliament on Defence shall be established,
consisting of members of all political parties
holding more than 10 seats in the National
Assembly and willing to participate in the
committee.[47]
ii. The Joint Rules of Parliament (Rule 120A) further make provision for the establishment of
the JSCD stating the following: There is a Joint
_Standing Committee on Defence as required by_
_section 228(3) of the Constitution of 1993.[48]_
b. The mandate of the JSCD is found in section 228
(3)(d) of the 1993 Interim Constitution: _The com-_
_mittee shall be competent to investigate and make_
_recommendations regarding the budget functioning,_
_organisation, armaments, policy, morale and state of_

44 The Constitution, 1996, Section 199(8).

45 1993 Interim Constitution, Section 228.

46 1996 Constitution, Schedule 6, Section 24(1).

47 Interim Constitution, 1993, Section 228(3)(a).

48 Joint Rules of Parliament, Rule 120A, p 57.


_preparedness of the National Defence Force and to_
_perform such other functions relating to parliamentary_
_supervision of the Force as may be prescribed by law._
The JSCD therefore has a unique and important
role pertaining to armaments and the preparedness
(readiness) of the Defence Force.

41. **The Portfolio Committee on Defence (PCD). The**
PCD is responsible for monitoring, scrutinising and investigating
defence business. It consequently makes recommendations on
the functions, budgetary allocations, rationalisation and restructuring of the defence organisational structure, policy formulation
and any other relevant matters. It is also empowered to deal
with legislation tabled in Parliament.
a. The PCD derives part of its mandate from that of the
overall National Assembly as contained in Section 55
of the Constitution, 1996 which states that:

_(1)  In exercising its legislative power, the National Assembly_
_may-_
_(a) consider, pass, amend or reject any legislation be-_
_fore the Assembly; and_
_(b) initiate or prepare legislation, except money Bills._
_(2)  The National Assembly must provide for mechanisms-_
_(a)  to ensure that all executive organs of State in the_
_national sphere of government are accountable to_
_it; and_
_(b)  to maintain oversight of-_
_(i)  the exercise of national executive authority, in-_
_cluding the implementation of legislation; and_
_(ii)  any organ of State._

b. The Rules of the National Assembly (Rule 201)
explain the functions of portfolio committees by stating that such committees:[49]

_(a)_ _must deal with bills and other matters falling within its_
_portfolio as are referred to it in terms of the Constitu-_
_tion, legislation, these Rules, the Joint Rules or by reso-_
_lution of the Assembly;_
_(b)_ _must maintain oversight of —_
_(i) the exercise within its portfolio of national execu-_
_tive authority, including the implementation of_
_legislation;_
_(ii) any executive organ of State falling within its_

_portfolio;_
_(iii) any constitutional institution falling within its port-_
_folio; and_
_(iv) any other body or institution in respect of which_
_oversight was assigned to it;_
_(c)_ _may monitor, investigate, enquire into and make_
_recommendations concerning any such executive or-_
_gan of state, constitutional institution or other body or_
_institution, including the legislative programme, bud-_
_get, rationalisation, restructuring, functioning, or-_
_ganisation, structure, staff and policies of such organ_
_of state, institution or other body or institution._

c. The PCD, as a committee of the National Assembly, is responsible for, inter alia, legislative matters
relating to defence; ensuring oversight of Defence
as part of the Executive; and ensuring that the Defence Force is held accountable for its activities. The
PCD is responsible for monitoring Defence, and
scrutinising and investigating what it does. It subsequently makes recommendations on the functions,
budgetary allocations, rationalisation and restructuring of the defence organisational structure, policy
formulation and any other relevant matters. It is
also empowered to deal with legislation tabled in
Parliament.
d. The oversight powers of the PCD are furthermore
contained in Section 56 of the 1996 Constitution:

_The National Assembly (the NCOP and there-_
_fore the JSCD excluded) or any of its committees_
_may- (a) summon any person to appear before_
_it to give evidence on oath or affirmation, or to_
_produce documents; (b) require any person or_
_institution to report to it; (c) compel, in terms_
_of national legislation or the rules and orders,_
_any person or institution to comply with a sum-_
_mons or requirement in terms of paragraph (a)_
_or (b); and (d) receive petitions, representations_
_or submissions from any interested persons or_
_institutions._

42. **Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence (JSCI).**
The JSCI is established by the Intelligence Services Oversight
Act, 1994 (as amended), exercises oversight functions in relation to the intelligence and counter-intelligence functions of
the Security Services, and reports thereon to Parliament.[50] The
function of the JSCI is, inter alia, to review and make recom

mendations regarding interdepartmental cooperation and the
rationalisation and demarcation of functions relating to intelligence and counter-intelligence between the State Security
Agency, the Defence Force and the Police Service.[51]

43. **The Standing Committee on Public Accounts**
**(SCOPA). SCOPA exercises oversight over all executive struc-**
tures and constitutional institutions of the State on behalf of the
Legislature to ensure accountability for resources and financial
management in accordance with the requirements of the Public
Finance Management Act, 1999, as amended.

44. **The Select Committee on Constitutional and**
**Security Affairs (SCOSCA). The SCOSCA in the National**
Council of Provinces has an oversight role on all defence-related
legislation and policy. This oversight role largely focuses on the
implications for the nine provinces of South Africa.

###### PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES NOT YET IN OPERATION

45. **Joint Committee on Oversight of Security Mat-**
**ters. The Joint Rules of Parliament (117-119)[52] provide for a**
joint committee to oversee security matters regarding the Defence Force and the Police Service.
a. Its envisaged functions are as follows:

_The Joint Committee has oversight of the South African_
_National Defence Force and the South African Police_
_Service to give effect to the principles of transparency_
_and accountability as envisaged in section 199(8) of_
_the Constitution, and for that purpose the Committee_
_must meet at least once a year to do an annual review_
_of the security service concerned, including a review of_
_(a) the budget, functioning, organisation, armaments,_
_policy, morale and state of preparedness of the South_
_African National Defence Force; and (b) the budget,_
_functioning, organisation, policy and morale of the_
_South African Police Service.[53]_

b. Joint Rule 119 further states that:

_Rules 117 to 119 will have to stand over until section_
_228 of the 1993 Constitution is repealed. Until such_
_repeal the Joint Standing Committee on Defence es-_
_tablished by that section must perform the oversight_
_function concerning the South African National De-_
_fence Force._

##### C H A P T E R  5

## DEFEND AND PROTECT SOUTH AFRICA


##### INTRODUCTION


1. Defence carries the Constitutional obligation to defend
and protect the Republic, its sovereignty, territorial integrity,
national interests and people against direct threats. The force
design, force structure and establishment table of Defence will
reflect a balance of capabilities required to achieve this, vested
in, inter alia, skilled and appropriately equipped personnel.

2. The defence and protection of South Africa and its vital
interests are the cornerstone of the defence mandate. Provision must be made for contingencies, however unlikely, that
could develop relatively quickly and for those that would take
longer to develop, particularly high-impact contingencies. The
level of defence must therefore be expressed for both a “forcein-being” (short-term force requirement) and a “future-force”
(long-term force requirement) which maintains core defence
appropriate to the inherent unpredictability of the future. Such
capability cannot be created from scratch if the need suddenly


arises. The fundamental characteristics will be:
a. a balanced and sustainable nucleus;
b. an effective intelligence capability to ensure early
warning of potential conflicts and crises;
c. the ability to deal with a range of small-scale contingencies of a short-term nature;
d. the balance to deal with a spectrum of military operations; and
e. the continuous enhancement of leadership, people,
doctrine and equipment in the Defence Force.

3. The defence and protection of South Africa involve the
following tasks: deter and prevent conflict; defend national interests and defend South Africa.


4. South Africa must be able to defend and protect itself
autonomously without having to rely on another country. The
Defence Force will thus be maintained as a formidable, combateffective and healthy fighting force that can decisively and successfully defend and protect South Africa’s land, air, sea and cyber spaces, vital interests and strategic lines of communication.


##### KEY TENETS

5. Defending and protecting South
Africa will take place in accordance with
Article 51 of the United Nations Charter.

6. A balance of comprehensive defence capabilities will be maintained. The
design of these capabilities will be shaped
to achieve the balanced suite of integrated defence effects identified in Chapter 3.
Some will be maintained at a lower level

lowed, if necessary, by deliberate protection through expeditionary forces able to deploy to distant theatres for protracted
periods of time, capable of conducting operations in complex
environments during independent and semi-autonomous deployments. Expeditionary force projection is promoted via air,
sea, road and rail capabilities. (Figure 5-2).

13. Threats to South Africa’s external national interests could
arise within a conflict between South Africa and another state
or as a consequence of conflict between other states or as a
result of domestic conflict within a state. This could include
threat manifestations to the level of limited war or civil war. An
intra-state conflict external to South Africa may imply a multilateral or collaborative initiative or a unilateral initiative to protect a
national interest that is threatened by such conflict.

14. Threats to external national interests remain both plausible and possible. South Africa would seek to first resolve such
threats politically and diplomatically, relying heavily on defence
diplomacy and defence intelligence capabilities. Should the use
of force be necessary, South Africa would prefer to do so collaboratively within a multilateral context. However, unilateral
rapid responce to direct or indirect threats to South Africa’s external national interests must be possible as a last resort. The
response would be tailored to the level of the assessed threat.
South Africa must therefore be in a position to exercise appropriate military force projection and intervene unilaterally should
it be necessary to protect national interests. These interests and
the maximum level of unilateral action would be defined on a
case by case basis.

15. It is envisaged that South Africa’s infrastructure will be
thoroughly integrated with that of the rest of Africa in the near


future. This may result in several vital key
points located outside the national borders of South Africa requiring protection
in time of instability and conflict. This may
include infrastructure consisting of pipelines, railway lines and power lines spanning long distances.

16. The rescue, evacuation and hostage
release of South African nationals abroad
will also require joint capabilities permanently earmarked within the South African
crisis management framework.

17. The protection of national interests
is a standing Defence Force commitment.

###### COLLABORATIVE PROTECTION

18. The primary responsibility to guarantee the safety and security of external national interests ultimately rests with the state
in whose territory such interests are located. If such interests
are threatened beyond the capability of the host state, South
Africa will follow a collaborative and incremental approach to
assist the host state in protecting such interests. Collaboration
will be conducted within the context of bilateral agreements and
under the auspices of the regional, continental and international
security structures, as applicable.

###### DELIBERATE PROTECTION

19. If national interests are threatened beyond the capability
of a host state, a joint intervention force will protect such interests. Such operations will require the rapid deployment of
forces capable of operating over the spectrum of conflict.

###### CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS

20. Forces will be tailored for the specific operation. Highly
mobile, task-specific early-entry forces will be required to provide a rapid response, and will usually be followed-on by medium-combat forces. Heavy-combat forces may in some cases
be required to counter a particular threat. The focus will be
on protection, using offensive tactics as required. Operations
will normally be protracted. Maximum use of intelligence, local
reconnaissance and surveillance and organic firepower, particularly precision indirect firepower, will be required. Forces will
be capable of projecting and sustaining combat power in hostile
territories, with support provided over long distances and the
possible forward positioning of logistics. A combination of air,
sea, rail and road lift will be required. Support via internal waterways may also be required.


-----

##### TASK 3

 DEFEND SOUTH AFRICA


###### DEFENCE EFFECT

21. South Africa’s 1 219 090 km[2] land surface area is defended
in accordance with the Constitution and the principles of international law regulating the use of force, including a broad and
expanding strategy of forward defence informed by the defence
posture. Defence may extend to preventive self-defence if South
Africa must take the initiative to prevent an attack or to deliberately defend when an aggressor exercises the initiative. (Figure
5-3).

###### PREVENTIVE SELF-DEFENCE AGAINST IMMINENT THREATS

22. International law recognises the right of states to act in selfdefence, provided that a threat is imminent and that the actions
taken are proportional to the threat, thus avoiding the use of
excessive force. South Africa will exercise this right as a means of
last resort:
a. after all other practicable means of preventing conflict have failed; or,
b. when the threat poses immense strategic risk.

23. The aim of such preventive operations will be to prevent
or destroy the threat before it can fully manifest itself. Operations
will be focused and of limited duration using small, balanced,
modular force packages of special operations forces employing

_Figure 5-3: Task 3 - Defend South Africa_


focused tactics and high strategic, operational and tactical mobility, and maintaining a high operational tempo. Such operations
would typically comprise raids and strikes by highly trained light
forces, but particular circumstances may require a shift to medium and heavy forces.

24. Operations against, inter alia, acts of terror, insurgency and organised crime will generally rely heavily on Special
Forces[1]. Interdepartmental cooperation between State departments, specifically the security forces, will be vital. Such operations will be conducted on the basis of confirmed and verified
intelligence.

###### DELIBERATE SELF-DEFENCE

25. Deliberate self-defence will be conducted when aggression cannot be deterred or discouraged by political, diplomatic
or other means, when preventive self-defence has failed or
when South Africa cannot avoid entering a state of National Defence. Forces must be able to deploy simultaneously throughout the theatre in day/night and all weather situations to create operational shock and to shatter the aggressor’s cohesion.
South Africa will seek to dominate the airspace and the electromagnetic spectrum and maintain superior situational awareness.

###### CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS

26. The deliberate defence of South Africa will take predominance over all other tasks and is a standing Defence Force commitment. The level of defence required is aligned to circumstances found in overt armed conflict and limited war.

27. Should the spectre of a military
threat manifest against South Africa, South
Africa would seek to either take the initiative to prevent an attack or embark on
deliberate self-defence when an aggressor is able to exercise the initiative. In either case the conduct of operations will
be characterised by a strategy of forward
defence. The operational concept will include fluid, high-mobility and high-tempo
manoeuvre, predominantly offensive operations at the tactical level, maximum use
of superior command and control, intelligence, reconnaissance and surveillance
systems and information operations, and
flexible, responsive sustainment support.

_Figure 5-4: Concepts for Defending South Africa_

28. Major landward combat forces, comprising tactical combat formations, will primarily be deployed by means of road and
rail to and from forward positions. Land forces will be supported
by relevant air and maritime combat support capabilities.

29. **Operations in the Deep.**
a. Deep operations will be executed with predominantly highly mobile forces ranging from Special
Forces to special operations forces projected covertly by air and sea. This may be extended to include medium-combat and heavy-combat forces
with the required combat support[2], joint firepower,
intelligence, mobility and sustainment that contribute to deep strike capabilities.
b. Maximum emphasis will be placed on stand-off and
long-range precision attack.
c. Air, land, sea and special forces capabilities will provide specialised combat capabilities from dispersed
locations, using situational awareness and communications to seize the initiative, maintain the momentum and exploit success.


d. Appropriately protected combat service support[3] will be
agile and versatile and
able to support operations along multiple lines amid rapidly changing support
requirements.

30. Close Operations.
a. The close battle will
be fought mainly by
heavy combat formations with the
required combat
support.
b. All available forces
will be used to find,
fix and destroy the
aggressor swiftly and
decisively. This will
be done by engaging the aggressor in
the battle area and in
the aggressor’s depth
while protecting rear

areas, employing manoeuvre to concentrate force
at the key place and time, and conducting high-intensity and high-tempo operations.
c. Air, land, sea and Special Forces capabilities will
operate from dispersed locations, using space and
air assets for situational awareness and communications to seize the initiative, maintain momentum
and exploit success.
d. Maximum emphasis will be placed on stand-off and
long-range precision attack and rapidly executed
long-range strikes.
e. Combat forces will be sustained from prepositioned
and reserve stocks. The support system will need
to be agile and versatile, and able to support operations along multiple lines amid rapidly changing support requirements.

31. Rear Operations.
a. Rear area operations will be conducted to defend
areas behind the front line of own forces operating externally and/or behind the lines of own forces


2 Combat Support Elements, such as artillery, air defence artillery, signals and military engineers, provide combat support to the combat forces as part of

operating within South Africa’s borders. This could
include elements from all combat services. Joint mission-trained task forces executing these operations
will rely heavily on inherent and task-organised intelligence capabilities.


b. Rear areas and land, sea and air lines of communication (LOCs) in South Africa will be protected by
tailored joint forces. Land LOCs will be protected
by both mobile and static forces.

its 1 219 090 km[2] land surface
area.

3 924 km coastline (at the high
water line), economic exclusive
zone of 1 553 000 km[2 (3)] and
4 340 000 km[2] of maritime
territory.

6. Border safeguarding, in cooperation with contiguous states and other State
departments and agencies, will require
self-supported and sustained joint mobile
forces. Situational awareness, effective
command and control and the sustainment
of operations along extensive borders will
be vital capability requirements. South Africa will further seek to declare a permanent
“Air Border Identification Zone” (ABIZ).

7. Border safeguarding will thus be a standing Defence Force
commitment.


5. Border safeguarding will
entail the enforcement of State
authority with respect to South
Africa’s land, air and maritime
borders. Operations will not
only be conducted on the land
borderline, but will include
rear-area operations to enhance operational manoeuvre.
Border safeguarding will include
the deployment of air assets to
control the airspace and maritime assets for the control of
South Africa’s maritime space.
The critical safeguarding component of the defence mandate
extends to the following:
a. Control of South
Africa’s 4 471 km
land borderline and
the immediate rear
area.
b. Control of South
Africa’s 7 660 km


_Figure 6-2: South Africa’s Borders_


3 Marion and Prince Edward Islands comprise 474 400 km[2].


-----

###### LAND BORDER

8. South Africa’s land
area has 4 471 km of land
borders (Figure 6-2), partly demarcated by rivers
that are largely seasonal in
their capacity to hamper
illicit crossing, and partly
running through areas of
thick bush or mountainous
terrain that are difficult to
monitor or patrol.

9. These borders have
proved vulnerable to a
range of illegal activities,
including rustling of livestock and the smuggling of
narcotics and stolen and
untaxed goods, and also
to illegal migration. They
are equally vulnerable to
the future movement of illicit weapons or explosives
by terror groups. There is
thus a clear need to secure
the land border.

###### AIR BORDER


_Figure 6-3: South Africa’s Safeguearding Domains_


10. South Africa’s land area has an air border of 7 660 km (Figures 6-2 and 6-3), although it is primarily the airspace over the
land border and part of the north-western and north-eastern
coastlines that are particularly vulnerable to illegal intrusion. Air
transportation is growing rapidly with a consequent responsibility to ensure sound airspace awareness, control and protection.

11. There is evidence of smuggling by air (known to be a major problem in other parts of Africa and elsewhere in the world),
particularly regarding narcotics smuggling and human trafficking.
There is also the danger of terror groups moving explosives
or weapons by air. There is thus a clear need to protect South
Africa’s airspace against such intrusions and against possible terror actions such as have been seen in other parts of the world,
particularly during major social and sporting events.

###### MARITIME BORDER

12. The maritime interests of South Africa are derived from its
geographic location, economic infrastructure and geo-political
aspirations and obligations as a regional maritime power. South


Africa has one of the longest coastlines in Africa, stretching for
about 3 924 km at the high water line, from the desert border
with Namibia on the Atlantic coast, southwards around the tip
of Africa and then north to the border with subtropical Mozambique on the Indian Ocean.

13. South Africa has an exclusive economic zone of 1 553
000 km[2] of which the areas around Marion and Prince Edward
Islands comprise 474 400 km[2]. The Atlantic Ocean borders the
west coast, the Indian Ocean borders the east and south coast
and the Southern Ocean surrounds Marion and Prince Edward
Islands. South Africa has tabled its claim to the United Nations
(UN) Convention on the Law of the Sea for the extension of
the continental shelf. This implies that South Africa will have to
exercise control and enforce state authority over 4 340 000 km[2]
of maritime territory (Figure 6-4). This must also be seen in the
context of South Africa being in effect an island economy:
a. directly dependent on seaborne trade for 50% of
its GDP; and substantially more if one considers that
75% of the oil on which economic activity depends,
comes by sea from the Middle East;


-----

_Figure 6-4: South Africa’s Exclusive Economic Zone and Extended Continental Shelf Claim_


b. with an important fishing industry; and
c. with potential for a growing offshore hydrocarbon
sector.

14. South Africa lies along a strategic major international maritime trade route, is located far from its key trade partners whom
it reaches largely by sea, and has international obligations for
providing safety of navigation and ships, ensuring freedom of the
seas and security of shipping, as well as the protection of the
marine environment. South Africa’s national maritime interests
include effective cooperation arrangements with neighbouring
states and territories within and beyond the region and continent
for the management of maritime domain and interests, oceans
management and good order at sea.

15. Maritime piracy, once thought to be a scourge of a bygone
age, has re-emerged in recent years as a serious threat to both
crews and property on the high seas. It is rapidly becoming one
of the most threatening maritime challenges of the 21[st] century.
The threat levels and costs of maritime security call for a comprehensive approach to this global challenge, entailing short- and


long-term initiatives, both onshore and offshore, involving all relevant public and private sector stakeholders.

16. The security of South Africa’s maritime trade routes, and
South Africa’s consequent ability as a nation to trade, is a fundamental matter of national security. As a trading nation, with over
95% of its trade being reliant on maritime trade routes, the security of South Africa and its people is crucially dependent on the
ability to trade, grow the economy, reduce poverty and provide
meaningful work for South Africa’s people. Maritime security is
also linked to commercial fishing and tourism. Consequently,
the freedom of the seas, the right of innocent passage and the
protection of the trade routes for merchant shipping are of vital
national interest to the nation. Many SADC countries, including
land-locked countries, are dependent on maritime trade for their
economic prosperity. Piracy and maritime crime impact negatively on the economies of many African states.

17. The inter-relatedness of South African and African security
implies that all African maritime trade routes, maritime zones,
and where applicable the High Seas, remain an important securi

-----

ty consideration. The Defence Force maritime security responsibilities may thus extend beyond own national responsibilities.

18. Therefore it is recognised that South Africa will have to
contribute significantly to the operationalisation of the SADC
Maritime Security Strategy, the Djibouti Code of Conduct and
the African Integrated Maritime Strategy 2050 in support of the
UN Convention on the Law of the Sea 1982 and the International Maritime Organisation Safety of Life at Sea Convention.
By implication this will mean that the maritime security of South
Africa, SADC and the continent will be ensured by the collective and integrated efforts of all national, regional and continental
organisations charged with such responsibility. Furthermore alliances with regional, continental and international forces operating within the yet-to-be-created “Combined Exclusive Maritime
Zone of Africa” (CEMZA), will act as force multipliers.


22. The outcome of this process may impact on the design,
structure and size of the Defence Force. Should the Defence
Force be required to play a more prominent role, the following
would have to be considered:
a. Protection plans would have to be prepared for
all proclaimed national key points and forces earmarked for their contingent and/or standing protection and required forces and readiness levels determined through collaboration with other security
agencies and private companies on a case by case
basis.
b. The administration, protection oversight, and at
times physical protection of national key points
would include the protection of information and/or
intellectual property as a strategic resource.
c. Contingency plans would be required for all proclaimed national key points.


##### TASK 5

 SAFEGUARD CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE


##### TASK 6

 COOPERATION WITH THE POLICE SERVICE


19. In terms of the National Key Points Act, 1980[4], national
key points are those state, parastatal or private installations and
infrastructure whose security is declared to be vital to the functioning of the South African state, its economy and the wellbeing of its people. Current examples range from the Houses of
Parliament to selected airports, sea ports, power stations, refineries, arms industry factories, and chemical and pharmaceutical

plants. These installations are critical and
must be protected accordingly.

20. The protection of national key points
has been assigned to the South African Police Service, with the Defence Force playing a supportive role (Presidential Minute
No 140 of February 2004).

21. Given that the security paradigm has
radically changed since the introduction
of the National Key Points Act (1980), a
Cabinet decision is awaited on this matter,
with concomitant legislative amendment if
necessary. Specific attention would have
to be given to the definition of a national
key point as well as the necessary powers
to proclaim critical infrastructure as national key points.


###### DEFENCE EFFECT

23. The Constitution[5] mandates that the Defence Force may
be employed for service in the upholding of law and order in the
Republic in cooperation with the Police Service under circumstances set out in law where the said Police Service is unable to


_Figure 6-5: Task 6 - Support to the South African Police Service_

-----

maintain law and order on its own. South Africa and its people
must be made to feel safe through the augmentation of state authority by the Defence Force should the Police Service be unable
to maintain law and order on its own or under circumstances
where the Police Service requires additional security capacity.
(Figure 6-5).

24. The authorisation of the employment of the Defence
Force in cooperation with the Police Service requires that the
Minister of Police formally requests the Minister of Defence for
such employment, or that the President instructs the Defence
Force to be employed in cooperation with of the Police Service.
Such employment must be authorised by the President[6] as Head
of the National Executive and can only be undertaken within the
borders of South Africa. The Police Service is and will remain the
lead department. Employed Defence Force elements will always
remain under own command.

25. The practice of obtaining a Presidential Minute for cooperating with the Police Service will be dealt with in a new streamlined approval process to facilitate the provision of support to
achieve urgent operational objectives.

26. Cooperation with the Police Service is a standing Defence
Force commitment. Defence accordingly has a responsibility to
cooperate with the Police Service and the other Security Services for major events and in the restoration of law and order
when incidents of crime, violence and domestic unrest extend
beyond the control of such Services.

27. Defence cooperation with the Police Service will focus
primarily on major events and dealing with civil and sub-state
threats to the constitutional order. Task-tailored forces may be
formed to rapidly respond to situations, using centralised air or
land mobile forces or forces co-located with the Police Service
within allocated areas of responsibility.

28. Although the possibilities of general civil conflict and insurgency are remote, their occurrence would have high impact,
requiring a significant and rapid response by the Defence Force
to restore and maintain law and order.

29. The deployment of the Defence Force in cooperation with
the Police Service requires existing legislation to be enhanced in
order to ensure that Defence Force members are adequately
protected when executing such tasks.

6 The Constitution, 1996, Section 201(2)(b).


###### MAJOR EVENTS

30. From time to time the Police Service may require security
support during the hosting of major public events. The Defence
Force will provide forces to be co-located with Police Service
elements and/or other departments within allocated areas of responsibility. Forces employed for this purpose will be tailored to
the mission.

###### COOPERATION WITH SPECIALIST POLICE TASK FORCES

31. From time to time the Defence Force is required to work
with the various Police Specialist Task Forces, both standing task
forces and temporary task forces that are mission-specific, such
as to counter rhino poaching. This cooperation with the Police
Service may extend to reciprocal training initiatives related to
task force activities. The short response times of such engagements require close coordination between the Defence Force
and the Police Service.

###### THREATS TO CIVIL ORDER

32. The domestic security environment is characterised by
normal political and economic competition found in a democratic and peaceful state.

33. The Defence Force may be constitutionally employed for
service in instances where the Police Service is no longer able to
uphold law and order. The Defence Force will primarily cooperate with the Police Service from its collateral capability and will
not generally structure for this task. However, given the Defence
Force’s role in Fighting-In-Built-Up-Areas (FIBUA), some specialised additional equipment will be needed.


##### TASK 7

 ENSURE INFORMATION SECURITY


###### DEFENCE EFFECT

34. South Africa’s information and communication systems,
technology and infrastructure are protected.

35. Information and communication systems and technology
are tools enabling command and control to be exerted in warfare. They provide the infrastructure for weapon systems and


-----

sensors to exchange relevant data and allow decision-makers to
use data, information and ultimately intelligence to visualise the
battlefield and make successful military decisions (Figure 6-6).
This is applicable in both weapon and administration systems,
and enhanced by technology support systems like Health Informatics, Telehealth and Health Intelligence.

36. Although the terms cyber-warfare, cyber-defence or
cyber-attack are often used in everyday language, the broad
military concept used in this goal is Information Warfare, a term
which covers a broad range of operations to be carried out
within the Information Sphere (commonly also known as the
InfoSphere). Military forces strive to achieve necessary information superiority so as to ensure own freedom of action and to
ensure strategic dominance and success.

37. Information security is ensured by dominating the electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) and the network information systems
spectrums (also known as the cyberspace), as well as influencing
human beliefs and behaviour in the physical, information and
cognitive (psychological) domains. The following is achieved:
a. Potential information onslaughts are deterred.
b. Defence information and communication assets and
processes are defended and protected and information superiority is achieved.
c. Information and communication assets and processes of an opposing force are disrupted, destroyed,

_Figure 6-6: Task 7 - Ensure Information Security_

7 Government Gazette 32999 dated 05 March 2010, Section 5(1).


denied and exploited and own information superiority is enhanced.

38. Defence further plays a supportive role with other security agencies in the protection of government information and
promotion of broader information security in the South African
society. This supportive role is defined in the National CyberSecurity Policy Framework, which seeks to enable the development of an information society that takes into account the fundamental rights of every South African citizen to privacy, security,
dignity, access to information, the right to communication and
freedom of expression. The framework seeks to ensure that
Government, business and civil society are able to enjoy the full
benefits of a safe and secure cyberspace through working together to understand and address the risks, reduce the benefits
to criminals and seize opportunities in cyberspace to enhance
South Africa’s overall security and safety, including its economic
wellbeing.

###### State Requirement

39. The risk of South Africa’s communications and electronic
data being subjected to a cyber-attack remains a reality. The
Protection of Information Bill refers to state information requiring protection against unlawful alteration, destruction or loss[7]. It
is of critical importance that the concept of Information Operations be established at national level to coordinate State activities
in the InfoSphere (Figure 6-7). Information Operations can thus be applied as
the coordinating body to ensure that the
security cluster and civil society will collaboratively define national information
security goals to protect information as a
strategic resource.

40. The protection of state information against a cyber-threat is the primary
responsibility of the State Security Agency through Electronic Communications
Security (Pty) Ltd (COMSEC Pty Ltd).
COMSEC was established in 2002 as a
private company with the primary purpose of ensuring that critical electronic
communications of the State are secure
and protected. The functions of COMSEC are[8]:

## REGIONAL AND CONTINENTAL PEACE AND SECURITY


##### INTRODUCTION


1. The interdependent and uncertain 21[st] century world
produces challenges which are complex and global in nature,
threatening collective wellbeing and placing increased pressure
on the global system of governance. These challenges encompass human security issues such as environmental sustainability,
poverty alleviation, development, political and economic crises,
human and gender rights violations, and the proliferation of
small arms and weapons of mass destruction. Multilateral organisations remain commited to seeking equitable solutions to
global problems.

2. In an era of globalisation and interdependency, many
threats to peace and stability, such as global poverty, climatic
change or acts of terror, cannot be effectively addressed unilaterally by individual states. States must collaborate in the pursuit
and promotion of common security ideals and against threats to


security. A shared concept of security, common threat analysis
and an agreed-upon set of principles and/or rules, enable the
collective resolution of conflict and the countering of security
threats. Such collective action requires internationally-mandated initiatives that are legitimate, effective, sustainable and which
share the cost and resource burden amongst states.


3. South Africa’s foreign policy, shaped by its own domestic
priorities, seeks a “better Africa in a better world”. Economic
integration, development, peace and security are cornerstones
of this policy. South Africa will thus continue to support regional
and continental conflict resolution, strengthen regional integration, significantly increase intra-African trade and champion sustainable development.

4. South Africa’s engagement with other states will be one
of peaceful relations, adherence to international law on armed
conflict and the pursuit of international treaties to which it is
party. South Africa recognises that development and stability are


##### KEY TENETS


-----

inextricably linked and mutually reinforcing, hence the commitment to the promotion of continental and regional security.

5. South Africa encourages the multilateral pursuit of global
solutions. South Africa also remains committed to the international systems of global governance for the promotion and protection of human rights through equal emphasis on civil, political,
social, economic and cultural rights.

6. South Africa’s resolve to promote peace, security and development on the continent will be demonstrated through unambiguous policy statements, the maintenance and employment
of a credible intervention capability, the prepositioning of forces
and the contribution of South African forces to various forms of
peace missions.

7. International conflict prevention and crisis management require the provision of joint forces with escalation, enforcement
and sustainment capabilities for operations in different operational theatres at the same time. External support will be relied on if
necessary.

8. **Multilateral Level. South Africa will consequently seek**
to enhance its strategic influence through shaping the multilateral
security agenda, pursuing critical multilateral security objectives,
developing regional and continental partnerships and directed
participation in selected bilateral mechanisms. The following will
be pursued:
a. Promotion of peace, security and confidence-building through constructive dialogue aimed at nurturing sound diplomatic relations and pursuing South
Africa’s foreign policy principles and objectives.
b. Commitment to the resolution of conflict in terms
of the UN Charter and international and customary
international law and, as far as possible, employing
military force within a multinational framework.
c. Peaceful resolution of conflicts through recognised
international instruments and mechanisms.
d. Support to government diplomatic initiatives through
participation in multilateral institutions such as the
SADC, AU and UN.
e. Particular diligence in furthering the objectives of International Humanitarian Law.
f. Adherence to national responsibilities that arise from
international instruments, especially during times of
conflict.
g. Protection of the civilian population and other
non-combatants and the reduction of unnecessary
suffering.
h. UN peacekeeping within the voluntary UN Standby
Arrangements System, in turn requiring South Africa to identify capacity that can be earmarked for
the creation of joint multinational forces under a UN


###### DEFENCE EFFECT

10. South Africa enhances its strategic influence through the
execution of a strengthened defence diplomacy strategy which
enhances South Africa’s ability to shape the multilateral security
agenda, pursue critical multilateral security objectives, capacitate
multilateral institutions, develop regional and continental partnerships and direct participation in selected bilateral mechanisms.
(Figure 7-1).

###### DIRECTING AND MANAGING DEFENCE DIPLOMACY

11. South Africa’s contribution to the prevention and resolution of conflict will be enhanced through an integration of its diplomatic, military and other efforts, in a complementary manner,
and in instances supported by appropriate military capabilities,
that strengthen South Africa’s capacity to influence international developments. This requires a defence diplomacy capability
whose strategy and main effort focus on those national priorities
where defence can add the most value. Defence diplomacy efforts will further centre on fostering long-standing relationships
with key African states and other strategic partners.

12. A **defence diplomacy strategy will be developed to**
address defence bilateral and multilateral priorities. These will
include:
a. Pursuing the priorities of government as expressed in
its Medium-Term Strategic Framework.
b. Pursuing the priorities of the Executive Authority responsible for defence.
c. Deployment of defence personnel into multilateral
security institutions.
d. The pursuit of identified multilateral security
objectives.


mandate. Similar arrangements may be pursued at
the AU or SADC levels.

9. **Continental and Regional Level. Since the security of**
South Africa is inextricably linked to that of the African continent
and the developing world, South Africa must:
a. Help shape the continental and regional security and
developmental agenda through effective participation in security mechanisms.
b. Seek UN Security Council or AU Peace and Security
Council mandates for peace missions and concomitant security sector reform (SSR) and post-conflict
reconstruction and development (PCRD).

###### ELEMENTS OF THE DEFENCE DIPLOMACY STRATEGY

 Multilateral Security

16. South Africa recognises the need to enhance its international contribution through candidatures and the secondment
of South Africans to positions in regional, continental and global
governance institutions. Defence, in pursuit of the African Agenda, will prioritise enhanced representation at the UN Department of Peacekeeping Operations, the AU Peace and Security
Council and the SADC Organ.


-----

17. **The United Nations (UN).**
a. The UN system, through its universal membership
and broad mandate, occupies the central and indispensable role in the global system of governance.
The UN constitutes the most prominent global
organisation dedicated to the principles of collective security. In pursuit of enhanced continental and
global security, South Africa will consequently remain
a significant and responsible troop contributor to UN
missions in Africa and will give consideration to participation in the UN Standby Arrangement System.
b. South Africa will:
i. Continue the trend of being a significant and
responsible troop contributor to UN-mandated and -assessed missions, within the framework of government objectives and interests.
ii. Seek to significantly enhance its representation in the UN Department of Peacekeeping
Operations.

18. The African Union (AU).
a. South Africa will continue to champion the role of
the AU as the primary organisation for coordinating
continental positions and coordination with development partners. The AU will be the primary mechanism for South Africa’s continental engagement.
b. Security is promoted by the AU Peace and Security
Council (PSC) through timely and effective response
to conflicts and crises in Africa. The work of the AU
PSC is promoted through its mechanisms: the Panel
of the Wise, the African Standby Force (ASF), the
Continental Early Warning System (CEWS), the Military Staff Committee (MSC), and the Peace Fund.
c. South Africa will intensify its engagements in the AU
and its structures towards building African security
and the social and economic development of the
continent. South Africa will specifically:
i. Continue to support the AU PSC and its
mechanisms, playing a specific role in the
MSC, CEWS and the ASF.
ii. Work with SADC and its member states to
maintain the readiness of the SADC Standby
Force (SADC SF).
iii. Contribute to the capacity of the CEWS.

19. The Southern African Development Community
**(SADC).**
a. South Africa is committed to establishing SADC as
the firm base for the engagement of the continent.
The consolidation of the security structures and

1 Signed by the SADC Heads of State in August 2003.


institutions of SADC is thus of paramount importance. Stability in SADC will be promoted through:
the conclusion of treaties such as the SADC Mutual
Defence Pact[1]; the conclusion of individual bilateral
agreements; and participation in SADC Standby
Force activities. South Africa will pursue initiatives
to create a firm SADC defence and security sector
foundation.
b. South Africa will enhance its contribution to the Inter-State Defence and Security Committee (ISDSC),
including the Defence Sub-Committee and its subsub-committees and working groups.
c. South Africa will continue its current contribution to
the SADC Standby Force (Figure 7-2) and will put
significant effort into establishing the SADC Standby
Force as a standing multinational force in terms of
South Africa’s pledges. South Africa will specifically
advocate for the migration of the current Planning Element to a functional brigade headquarters capable
of conducting regular force preparation, mobilisation
of forces when required and execution of command
and control over deployed forces. To this end South
Africa will:
i. Pledge continuous support to the SADC
Standby Force.
ii. Exchange and train personnel.
iii. Offer to permanently supply the Brigade Tactical Headquarters to the SADC Standby Force.
iv. Avail South African facilities for the planning and
hosting of regional military exercises in pursuit
of the SADC Standby Force and other security
objectives.
v. Establish a strategic relationship between the
South African Peace Mission Training Centre
in Thaba Tshwane and the SADC Regional
Peacekeeping Training Centre in Harare, including the exchange of Directing Staff.
vi. Significantly contribute to the establishment of
the SADC Logistic Base.
vii. Develop mutually compatible SADC doctrine
and tactics, techniques and procedures.
viii. Attach or second subject-matter experts as
may be required for periods of shorter duration, examples of potential subjects being doctrine development, maritime security, nuclear
and biological defence and military health protection, amongst others.
ix. Cooperate with regional defence industries to
promote interoperability.
x. Advocate the expansion of SADC’s Special


-----

_Figure 7-2: South Africa’s current SADC Standby Force Pledge_

Forces capability in order to create a “rapid
reaction” capability within the regional and
sub-regional AU peace, safety and security architecture. To this end:
(1) The establishment of a formal Special
Forces structure in the Operations SubSub-Committee of the ISDSC.
(2) The secondment of Special Forces planners to the SADC Standby Force HQ.
d. South Africa will actively contribute to the development of the Civilian Component of the SADC
Standby Force, including but not exclusively, within
the Planning Element in Gaborone.

###### Regional and Continental Partnerships

20. South Africa will continue to advance common African positions through its structured bilateral activities in the belief that
regional defence partnership initiatives will further peace, stability and the broad security objectives and diplomatic initiatives of
Government.

21. Defence cooperation within SADC, Africa and beyond,
is viewed as a foundation for the achievement of peace and security. The signing and implementation of international defence
agreements are thus a critical policy action and an important
component of regional confidence building.


22. South Africa will play a supportive
role to regional and continental partners.
Defence will pursue cooperation in the
fields of logistics, training and education,
intelligence, combined exercises, secondment of personnel, and the development
of common doctrine and operational
procedures.
a. **Contiguous States.**
i. Defence will pursue
specific security arrangements with countries
with whom common
borders are shared and
with whom coordinated
cooperation on matters
such as defence, state
security, immigration,
civilian policing, customs
and ports of entry is
necessary.
ii. Specific cooperative operations may take place
to counter imminent

threats or wider criminality such as poaching,
stock-theft, illegal movement of people and
goods, as well as maritime security and piracy.
b. **Wider SADC. Defence will similarly prioritise bi-**
lateral relations within the SADC region through the
vigorous and robust pursuit of bilaterally agreed cooperation plans.
c. **Partnerships beyond SADC.**
i. Defence partnerships will also be pursued
with like-minded states beyond SADC that
are committed to the common values of democracy, human rights, peace and stability,
and civil control of the armed forces.
ii. Defence will specifically seek strategic partnerships with countries which have the means to
play a leadership role in their region or on the
continent, who demonstrate the political will
to be a force for good in the pursuit of these
ideals, who promote peace, security and development and whose leadership role has international consequences or influence.
iii. Senior defence personnel may be deployed
as representatives to such countries.
d. **Bilateral Confidence and Security Build-**
**ing Measures (CSBMs). Defence will thus pur-**
sue the implementation of CSBMs to provide for
greater transparency and cooperation on regional


-----

and continental military matters, thereby promoting
collective confidence and stability. A range of defence
CSBMs can be pursued with partner nations, including the following:
i. Defence and security agreements and cooperation mechanisms.
ii. Intelligence cooperation and exchanges, a (regional) communications network, a “crisis hotline”, and established procedures for dealing
with unusual or unscheduled military incidents.
iii. Structured annual consultations and exchanges
of information on threat perceptions, defence
budgets, force structure, modernisation plans,
general defence cooperation, high-level visits
and troop deployments.
iv. Military assistance, exchanges and education
and training cooperation.
v. Combined military exercises and/or on-site
observation of military exercises and specified
activities.
vi. Disaster and humanitarian assistance.
vii. Common procurement of defence systems
and common technology programmes.
viii. Collaboration in the implementation of the AU
and SADC Maritime Security Strategies.

###### Relationships beyond Africa

23. South Africa will seek to establish and maintain defence cooperation with key nations beyond Africa as identified in the context of foreign policy. This will be a balance of existing strategic
partners in the Americas, the Middle East, expanded Europe and
Asia, and the emergent powers of the South, in particular the
BRICS countries. In addition to national foreign policy objectives,
these initiatives will also be driven by the military requirement for
lifecycle support to prime mission equipment, force preparation
and force employment cooperation in terms of security objectives, defence education and training requirements and cooperation with partners on various military general assistance missions.
a. It will be critical for South Africa to enhance its defence relations with key partners on the continent as
well as with both the established developed partners
and the emergent partners of the developing world.
b. In terms of established partners, characterised mostly
by traditional relationships and on a perceived common outlook on global issues, these well-established
ties of friendship and mutual understanding will be
strengthened through continued cooperation in bilateral and multilateral areas, with the emphasis being placed on interactions as equal partners.
c. In terms of the emergent partners, the strategic focus will be aimed both at bilateral defence relations
and at the deepening of trade and investment link

###### DEFENCE EFFECT

28. South Africa’s resolve to promote peace, security and development on the continent is demonstrated through unambiguous policy statements, the maintenance and employment of a
credible crisis-response capability, the prepositioning of forces
and the contribution of South African forces to various forms
of peace missions. South Africa, in appropriate circumstances,
makes elements of its Defence Force available to peace support
operations of the UN and AU, employs armed force to assist
other countries faced with insecurity and conducts internationally
agreed upon constabulary operations. (Figure 7-3).


ages in the defence industry sector, where there is
potential for future growth and where synergies and
complementarities in product and technologies exist.

###### Defence Industry Cooperation

24. Rigorous, focused, coordinated and visible government involvement and political support and commitment are necessary
for the successful marketing of South African armaments and related equipment and services. Government will actively assist the
domestic defence industry with the international marketing of armaments and actively support specific marketing initiatives by the
defence industry. Domestic user participation, coordination and
government export support measures will require collaborative
government involvement.

25. Government has an obligation to exercise control over the
defence industry as well as actively assist it in obtaining access to
key markets. Government will thus assist the defence industry by
facilitating initiatives that support political, economic and military
objectives such as the maintenance of strategic defence technologies and capabilities.

26. The pursuit of joint procurement programmes in the
SADC region will be an important initiative, with the emphasis on the acquisition of interoperable equipment as a stepping
stone to regional interoperability and a functional SADC Standby
Force.

###### Defence Attachés

27. South Africa’s future defence attachés will be stringently
selected for their military knowledge and operational experience
and their ability to champion South Africa and further foreign
policy, defence diplomacy and international objectives.


##### TASK 9

 CONTRIBUTE TO PEACE AND STABILITY


-----

_Figure 7-3: Task 9 - Contribute to Peace and Stability_

29. The promotion of peace and stability in the region and
on the continent is a key component of South Africa’s foreign
policy. Ideally the risk of inter-state conflict on the continent will
be managed collectively, preferably by diplomatic means, but if
all else fails, intervention in the form of a peace mission may be
required.

30. It is important to note that inter-state armed conflict within the wider SADC remains unlikely. However, general civil
conflict in SADC is considered a higher risk contingency. Furthermore, Defence must be able to contribute to multinational
peace missions to the level of peace enforcement in conflict involving African states outside of SADC in the sub-Sahara region.

31. In general, threats to security closer to South Africa will
enjoy priority. Defence deployments beyond Africa will be exceptional, of limited scale and duration, and subject to other
priorities.

32. Defence must be able to provide forces for a range of
conflict that may occur on the continent.  Where the use of
force is required to maintain peace or to separate belligerent
parties, South Africa may consider doing so in terms of a multilateral mandate, a specific Defence Pact or as part of a ‘coalition of the willing’ established under a UN or AU mandate in
terms of Chapter 6, 7 or 8 of the UN Charter.  Involvement is
discretionary and will be determined in light of the specific situation and concurrent commitments. It may also include unilateral


intervention should pressing circumstances
so dictate. However, the commitment cannot be open-ended. Criteria for involvement in specific missions and a predetermined maximum level of involvement will
be set by Government.

33. South Africa’s contribution may range
from headquarters staff at various levels,
observers and specialist military elements,
to robust combat forces with inherent support capabilities. South Africa will plan to
assume command of multilateral forces at
the brigade level, where possible. In some
instances where South Africa has specialist capabilities that are not readily available
elsewhere, such as military engineering
and military health, these force structure
elements may be maintained at a higher
level of capacity than normally would be
required in the Defence Force.

34. In this context, regional and conti
nental defence cooperation and the participation in collective
defence measures and peace missions will enjoy significant priority as a standing Defence Force commitment.

35. South Africa, in appropriate circumstances, will make
elements of its Defence Force available to the peace support
operations of the UN and AU; employ armed force to assist
other countries faced with insecurity; and conduct internationally agreed-upon constabulary operations. South Africa may thus
consider contributing to:
a. Shaping the international, continental and regional
security agenda.
b. Interventions under grave circumstances.
c. Peace missions and post-conflict development.
d. Reconstruction of the security sector.
e. Regional humanitarian assistance and disaster relief.
f. General military assistance missions.
g. Regional security initiatives, such as maritime security and anti-piracy operations.

36. Defence will continue supporting the UN and the AU
through:
a. Contributing headquarters staff, formed units and
specialised elements to mandated and assessed
missions.
b. Providing technical and specialist support and facilitating industrial support to UN and AU forces.


-----

###### INTERVENTION UNDER GRAVE CIRCUMSTANCES

37. The principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of
sovereign states and the commitment to the peaceful resolution
of conflict are enshrined in the UN Charter and the Constitutive
Act of the AU. Military interventions in other states may, however, be justified in extreme circumstances where all attempts for
the peaceful resolution of conflict have failed.

38. Unilateral action can only be justified in exceptional circumstances as defined in Article 51 of the UN Charter. Circumstances that could legally justify such action include serious
threats to international peace, severe intra-state violence and
gross violations of human rights.
a. Chapter 8 of the UN Charter accordingly provides
for regional enforcement actions, which may include
the use of force, to maintain or restore international
peace and security where pacific measures have
failed or are deemed inadequate.
b. The AU Non-Aggression and Common Defence
Pact, in pursuance of the Constitutive Act of the AU[2]
and the Protocol relating to the Establishment of the
PSC[3], promotes cooperation among the Member
States in the areas of non-aggression and common
defence, the promotion of peaceful co-existence
in Africa, the prevention of conflicts of inter-state
or intra-state nature, the resolution of disputes by
peaceful means and the definition of a framework
under which the Union may intervene or authorise
intervention, in preventing or addressing situations of
aggression[4].
c. The SADC Protocol on Politics, Defence and Security Cooperation[5] and the SADC Mutual Defence
Pact[6] likewise provide for enforcement action as a
means of last resort where peaceful means of resolving significant inter- or intra-state conflict, as defined
in the Protocol, have failed.
d. South Africa will seek UN Security Council and/or
AU Peace and Security Council endorsement of any
collaborative or unilateral intervention that may be
necessary. The timing of such endorsement may depend on the gravity and urgency of the intervention,
and does not preclude urgent intervention in grave
circumstances prior to multilateral endorsement.

39. While a single country might in some cases be the major
contributor, such operations will almost invariably be joint, inter
2 AU Non-Aggression and Common Defence Pact, Article 4(h).

departmental, inter-agency and multinational (JI[2]M) in nature. In
some cases South Africa may thus wish to exercise the option
of assuming command responsibility as a framework nation and
plan to provide defence combat capabilities across the entire task
spectrum, into which contributions of other nations can be integrated in a flexible and synergetic manner.

40. Forces employed for a deliberate intervention should be
tailored to the mission.
a. Deployment to and build-up in theatre should be
rapid to ensure a preponderance of power to deter
the belligerents and provide the ability to operate simultaneously throughout the theatre.
b. Intervention forces should be highly skilled and
trained, with a capacity for network-enabled
operations.
c. While special operations forces can be used as earlyentry forces, they should be augmented by mediumand heavy-combat forces as the situation requires.
d. Superior command and control, protection, firepower (including non-lethal and precision capabilities), mobility and manoeuvre, information and intelligence, and sustainment are critical.
e. Deployed forces should be capable of semi-autonomous and protracted independent operations. Air,
sea and land force projection capabilities will be required to deploy and support such operations and
such capabilities should be able to execute defence
operations singularly or jointly.

###### PEACE MISSIONS AND RECONSTRUCTION

41. Peace missions include a wide spectrum of operations from
the provision of observers, to peacekeeping under Chapter 6 of
the UN Charter, to peace enforcement in a hostile environment
under Chapter 7 of the Charter. A purely military approach to
peace support operations, which ignores the developmental,
economic and governance aspects of peace-building, will not
effectively achieve lasting stability and conditions of human security. A multidimensional developmental approach will be pursued with military and civilian bodies cooperating to accelerate
capacity-building and socio-economic development.

42. Defence will pursue reconstruction and create conditions
conducive to long-term peace and security building in support
of peacekeeping objectives. The process of providing critical humanitarian assistance and reconstruction capabilities during and
immediately after military operations will enable and reinforce


5 SADC Protocol on Politics, Defence and Security Cooperation, Article 11(3)(c)&(d).

6 SADC MDP, Article 7(1)&(2).


-----

the process of development and reconstruction. Developmental peacekeeping will inevitably be executed in a JI[2]M context.

43. Defence can contribute greatly to socio-economic development by employing its diverse capabilities, such as its planning
capability, in parallel with peace-operation forces. This would
usually deploy as part of the South African contingent forces but
may in exceptional cases deploy on its own as part of the South
African contribution to a multinational HQ. Its activities will in
most cases be influenced by the civil component of an integrated multinational HQ.

###### SECURITY SECTOR REFORM

44. South Africa believes that security is underpinned by the
inter-related factors of peace and stability, development, democracy and good governance. South Africa undertakes security sector reform (SSR) within the Policy Framework for Reconstruction and Development of the AU and SSR guidelines of
other relevant multilateral organisations, in particular the UN.

45. In countries emerging from conflict the security sector is
often seriously deficient. South Africa accordingly views SSR as
an indispensable aspect of conflict resolution and the creation of
sustainable security. The security sector of a country, comprising the armed forces, police, intelligence services, judiciary and
prisons services, plays a key role in maintaining peace, stability
and the rule of law. The functionality of the security sector is
thus of vital importance and the ultimate objective of SSR is thus


to create a secure and stable environment that is conducive to:
a. human-centred and infrastructural development;
b. poverty alleviation and economic growth; and
c. institutionalisation of representative, accountable
and transparent governance that is based on the
rule of law and democratic principles.

46. The aim of SSR is to reposition the security sector to provide security to the state and society in an effective and efficient
manner, within the framework of democratic civilian principles.

47. Defence, together with the post-conflict country, its government and security organs, and other contributing countries
will contribute to the reconstruction of the security sector
through:
a. disarmament;
b. the demobilisation and reintegration of
ex-combatants;
c. curbing the proliferation of small arms and light
weapons; and
d. training constituted forces to function as a professional military force within a democratic system.

###### GENERAL MILITARY ASSISTANCE MISSIONS

48. South Africa may consider the deployment of general
military assistance missions on a bilateral level where training
teams are deployed for specific tasks and specific periods. Training could range from bridging training, to basic training and to
sophisticated training at all levels.

primarily from human security and developmental challenges.
The promotion of domestic peace, stability, growth and devel

-----

opment thus encompasses a variety of tasks falling within the
constitutional mandate of the Defence Force. These include assistance to Government departments as may be required for
emergency relief, the maintenance of essential services and a
variety of contingent peacetime tasks.

3. Defence will support civil authority, on the basis of a written request between the respective Ministers, when a situation
or an emergency is beyond the affected department’s capabilities. Other government departments will act as lead departments with Defence in support of their activities. Defence Force
elements will remain under own command. Typical tasks in support of civil authorities are consequence management and relief
after man-made and natural disasters, support to special events,
the protection of life and property and the augmentation of vital
services during strikes. Such support will be time-bound and
subject to statute, executive controls and legislative oversight.

###### INTERNATIONAL HYDROGRAPHIC AND NAUTICAL CHARTING OBLIGATIONS

4. **International Convention on the Safety of Life at**
**Sea (SOLAS). The International Maritime Organisation (IMO)**
promulgated the SOLAS. The SOLAS Convention (in its successive forms) is generally regarded as the most important of all international treaties concerning the safety of shipping. Through its
accession to the SOLAS and its revisions, South Africa is bound
to the obligations thereof.
a. **SOLAS Chapter V requires governments to**
ensure that all vessels are sufficiently and efficiently
manned from a safety point of view. It places requirements on all vessels regarding voyage and
passage planning, expecting a careful assessment of
any proposed voyages by all who put to sea. Every
mariner must take account of all potential dangers to
navigation, weather forecasts, tidal predictions, the
competence of the crew, and all other relevant factors. It also adds an obligation for all vessels’ masters
to offer assistance to those in distress and controls
the use of lifesaving signals and has specific requirements regarding danger and distress messages.
b. **SOLAS Chapter V, Regulation 4 informs South**
Africa’s responsibilities with respect to the promulgation of navigational warnings. In accordance with
this regulation, South Africa will take all steps necessary to ensure that, when intelligence of any dangers
is received from whatever reliable source, it will be
promptly brought to the knowledge of those concerned and communicated to other interested governments. The South African Navy (Hydrographic
Office) consequently assumes responsibility, on behalf of the State, to provide:
i. Various hydrographic products, such as the
consolidation of navigational, hazard or mari

time warning data into regular formal navigational safety publications or promulgation as
Navigational Warnings or Notices to Mariners.
ii. A national tidal network of tide gauges where
data sets are received in near real time from
instruments and used to monitor sea level and
refine tidal predictions for publishing as tide tables for South African and Namibian harbours.
c. **SOLAS Chapter V, Regulation 9 informs South**
Africa’s obligation in terms of hydrographic services
to be provided. This entails the collection and compilation of hydrographic data and the publication,
dissemination and keeping up to date of all nautical
information necessary for safe navigation. The South
African Navy (Hydrographic Office) consequently assumes responsibility, on behalf of the State, to carrying out the following nautical and hydrographic services, in the manner most suitable for the purpose of
aiding navigation:
i. Ensure that hydrographic surveying is carried
out, as far as possible, adequate to the requirements of safe navigation.
ii. Prepare and issue official nautical charts, sailing
directions, lists of lights, tide tables and other
official nautical publications, where applicable,
satisfying the needs of safe navigation.
iii. Promulgate notices to mariners in order to
keep official nautical charts and publications up
to date.
iv. Provide data management arrangements to
support these services.
v. Ensure the greatest possible uniformity in
charts and nautical publications and take into
account, whenever possible, the relevant international resolutions and recommendations.
vi. Coordinate their activities to the greatest
possible degree in order to ensure that hydrographic and nautical information is made
available on a world-wide scale as timeously,
reliably and unambiguously as possible.

5. **International Hydrographic Organisation (IHO).**
a. South Africa has been an IHO Member State since
1951. An agreement was consequently set up between the Minister of Defence and the Minister of
Transport in 1954 wherein the South African Navy
assumed responsibility for the hydrographic obligations of the Republic. This function is currently performed by the South African Navy Hydrographer,
yet this arrangement has never been formalised in
legislation.
b. The IHO has allocated responsibility for IHO charting of Region H to South Africa, as well as contributing member responsibilities for IHO Charting Region


-----

M (Antarctica) and the coordination of Navigation
Area VII within the World-Wide Navigational Warning System (Maritime Safety Information). These
three obligations are graphically described in Figure
8-2 below.

6. South Africa will, within the confines of the IHO, engage
on the reapportionment of IHO charting responsibilities in the
Southern African region.

7. South Africa’s international hydrographic and nautical charting obligations, responsibilities and liabilities must be
brought into national law. Such national legislation must provide
for:
a. South Africa’s compliance with its international hydrographic surveying and nautical cartography obligations arising from its membership of the IIHO and
the IMO.
b. The appointment of the South African Navy Hydrographer as the National Hydrographer of the
Republic.
c. The role and functions of the National Hydrographer.
d. The hydrographic services to be provided.
e. The setting of hydrographic standards and
competence.


f. Protection of survey marks and other hydrographic
measures.
g. The limitation of civil liability.
h. Funding of the capability.
i. Secondment of hydrographers to other countries
and international hydrographic institutions.
j. International cooperation on hydrographic matters.

###### MARITIME AND AERONAUTICAL SEARCH AND RESCUE OBLIGATIONS

8. The South African Maritime and Aeronautical Search and
Rescue Act, 2002[1] provides that the Minister of Transport must
by notice in the Gazette, as well as in relevant maritime and
aeronautical publications, publish the search and rescue regions
within which search and rescue services will be provided in
terms of the responsibility of the Republic as laid down by the
International Civil Aviation Organisation and the IMO (Figure
8-2).

9. The South African Search and Rescue Organisa**tion (SASAR)[2] ensures a coordinated and effective maritime**
and aeronautical search and rescue service within the South African search and rescue regions[3]. SASAR may, for purposes of any
aeronautical or maritime search and rescue operation, request

any military aircraft or vessel
to assist in any operation[4].
Furthermore, diverse ad
hoc search and rescue services are provided, where
the situation merits, to entities such as emergency and
rescue services.

10. South Africa will engage with the Republic of
Brazil concerning bilateral
cooperation in the western areas of South Africa’s
responsibility.

11. Land, aeronautical,
maritime and other ad hoc
search and rescue support
is a standing Defence Force
commitment. The Defence
Force must therefore pro

vide land, aviation and maritime search and rescue capabilities
when required. Such capabilities will generally be provided
through its collateral capability.

###### INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW (IHL) OBLIGATIONS

12. The Defence Force is re quired to be a disciplined, professional, well-trained and well-equipped fighting force operating
within the boundaries set by domestic and international law and
ethical standards. Given that South Africa’s broad security goals
include the protection of South Africa, its citizens, their property
and its national interests, South Africa will comply with its obligations under international law and treaties. IHL is contained chiefly
in the Geneva Conventions and other similar IHL instruments,
which seek to regulate the conduct of armed conflict and the
rights and duties of belligerent parties with reference to humanitarian concerns. The Geneva Conventions have been universally
ratified, pending South Sudan’s accession.

13. A major part of IHL is contained in the four Geneva Conventions of 1949, which are regarded as customary international
law and thus binding on all states. The Conventions have been


developed and supplemented
by further treaties, namely the
**two Additional Protocols**
**of 1977. The** **third Addi-**
**tional Protocol of 2005**
establishes the Red Crystal
emblem with equal status to
the Red Cross emblem, compelling that the emblem must
be respected and protected.

14. South Africa has ratified
the Geneva Conventions and
has recently brought them
into domestic law through
the promulgation of the Implementation of the Geneva
Conventions Act, 2012 (Act
08 of 2012). The Conventions
are discussed briefly below:

a. **First** **Geneva**
**Convention.**
This Convention provides for
the protection of
wounded and sick
combatants in the
field, irrespective of their nationality. Wounded and
sick combatants who fall into enemy hands are recognised as prisoners of war.
b. **Second Geneva Convention.** This Convention
closely follows the provisions of the first Geneva
Convention in structure and content, but contains
provisions specifically applicable to war at sea (eg
hospital ships). This Convention is an extension of
the First Geneva Convention (wounded and sick on
land), the terms of which apply to maritime warfare.
In addition to the protection of the wounded and
sick, this Convention protects combatants and other
personnel who are at sea and who are shipwrecked.
c. **Third Geneva Convention. This Convention**
protects persons entitled to prisoner of war status.
The Third Geneva Convention provides that prisoners of war must at all times be humanely treated, and
precisely defines, inter alia, requirements for conditions and places of captivity, particularly with regard
to the labour of prisoners of war, their financial resources, the relief they receive, and judicial proceedings instituted against them. It furthermore provides
that any unlawful act or omission by the detaining


-----

power causing death or seriously endangering the
health of a prisoner of war in its custody is prohibited and will be regarded as a grave breach of
the Convention. Prisoners of war are entitled in all
circumstances to respect for their person and their
honour.
d. **Fourth Geneva Convention. This Convention**
protects civilians during wartime. Treaties which had
been adopted before 1949 were concerned with
combatants only, and did not address the protection of civilians. The large-scale collateral damage
amongst civilians during World War II demonstrated
the disastrous consequences of the absence of a
convention for their protection in wartime. As such,
this Convention was added to the existing three
Geneva Conventions in 1949.
e. **Protocols I and II to the Geneva Conventions.**
i. **Protocol I extends the applicability of the**
Geneva Conventions during international
armed conflict.
ii. **Protocol II extends the applicability of the**
Geneva Conventions to internal conflict occurring within the borders of a state between
government armed forces and armed dissidents, or between two or more armed dissident groups where the dissidents are under
responsible command, and exercise such
control over parts of the territory to enable
them to carry out sustained and concerted
military operations and to implement the
Protocol.

15. Other agreements prohibit the use of certain weapons
and military tactics and protect certain categories of people and
goods. These agreements include: the 1954 Convention for the
Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict,
plus its two protocols; the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention; the 1980 Certain Conventional Weapons Convention and
its five protocols; the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention; the
1997 Mines Ban Treaty on anti-personnel mines; and the 2000
Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child
on the involvement of children in armed conflict.

16. Defence will be bound by IHL and all other conventions
and treaties pertaining to armed conflict and to which South
Africa is a party.

17. Defence will continue to support the fulfilment of South
Africa’s IHL obligations. Acknowledging that within the constraints of IHL, the choice of weapons and the methods of warfare are not unlimited, Defence will consequently:

5 Obligation arising from Article 55 of the first Additional Protocol.


a. Ensure defence compliance with IHL obligations.
b. Demonstrate particular diligence in furthering the
objectives of IHL which define the conduct and responsibilities of belligerent nations, neutral nations
and individuals engaged in warfare.
c. Have due regard for the civilian population, noncombatants, neutral parties, protected persons and
emblems.
d. Ensure that collateral damage deemed excessive in
relation to the military advantage gained from operations is prevented.
e. Not use restricted weapons outside of agreed
parameters.
f. Not employ weapons that are prohibited.
g. Offer protection for certain persons (those not participating in hostilities) and property.
h. Protect all cultural property and the environment[5]
during armed conflict.
i. Be compliant with reporting obligations arising in
terms of binding instruments.
j. Pursue a specific relationship with, amongst others,
the International Committee of the Red Cross to
assist where required in the integration of IHL in
defence programmes.

###### Scale of Defence Effort

18.  The Defence response to IHL obligations will be to:
a. Focus on interventions across all levels of command
and staff functions.
b. Reflect IHL obligations at all levels of defence doctrine so as to avoid overt contradiction between defence doctrine and international treaty obligations.
c. Reflect IHL in military training curricula, commencing with basic military training and elaborating such
training per category of ranks.
d. Reflecting IHL obligations in all defence training
manuals.
e. Ensuring an effective sanction mechanism to explicitly cover IHL breaches and violations.

###### NATIONAL ARMS CONTROL OBLIGATIONS

19. As a responsible arms trading nation, South Africa has instituted rigorous legislation and regulations regarding conventional
arms transfer, including export of conventional arms, under the
auspices of the National Conventional Arms Control Committee (NCACC) which is competent to regulate the transfer of
conventional arms.


-----

20. Defence must adhere to arms control regulations within
its own field of endeavour and assist with conducting review,
compliance and verification services, when so required by the
NCACC.

21. Defence has a further responsibility to be represented on
the Non-Proliferation Council (NPC) housed at the Department
of Trade and Industry, and to assist the NPC in its tasks related to
the prevention of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and related dual-use items.


##### TASK 12

 ASSIST CIVIL AUTHORITY AS OR- DERED


ident, VIPs and other identified persons:
a. Command and control arrangements.
b. Close protection.
c. Air transport and associated medical and security
support for domestic, continental and inter-continental travel.
d. Search and rescue and combat search and rescue
missions.
e. Rapid reaction support.


##### TASK 11

 ORDERED PRESIDENTIAL TASKS


###### PRESIDENTIAL TASKS

22. Defence provides specific support related to the execution
of presidential duties. The support is primarily in the areas of
air transport, close protection and medical services and extends
to the President, the Deputy President, the Minister of Defence
and other identified persons. (Figure 8-4). This support will be a
standing commitment.

23. The President, as Commander-in-Chief and as the Head
of the National Executive, may from time to time order the Defence Force into service for other identified tasks.

24. Under a standing Presidential employment authority, the
Defence Force will provide the following for support to the Pres
_Figure 8-4: Task 11 - Ordered Presidential Tasks_


###### DEFENCE EFFECT

25. In times of crisis or great need South Africa and its people
are secured through the Defence Force’s assistance to civil authority in the maintenance of essential services, the protection of
life, health and property and the execution of any other services
that may be ordered by Government (Figure 8-5).

###### DOMESTIC SUPPORT TO CIVIL AUTHOR- ITY IN TIMES OF NEED

26. Defence may be called upon to assist civil authority with
a range of tasks when capacity has become strained, when a
situation or an emergency is beyond the latter’s capabilities or
in the event of an imminent crisis. Typical tasks may include:
consequence management and relief after man-made and natu
ral disasters, support to special events, the
protection of life and property, and the augmentation of vital services in times of need.
Defence may thus render assistance with
the prevention of the spread of diseases
affecting humans and livestock, the transportation and distribution of food or water
during droughts, fighting major fires, search
and rescue operations during floods and relief operations after earthquakes or floods,
to name but a few examples. Humanitarian assistance operations may be necessary
when people are suffering severe threat or
deprivation and normal civil assistance is
hampered or prevented.

27. Task-organised elements may be detached to other departments as required.
This may include mobile forces to quickly
deal with the particular situation, using centralised air-mobile forces or decentralised


-----

_Figure 8-5: Task 12 - Assist Civil Authority as Ordered by Government_

forces moving by road. Defence will have a permanent pool of
equipment (cargo carriers, tents, water bunkers and strategic
medicines) available on standby to support the three levels of
government. The organisation thereof will be determined in the
force design.

28. Currently, other government departments will act as the
lead department, with Defence in support of their activities. In
many cases, Defence provides the ‘backbone’ command and
control capability for the management of disasters and emergencies. A policy discourse and a consequent Cabinet decision
on the Defence role in disaster management are expected in
the near future, with a possible concomitant statutory amendment should it be so necessary.

###### HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE AND DISASTER RELIEF IN THE REGION

29. Humanitarian assistance and disaster relief interventions
may take place throughout and beyond the African continent.
Operations will preferably be launched through regional, continental and international security structures, although specific
operational requirements and the degree, extent and urgency
of the humanitarian crisis may necessitate independent action.

30. Humanitarian assistance operations cover a wide range of
actions which may include the deployment of troops to prevent
the spread of diseases affecting humans and livestock, the transportation and distribution of food or water during droughts,


fighting major bush fires, search and rescue
operations during floods and relief operations after earthquakes or floods, to name
but a few. Humanitarian assistance operations may be necessary when people are
facing a severe threat or deprivation and civilian assistance is hampered or prevented.
These operations combine the demands of
humanitarian assistance operations with stability operations to protect the population,
relief teams and their stores, and to ensure
free movement and the free distribution of
supplies.

31. Defence, as authorised by Government, will use its collateral capabilities to
provide rapidly deployable forces to stabilise
such situations prior to the deployment of
follow-on forces and the humanitarian agencies required to enable and execute relief
operations.

###### ANTI-POACHING MEASURES

32. The collateral capability of the Defence Force will be utilised to support civil authority in combating the illegal poaching
of South Africa’s flora and fauna, with specific attention being
given to the protection of the rhinoceros and abalone populations in the short-term. This may be extended to other flora
or fauna that may require protection in times to come. Specific short-term operations will be conducted on the basis of a
Memorandum of Agreement between the Minister of Defence
and the relevant Executive Authority. This support will have
the three-fold objective of disrupting, preventing and deterring
poaching.

###### OTHER ORDERED DEFENCE OPERATIONS

33. Defence will execute any other services that may from
time to time be ordered by Government within the parameters
of domestic and international law.


###### DEFENCE EFFECT

34. Development is enhanced by the collaborative and incremental defence contribution to the developmental agenda.


##### TASK 13

be tasked to enhance critical infrastructure in rural
and inaccessible areas. These actions will allow for
the sourcing of labour from remote communities
and will assist in skills development and upliftment in
such communities.


_“Patriotism is not the exclusive domain of the military,_
_but the Defence Force remains and provides a perfect_
_template and platform from which to begin to address_
_patriotism in South Africa.”_

**Submission by Tebogo Kebotlhale - MKMVA**
**Chairperson: North West**


b. **Spatial Dispersion of Defence Infrastruc-**
**ture. Military bases in outlying areas provide em-**
ployment and improve the economic profile of rural
communities. Defence will seek to enhance its rural
dispersion and will promote employment from the
local communities. Defence Force bases in rural areas will also prioritise procurement from local business and industry.
c. **Reserve Utilisation. The utilisation of Reserves**
from rural communities augments the income
streams of poorer households. Reserves with specialised skills and experience can also be utilised to
assist in development projects. The expansion of
the Reserve system in rural areas will consequently
be prioritised.
d. **Employment. Defence is committed to the con-**
tinuous 100% filling of all funded vacant posts and
an increased utilisation of its Reserves. Entry level
recruitment to the Defence Force will be done
through advertisements in the local and national
media, and contact sessions at schools and tertiary
education institutions, followed by country-wide selection boards.
e. **Community Services. The Defence Force can**
be tasked to render specific community services in
areas where other authorities are unable to render
the required support. Defence Force facilities may
be utilised for the education, training and development of local communities. Such initiatives will be
executed in collaboration with the relevant authorities and stakeholders.
f. **Critical Infrastructure Interventions. As a**
principle defence will not generally compete with
the private sector in the provision of infrastructure.
However, the collateral capability of defence may


###### Inherent Potential

41. The inherent potential of the Defence Force to support
national development can be realised almost automatically as
a direct result of its normal peacetime activities, although some
minor steering can enhance this effect without detriment to its
primary functions and with appropriate additional resources and
time to establish capabilities to this effect.

42. The Defence Force’s potential in this respect can be realised without detriment to its primary functions, and with appropriate additional resources and time to establish necessary
capabilities.

43. **The Social Role – Developing the Person. Military**
service, even quite brief periods, can play an important and
valuable role in:
a. Maturing and socialising young adults;
b. Providing a stable environment in which to enhance
the education of young people from disadvantaged
backgrounds;
c. Developing in young people from different communities and social sectors a national consciousness and
cohesion; and
d. Enhancing and deepening the integration of minority
groups in the wider community.

44. **The Socio-Economic Role – Supporting Local**
**Communities. There is considerable potential for the De-**
fence Force to support socio-economic development in, par

-----

ticularly, rural communities and towns. This arises from the fact
that any military unit:
a. Will inject resources into the surrounding community, through:
i. Its personnel spending their salaries locally;
ii. Local purchases (eg food, fuel, cleaning materials, stationery);
iii. Procuring certain services locally (eg glazier,
plumber);
iv. Hiring locally to fill certain civilian posts within
the unit; and
v. Recruiting from among the local population.
b. Can provide assistance from certain units in emergencies – medical, fire-fighting, support to police,
repair of critical machinery (eg emergency vehicles,
generators, pumps).
c. Can enhance or provide certain community health
services.

45. **Economic Role. The Defence Force has an inherent abil-**
ity to support economic activity within the country, arising from
its need:
a. To procure normal consumables, both locally and at
the national level (for its reserve stocks), which can
be procured from the business community;
b. For uniforms and general field equipment, which can
be manufactured by the business community;
c. To purchase some commercial-standard equipment
and vehicles that can be supplied and supported by
the business community;
d. To procure certain commercially available services
(construction, civil engineering) that can be cost-effectively contracted to the business community; and
e. To acquire locally produced and integrated defence
systems and high-end technology.

46. **Industrial Role. Finally the Defence Force has an inher-**
ent ability to support development of the industrial sector, arising
from its requirement for:
a. The maintenance, repair, overhaul, modernisation
and upgrading of military equipment, which will not
always justify in-house capability, thus creating commercial opportunity;
b. The manufacture of equipment required on a scale
that justifies local manufacture, as well as the manufacture of munitions and spares; and
c. The development of optimised equipment.

47. **Science, Engineering and Technology. The Defence**
Force’s requirements can also stimulate the national science,
engineering and technology base in a range of technical fields,
which will:


a. Spin-off into other sectors of industry, thereby
broadening the country’s industrial base; and
b. Attract young people to engineering, science and
technology, thereby expanding and deepening the
country’s technical skills base.

###### Potential for Directed Development Support

48. In addition to its inherent potential, and given appropriate additional funding and time to ramp-up and improve specific
capabilities, the Defence Force also has the potential to, without
detriment to its primary function, carry out a range of directed
activities in support of national development. It can also support
the civil authorities and police in dealing with natural and manmade disasters.

49. **Service Systems. Short-term and medium-term service**
systems can be structured to include further education or training that prepares the member for a career outside the military.
This approach can assist young people from disadvantaged backgrounds to obtain an education or training they could otherwise
not obtain, while providing the Defence Force with its junior
personnel for a period of service that may be prescribed by the
Defence Force. Support could incorporate:
a. Bursaries for degrees or training to be followed by a
period of contracted service during which the member will gain experience in a field where the Defence
Force has a particular need;
b. post-service bursaries for university or technical
courses;
c. in-service training additionally focused on preparing
members for a later civilian career in a related field;
and
d.  p re-discharge vocational training.

50. Such education and training programmes can range from
flight training through to medical and engineering education and
training to artisan training in most fields.

51. **Defence Force Skills. The Defence Force has a wide**
range of skills that can be applied to national development projects. Again, given appropriate additional funding and time to
ramp-up and improve specific capabilities, the Defence Force
also has the potential to be deployed for specific tasks, while
improving skills for the benefit of the Defence Force itself. For
instance:
a. Medical teams can be deployed to rural areas when
capacity is available;
b. technical teams can be deployed to maintain or repair equipment (generators, pumps) and vehicles in
outlying areas; and
c. instructors can be deployed to provide adult educa

-----

tion or basic technical training for people in outlying
areas.

52. Defence Force Capabilities and Equipment. As before, given appropriate additional funding and time to ramp-up
and improve specific capabilities, the Defence Force also has a
range of capabilities and equipment that can be employed in
support of national development. For instance:
a. Army engineers can maintain (even construct) roads
and bridges in inaccessible areas or in insecure areas, where it is not commercially viable to do so;
b. Air Force transport aircraft and helicopters can
move equipment to areas that are not accessible to
commercial aircraft or where commercial air transport is not viable; and
c. Air Force reconnaissance aircraft can carry out mapping work for projects in outlying areas, especially in
cases where this would not be commercially viable.

###### BROAD CONCEPTS

53. The Defence Force will use its inherent capacity, collateral
capabilities, networks and links to society as well as its business
programmes to support Government’s developmental agenda.
The contribution to national development may, however, result
in indirect contingent commitments where defence capabilities
are provided to other departments against compensation, and
by exception, in direct commitments requiring structuring and
budgeting provision within Defence.

###### Supporting Youth Development

a. **Military Training. Professionally conducted mili-**
tary training is extremely valuable in maturing and
socialising young adults, developing in them selfconfidence and self-respect and the capacity for
mutual respect.  A significant Reserve component,
whose members are normally occupied with their
civilian activities when not on active military duty,
can set a good citizenship example, contribute to
community leadership and be an inspiration for the
youth within the communities in which they live.
b. **National Youth Service. Defence will continue**

departments and against compensation. Funding for
the programme will be provided by the requesting
government department by way of transfer payment to the programme before commencement of
the training. Graduates of the National Youth Development Programme may be considered, against
stringent criteria, for recruitment into the military for
basic military training.
i. The NYS will be established as an auxiliary[6]
service of the Department of Defence[7]. The
Minister will determine in Regulations, the annual NYS intake and the term of such service[8].
ii. The DOD will provide such NYS service in
cooperation with other government departments and role-players. The contribution of
the Defence Force and other government
departments and role-players will be planned
and budgeted for.
iii. The NYS will comprise induction, formative
training, community service training, workintegrated or service learning, as well as continuation training, including accredited hard[9]
and soft skills[10], social and business entrepreneurship training and community service delivery. All training will be formally accredited
and assessed.
c. **Voluntary Youth Programmes. Services will**
continue to provide Voluntary Youth Programmes
(such as Young Lions, Siyandiza, Young Falcons and
Naval Cadets). Within such programmes, youth adventure camps will engender discipline and mould
future leaders. Graduates of these programmes
may be considered, against stringent criteria, for recruitment into the Defence Force for basic military
training. This will enhance social cohesion and serve
to “grow own wood”. Such Voluntary Youth Programmes should:
i. Promote the values, norms and standards of
the Constitution.
ii. Promote norms and standards.
iii. Enhance societal responsibility and engender
ethics and discipline.
iv Promote the importance of education and its
centrality in society.
v. Endeavour to include stakeholders (not limited to the following):


-----

(1) Department of Education.
(2) Provincial governments.
(3) Institutions of traditional authority.

###### Supporting Community Development

54. Defence Civilians. Recruit and employ defence civilians
from local communities.

55. **Regulars. Recruit and appoint Regulars from rural**
communities.

56. **Reserves. The utilisation of Reserves in military opera-**
tions, administrative tasks and command and management positions and other duties will continue to be a main consideration
when considering the personnel requirements of the Defence
Force.
a. Recruit and appoint Reserves from rural communities preferably in close proximity to the units that
they will be assigned to.
b. Maximising the utilisation of Reserves that live in rural
areas will provide economic benefit to rural communities and enhance the development of rural
economies.
c. Specialist Reserves should be deployed to struggling
government institutions to maintain the infrastructure and carry over their knowledge and experience
to employees of these institutions.

57. **Essential Critical Infrastructure. Deliberate actions**
to enhance critical infrastructure in rural and inaccessible areas
can be executed against compensation from the relevant government department requiring the intervention. These actions
may include the building or emergency repair of bridges, roads,
clinics, etc. These initiatives can be approached as force preparation exercises if necessary.

###### Supporting Economic Development

58. New Technologies. The Defence Force remains an
agent that initiates, facilitates or triggers the establishment of
new capabilities and technologies in the country. The Defence
Force provides the catalyst for technology development and its
concomitant economic activities. These range from the basic requirement to maintain existing equipment and facilities, to the


higher-order requirements of developing new technologies that
enhance the efficacy of defence capabilities.

59. Spatial Dispersion of Defence Facilities. Defence
will optimise the spatial dispersion of its units and facilities to
the requirements of the defence goals and tasks. Priority will be
given to the establishment of military units away from the main
economic hubs of South Africa. This dispersion will enhance
economic activities in these areas and provide a catalyst for further development.

60. **Defence Procurement. The procurement function will**
be decentralised to unit level with appropriate delegations. Units
will be expected to procure goods and services from local communities as far as possible. Units will create a community liaison
capability to coordinate the requirements with local goods and
service providers. Specific attention will be given to providing
coordinated off-take agreements with emerging farmers and service providers.

###### Supporting Sport and Recreation

61 The Defence Force may engage communities in developmental initiatives such as the promotion of youth development
through leadership programmes centred on sports, physical
education, adventure and recreation.

62. In collaboration with national sports bodies, the collateral
utility of the Defence Force can be used to establish sport and
recreation-based youth cadets in communities adjacent to defence force bases for youth between the ages of 14 and 17.
Military sporting bodies and clubs may thus engage at community level for the purpose of increasing exposure of the youth to
sporting activities and opportunities. An example hereof is the
_Izivunguvungu sailing programme._

63. As part of the professionalisation of the physical training,
sport and recreation function, the Defence Force may give consideration to the establishment of a high-performance sports capability. Such a centre may serve to:
a. Enhance the capacity of the Defence Force to engage communities in developmental initiatives such
as the promotion of youth development through
leadership programmes centred on sports, physical
education, adventure and recreation.


-----

b. Form part of a retention and development strategy for athletes from disadvantaged backgrounds
who have the potential to develop into Olympiclevel athletes. Collaboration between the Defence
Force and Sport and Recreation South Africa (SRSA)
and the South African Sports Confederation and
Olympic Committee (SASCOC) would have to be
secured.
c. Make use of the services of qualified sport officers


and physical training instructors when presenting
youth and cadet camps.

64. The contribution to national development will result in indirect contingent commitments where defence capabilities are
provided to other departments against compensation, and direct defence commitments requiring structuring and budgeting
provision within Defence. Defence will not necessarily structure for its contribution to the Developmental Agenda but will
use its inherent collateral utility.

## THE DEFENCE STRATEGIC      TRAJECTORY


##### SOUTH AFRICAN DEFENCE SPENDING


###### BUDGET TRENDS

1. South Africa’s defence spending has fluctuated considerably over the past century. After the spikes of the First World
War and the Second World War, when spending reached a high
of more than 17% of GDP, spending declined sharply to around
1% of GDP until the 1970s, when it increased to between 2%
and 3% of GDP, rising sharply to almost 5% in the late-1970s
(Figure 9-1). The defence budget grew almost tenfold in nominal terms between 1975 and 1989, from R1 billion (bn) to R9.4
bn. In constant dollar value, however, the increase was modest,
growing from US$3 bn per year in the early 1980s to US$3.43
bn per year in the last half of that decade, based on 1988 prices.

1 www.globalsecurity.org.

2 United States Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, 1989.

3 www.globalsecurity.org.


Defence spending averaged 16.4% of government spending in
the 1980s; it ranged from a high of 22.7% in 1982 to a low of
13.7% in 1987, but rose again to 15.7% of government spending in 1989[1].

2. In 1989, South Africa ranked 13[th] in total world-wide military expenditure, 44[th] in world military spending as a percentage
of gross national product and 63[rd] in world military spending as
a percentage of total government spending. South Africa also
ranked 49[th] in the size of its armed forces, but only 103[rd] in
terms of the size of armed forces in relation to population[2].

3. By the mid-1990s, South African defence spending had
been reduced to less than 3% of gross domestic product and
less than 10% of total government spending. Military salaries
by that time consumed more than half of defence spending.
Spending on armaments and equipment declined from 44% of
defence spending in the 1980s to 28% in 1994[3].


-----

4. Between 1995
and the approval of
the Defence Review
in 1998, the defence
budget was cut by
11.1% (R1,4 bn[5]) in
nominal terms, with
the concurrent mismatch arising between
policy intent and execution. The defence
budget further decreased from 1.54%
of GDP in 2004/05
and has levelled out in
recent years at around
1.2% to 1.1% of GDP.
The 1998 Defence
Review force design _Figure 9-1: Defence Budget as a Percentage of GDP[4]_
was consequently neither affordable nor

sustainable, especially following the defence budget cuts in the **IMPACT ON DEFENCE CAPABILITIES**
late 1990s. South Africa at present spends less than 1.2% of
GDP on defence (Figure 9-2), translating to less than five cents 5. While South Africa is not perceived to be a global military

_Figure 9-3: Relative Force-levels over Time_

mitments are thus currently at a level far beyond the policy predictions of the late 1990s.

6. In addition, the decrease in the defence allocation reflects
directly in the level of prime equipment the Defence Force can
acquire and operate. Figure 9-3 indicates the relative force levels over a fifty-year period from 1961 to 2011. The line-graph
uses a logarithmic scale on the vertical axis in order to be able to
reflect the number of combat vehicles, aircraft and naval vessels
on one chart. The horizontal axis shows defence expenditure
as a percentage of GDP, with the year-on-year percentage being
reflected in the bar-graph. The graphs show that:
a. In 1961, the Defence Force had around 680 combat vehicles, peaking at around 6 470 vehicles at the
end of the 1990s and beginning to plateau around
1 680 vehicles in 2011.
b. In 1961, the Defence Force had around 91 combat
aircraft in service, peaking at around 335 in the mid1980s and 48 in 2006. This has risen to 65 with the
introduction of the SAAB Gripen light fighter.
c. In 1961, the Defence Force had 23 warships (frigates, destroyers and submarines) and this has decreased to 11 warships in 2011.

7. The integration of the Strategic Defence Packages has
proven to be far more costly than was originally planned. The
introduction of recently acquired modern defence equipment
has resulted in an unpredicted increase in their operating cost.


In most instances:
a. In order to reduce initial cost, lifecycle logistic support was not fully provided for during acquisition
and it was envisaged that this would be covered in
the operating budget of the combat services.
b. The current operating budget has proven insufficient to cover higher than planned fuel costs, inservice training, maintenance, repair and support to
modern defence systems.
c. The introduction of new defence systems required
that they were extensively operated to prove doctrine, resulting in unanticipated costs.
d. The on-going support needed to optimise these
new defence systems, develop doctrine, tactics and
battle-handling and ensure interoperability with other higher-order defence capabilities is placing excessive demand on the defence science, engineering
and technology system. The current defence research and development budget had never planned
to support these through lifecycle activities and argues for a separate in-service science, engineering
and technology system and budget.

8. Defence prime mission equipment is thus unsustainable
within the current budget allocation and standards of proficiency
are ever decreasing, due partly to both limited funds for force
preparation and the poor serviceability of certain major prime
mission equipment.


-----

9. The major defence programmes (landward defence, air
defence, maritime defence, military health support and command and control systems) therefore have definable risks and
shortcomings, exacerbated by the escalation in fuel and medical
prices, increased maintenance costs and the high tempo of operations which have to be supported along extended logistic lines.

10. The South African military is consequently too poorly
equipped and funded to execute the widening spectrum of tasks
to the desired level[9]. The increase in defence commitments
from 1999 onwards, the introduction of new weapon systems
and the lack of any significant adjustment to the defence allocation have rendered the Defence Force unsustainable and only
partially compliant with the constitutional imperative to defend
and protect South Africa and its people. It is severely stretched
and many of its core military capacities require an intervention to
make them sustainable.

11. Internationally it is well understood that systems need to
be managed over the intended life of that system. Generally
it is accepted that the acquisition costs of a military system will
reflect approximately 10-20% of the total lifecycle costs of that
system. It therefore stands to reason that between 80-90% of
the lifecycle costs will have to be provided over the life of that
particular system (Figure 9-4). In essence this means that for a
system with a 30-year lifespan, 2.67% of the total lifecycle costs

_Figure 9-4: Life Cycle Costs of Defence Systems_

9 Kruger, A., Peace Mission Programme ISS, 07 April 2010.


will have to be made available every year, for 30 years. By example, it means that for a vessel with an acquisition cost (20%)
of R2,5 bn, the lifecycle costs (80%) will approximate R10 bn.
Annually, over a period of 30 years, the system owner will have
to ensure that it allocates R333 mil to that system for lifecycle
management (constant Rand value). This reality must influence
the acquisition of new systems.

###### IMPACT ON READINESS

12. The Minister, the Military Command and the Defence Secretariat have consequently raised their concerns on the persistent defence underfunding and have consistently articulated the
consequences, as set out below. The Services are integrated
systems that can be defined as “an organised, purposeful struc

_“These are perhaps the most significant statements in_
_the document, and the most serious. If the authori-_
_ties are not shaken by these, they do not have a good_
_understanding of what national priorities should be. These_
_very explicit warning signs should convince every sensible_
_leader/politician of the need for an increase in the De-_

ture regarded as a
whole and consisting of interrelated
and interdependent
elements (components, entities, factors, members, parts,
etc). These elements
continually influence
one another (directly
or indirectly) to maintain their activity and
the existence of the
system, in order to
achieve the goal of
the system”. The Defence Force is a ‘system of systems’ and
as such the various
components are integrally reliant on one
another.


-----

**SA ARMY**

13. The SA Army faces block obsolescence of its prime mission equipment and much of its support capabilities. This is
directly attributable to the SA Army not having benefitted from
a Strategic Defence Package capital renewal programme as did
the SA Air Force and the SA Navy.

14. The lack of an adequate operating budget has further resulted in the serviceability of equipment remaining in service to
steadily decline as major repair and maintenance programmes
have been pushed back in order to reallocate the majority of its
operating budget to personnel-related expenditures.

15. As a result of the above constraints the SA Army is no longer in a position to conduct major combat operations, nor fully
roll out the forces needed to safeguard South Africa’s borders
within the required timeframes.

16. The SA Army is further finding it increasingly difficult to
sustain the deployment of its soldiers in the various peace missions across the continent.

**SA AIR FORCE**

17. The SA Air Force remains critically underfunded. This
has a direct impact upon its ability to maintain combat readiness
across the full spectrum of operational tasks expected of it.

18. The air combat and air combat support capability is severely constrained due to an inadequate flying-hours budget.
This has resulted in insufficient pilots being trained to fly the
newly acquired fighter aircraft and combat support helicopters;
those that have been trained are not being afforded the opportunity to fly the requisite hours for maintaining combat proficiency. From a combat readiness perspective these capabilities, therefore, remain largely grounded. Such aircraft as can be
mounted for an operation will also be restricted in their combat
radius due to the loss of the in-flight refuelling capability.

19. The medium and light fixed-wing transport aircraft are all
reaching the end of their operational life. Increased upgrade, repair and maintenance cycles have resulted in a reduction of their
operational availability. Currently the fleet is unable to meet the
lift requirements for supporting the external operations and any
surge in this requirement will result in an even greater reliance
on contracted airlift services. The current medium rotary wing
transport capability falls far short of the operational requirement.

20. The absence of airborne early air-warning sensors has
resulted in a situation where only limited aerial domain aware

ness exists over large parts of South Africa’s airspace today. The
conduct of intelligence-driven operations aimed at safeguarding
South Africa’s territorial integrity and protecting its borderlines is
thus severely restricted.

**SA NAVY**

21. The SA Navy experiences severe pressure on its operating budget. This has primarily been brought about by increased
sustainment costs resulting from the increased operational tempo of its frigates as well as the need to keep the obsolete offshore patrol vessels operating until their eventual replacement.
The situation is further exacerbated by increased personnel
spending, necessitating the reallocation of critical maintenance
and repair funds. This has resulted in a situation where the SA
Navy’s vessels can no longer be made combat-ready to execute
the full range of missions they were designed for. In particular
it is the primary war-fighting capabilities that have been severely
affected.

22. The absence of dedicated static and airborne maritime
sensors has resulted in a situation where virtually no maritime
domain awareness exists around South Africa’s coasts today. The
conduct of intelligence-driven operations aimed at safeguarding
South Africa’s territorial integrity and protecting resources in its
Exclusive Economic Zone is thus severely restricted.

**SA MILITARY HEALTH SERVICE**

23. The rising cost of medical care in South Africa is mirrored
in the SA Military Health Service. The cost of medicine, medical
equipment and contractual obligations places enormous strain
on the military health budget, exacerbated by increased personnel spending. The military health budget now faces evergrowing pressure due to the provision of free medical care to
dependants and military veterans. The quality of medical care
delivered to serving members of the Defence Force is consequently less than acceptable.

24. Shortfalls in professional medical expertise severely limit
operational medical support. Medical support can currently
only be sustained at less than a conventional brigade through
the deployment of a medical battalion group minus. Similarly,
chemical and biological defence capabilities have become aged
and obsolete and the professional medical institutes are struggling to provide specialised medical and research services.

25. Level 4[10] and 3 hospitals providing support to the Defence
Force are being upgraded through a repair and maintenance
programme (RAMP) intervention which will partially address
these facilities. However, these hospitals must be recapitalised,


10 1 Mililtary Hospital is one of the contracted Level 4 (Out of Mission) UN Hospitals in Africa.


-----

new Military Base Hospitals built, pharmaceutical stocks replenished and a specialised Medical Base Depot established to store
pharmaceuticals, including those required for national reserve
stock.

###### STRATEGIC STOCK RESERVES

26. The required ammunition stock level for the national reserve is currently unspecified, but it is believed that to comply
with the constitutional imperative, an Army Mechanised Brigade
must be supported for ninety days in a mixture of high, medium
and low intensity operations, with requisite combat support and
combat service support being rendered by combat services and
staff divisions.

27. Current ammunition levels can by no means support this
level of effort. The Defence Force’s ammunition stocks have
been depleted over time in certain crucial areas. In some instances ammunition must be procured for training, deployments
and national reserve replenishment. The Defence Force needs
to urgently invest in new ammunition as well as the scheduled
disposal of aged ammunition in order to allow for the following:
a. Building up of ammunition reserves.
b. Training and formally exercising forces.
c. Replacing old and unstable ammunition.
d. Providing controlled throughput of ammunition.
e. Sustaining strategic capabilities in the defence industry.

28. Depot spares, equipment and strategic fuel reserves are

generally depleted and equipment in stock requires repair
and/or replacement. Fragmented management information
systems inhibit integrated and
systemic decision making.

###### DEFENCE FACILITIES

29. The condition of defence
facilities is significantly impacting
on readiness and sustainability due to a facility maintenance
backlog. This impact is increasing markedly.

30. The budget of the National Department of Public Works
for maintenance, municipal
rates and services, and leases
has been devolved to the Defence Force, requiring alterna

tive approaches to facility maintenance being investigated, including the establishment of a Defence Works Formation. Defence
must budget in future for its total facility cost.

31. Key force preparation facilities and weapons ranges are
under threat.
a. Operational infrastructure (runways, taxiways, approach lights, approach aids, control towers, firefighting services, fuel and ammunition depots, etc)
requires interventions to remain functional.
b. Facilities and infra-structure in general require major
upgrades, renovation and maintenance.
c. Training infrastructure (simulators, classrooms, etc) is
in need of maintenance, repair, replacement and/or
upgrading.
d. Support contracting for 2[nd], 3[rd] and 4[th] line maintenance is severely constrained.

32. There is severe pressure to release defence land for alternate uses. Several strategic Defence Force depots and training
and testing ranges are already threatened by encroachment, reducing their effectiveness and posing potential risk to the safety
of encroaching communities.

###### THE IMPACT ON PERSONNEL, OPERATING AND CAPITAL

33. The allocation of the current defence budget is also a matter of concern. In FY 2010/11 the compensation of employees
rose to 55% of the allocation, despite these employees “being,


_Figure 9-5: Personnel, Operating and Capital Expenditure in Recent Years_


-----

at entry level, the lowest paid of South Africa’s public servants[11].
This leaves little for training and exercises or for operations such
as peacekeeping or the maintenance of public order[12]”.

34. The 1998 Defence Review pegged the defence personnel budget at 40% of the total budget with 30% to be spent on
operating costs and the remaining 30% to be spent on capital
costs (40:30:30 ratio). As can be seen in Figures 9-5 and Figure 9-6, the 40% benchmark was maintained until FY 2009/10,
where after personnel spending, as a percentage of the defence
budget, climbed substantially beyond the envisaged 40% of allocation to 55%.

35. This upward trend can be attributed to six main causes:
a. The increased level of tasks, such as regional peacekeeping and border safeguarding commitments, has
brought about a higher personnel requirement.
b. The general phenomenon of growing labour costs
in South Africa.
c. Government’s employment imperative required all
vacant posts in the public service to be filled, creating upward pressure on the defence personnel
budget.
d. Defence retains people who no longer fit their postprofile or who cannot be economically employed.
e. Recent service improvements for defence personnel were introduced without commensurate budget
augmentation from the National Treasury.
f. The defence budget was augmented each year ac

cordingly for the Strategic Defence Packages. The
tapering off of these additional capital funds means
that in recent years the ratio of personnel, operating
and capital has distorted the defence budget.

36. The expanding defence personnel budget impacts negatively on the defence operating budget, resulting in an underinvestment in the levels of maintenance and repair, training and
force preparation required to meet South Africa’s defence commitments. However, this apparently inflated personnel budget is
not necessarily an indication of inflated staffing, but of an insufficient operating and capital budget to support the activities of
the Defence Force.

37. Similarly, capital spending has declined to close on 10%
of the allocation, impacting negatively on the consequential renewal of prime mission equipment, constant reprioritising of the
capital budget, and delayed decision-making on defence acquisitions.

38. The acquisition of new armament has been sub-optimal
due to a number of interrelated factors impacting upon the process.

39. In the first place the absence of an appropriate Force
Design giving rise to a fully funded long-term joint capital plan has
resulted in a fragmented approach to acquiring new armaments
where Services and Divisions largely act in silos and base their
current armaments planning on their current financial allocations

as reflected in the Strategic Capital
Acquisition Master Plan (SCAMP)
within the MTEF timeframe. This
‘silo’ approach has resulted in suboptimal acquisition solutions being
sought that have not fully supported the tenets of jointness and the
enhanced defence effect that could
have been achieved. It has further
resulted in acquisition priorities being shifted frequently and in critical
needs being only partially satisfied.


40. In the **second place the**
acquisition process itself is very
slow due to the cumbersome regulatory checks and balances that
have been built into it. This results in, inter alia, equipment only
becoming available long after the
_Figure 9-6: Personnel, Operating and Capital as Portions of the Defence Budget_
requirement was registered, by

11 The African.org, http://www.the-african.org/blog/?p=192.

12 Kruger, A., Peace Mission Programme ISS, 07 April 2010.


-----

which time the requirement has invariably changed, giving rise
to a new requirement or a modification(s) to the requirement
being initiated. Exacerbating this situation is requirement creep
during the acquisition process, which results in both time and
cost overruns.

41. In the third place, given the complexity of the process,
the capacity to support the process is often lacking. This has
been evident within the Defence Force, Armscor and even within industry. There is thus a need to both streamline the process
and to capacitate it fully with personnel specifically competent in
capital acquisition.

42. Figure 9-7 below demonstrates the decline in uniformed
defence personnel (Regulars and Reserves) consequential to the
decline in the defence allocation. The left hand Y-axis indicates
the numbers of actual personnel and the right hand Y-axis indicates defence expenditure as a percentage of GDP. The bar
graph indicates the actual defence allocation per year as a percentage of GDP.

43. Figure 9-7 clearly demonstrates the rapid decline of the
Reserve component between 1991 and 1996, the years following the end of military conscription. This trend has slowed in
recent years, indicating that stability is being achieved in the Reserve component. Transformation has been slow due to a lack
of investment in the Reserves. The requirement for a relatively
small Regular component backed by a sufficiently large Reserve
component has not been complied with and consequently the

_Figure 9-7: Defence Personnel over time_


strategic imperative of being able to rapidly and cost-effectively
expand through a Reserve component is limited. The effect of
voluntary severance incentives in the late 1980s and post 1996 is
clearly evident in the trends for the Regular component. Nonetheless, the Regular component has remained relatively constant, with some growth in recent years.

44. Notwithstanding this immense decline in the Reserve component, there has, in recent years, been a consistent upward
Reserve utilisation trend in the pursuit of defence obligations.
In particular there has been a significant year-on-year increase
in the number of Reserves called to active duty. This indicates a
healthy core of Reserves which is the basis for the future growth
and rejuvenation of the Reserve component. The Reserve component, being the surge capability to meet ordered commitments, requires significant investment. The current capacity of
the Reserves needs to be enhanced through a concerted effort
to equip and train members of the Reserve component.

45. Defence members with scarce and professional skills are
leaving the Defence Force at concerning rates. It is clear that the
occupation-specific dispensations have some effect in stemming
these losses, but conditions of service continue to contribute to
these losses.

46. The Defence Force is experiencing an alarming loss of
skilled personnel, specifically engineers, technicians, aircrew, vetting officers and legal officers, amongst others, requiring specific
occupational dispensations to prevent the further loss of scarce

skills. The retention
of large numbers of
persons who can no
longer be gainfully
employed further exacerbates this situation.

47. Linked thereto
is a serious shortage
of technical personnel throughout the
Defence Force. This
is due to a mixture
of the inadequacy of
employment incentives and structures,
limited intakes, limited training, reduced
status of technical
personnel, economic
growth (external demand) and industry
practice. Organic for

-----

ward maintenance support (1[st] and 2[nd] line) to the increasingly
modern and complex weapon systems of the Defence Force is
seriously affected, and may lead to dependence on contractor
support in operational areas. There is an urgency to improve
employment incentives for technical personnel, improve technical structures, and increase intakes and training numbers.

**Submission from economist - Prof Geoff Harris**


###### RESTORING THE DEFENCE CAPABILITY

48. The persistent disconnect between the defence mandate,
South Africa’s growing defence commitments and the resource
allocation has eroded defence capabilities to the point where
the Defence Force is unable to fully fulfil its constitutional responsibility to defend and protect South Africa and its people,
and is hard pressed even to maintain its current modest level of
commitments. The current Defence Force baseline is:
a. A personnel complement of approximately 97 000
employees inclusive of Regulars, Reserves and Defence Civilians.
b. Approximately 67 combat units, including Army,
Air Force, Navy, Special Forces and Military Health
units.
c. Funding of about R40 bn in 2013 Rand value, equating to 1.1% of GDP and 3.8% of government expenditure (GE).


49. The Defence Force is in a critical state of decline which is
characterised by: force imbalance; unaffordability of its main operating systems; inability to meet current standing defence commitments; and the lack of critical mobility. Left unchecked, and
at present funding levels, this decline will severely compromise
and further fragment South Africa’s defence capability.

50. South Africa’s defence ambition is driven by its strategic
posture, the role that it wishes to play both regionally and continentally and the consequent level of defence commitments
made.

51. There must be either a greater budget allocation, or a significantly scaled-down level of ambition and commitment which
is aligned to the current budget allocation. In short, there are
two strategic options available for Government: budget must be
determined by policy or budget must drive policy.

52. The reality will most probably lie somewhere in between.
Nonetheless, the fundamental principle remains that the force
design must match the level of commitment, without compromising the necessary ratio between personnel, operations and
capital, and the balance between Regulars and Reserves. A balance of expenditure must be achieved, as currently there is a
severely disjointed and institutionally crippling relationship between spending on personnel, capital and operating.

53. Even with an immediate intervention, it could take at least
five years to arrest the decline and another five years to develop a limited and sustainable defence capability. The longer
the neglect is perpetuated, the greater the effort, time and cost
that would be necessary to arrest the decline and restore the
minimum capabilities required to safeguard South Africa’s borders, protect its maritime trade routes, conduct peace missions
and humanitarian interventions, safeguard South Africa and its
people and defend and protect the country against external aggression.


-----

##### THE REQUIRED DEFENCE CAPABILITY


54. South Africa requires a relevant, balanced and sustainable
defence force to fulfil its constitutional mandate. This constitutional mandate can be distilled into four strategic goals: defend
and protect South Africa; safeguard South Africa; promote regional peace and stability; and contribute to developmental and
other ordered tasks (Figure 9-8).

55. The future force design will pursue a balance of capabilities
that adhere to the strategic concepts of rapid reaction operations
for interventions, expeditionary operations to project forces for
protracted periods, complex war fighting within the human and
physical dimensions of the battle space, interoperability of command and control capabilities, and concurrency of operations in
multiple theatres and joint, inter-agency, interdepartmental and
multinational (JI[2]M) operations.

56. The defence capability must be robust and flexible and
able to project and sustain joint landward, air, maritime, Special
Force and military health operations over extended distances for
protracted periods on the continent. The military operating attributes of: command and control; movement and manoeuvre;
firepower; intelligence; protection and survivability; and sustainment must be embedded in all capabilities (Figure 9-9).

_Figure 9-8: Defence Goals and Tasks_


57. Joint Command and Control.  South Africa requires a
joint command and control capability to ensure joint action with
respect to land, air, sea, information and space, and which must
be capable of integrating with multinational, interdepartmental
and inter-agency components to achieve synergy. Joint command and control must be enabled through a comprehensive
situational awareness capability that provides integrated information acquired through liaison with allied and friendly forces and
governments, local human intelligence, and static and mobile
sensors for enhanced military decision-making. This must be
pursued at the strategic, operational and tactical levels.

58. **Defence Diplomacy. South Africa’s contribution to the**
prevention and resolution of conflict will be enhanced through
an integration of its diplomatic, military and other efforts in a
complementary manner, and in instances supported by appropriate military capabilities that strengthen South Africa’s capacity
to influence international developments. This requires a defence
diplomacy capability, whose strategy and main effort focuses on
those national priorities where defence diplomacy engagements
will add the most value. Defence diplomacy efforts will further
centre on fostering long-standing relationships with key African
states and other strategic partners.

59. **Special Forces. South Africa’s increasingly complex**
and unstable security environment dictates an increasing reli
ance on Special Forces in defence
operations, indicating an expansion
of the current Special Forces capability in the landward, airborne and
amphibious operational domains.
Special Forces capabilities must be
suited to: strategic reconnaissance;
ordered strategic special tasks; deep
reconnaissance in support of the
combat services; and the execution
of Special Forces-unique operations
including, hostage rescue, and urban
and anti-terror operations (Figure
9-10).

60. **Special Operations Forc-**
**es.** Continental leadership responsibilities and the requirement to
protect own vital national interests
require South Africa to configure and
maintain a specialised, highly mobile
combat capability (closely linked to
that of the Special Forces) that is
able to rapidly deploy to remote


-----

areas for specific preventative and intervention operations. Such
Special Operations
Forces must be able to
conduct joint and supported airborne, airlanded and sea-landed
assault operations, with
air- and sea-deployable
firepower, protection
and manoeuvre. Special Forces and Special
Operations Forces will
be supported by joint
defence capabilities,
and will normally be
followed-on by more
robust combat forces,
specifically tailored to
the mission.

61. **Medium-Com-** _Figure 9-9: Core Defence Capabilities_
**bat** **Forces.** The
larger portion of South
Africa’s landward defence capability must be configured and forces would be the bulk of South Africa’s contribution to endurmaintained as a projectable, multi-roled medium-combat ca- ing multinational operations; own safeguarding operations and
pability with enhanced fire-power, manoeuvre and protection other directed tasks. These medium-combat forces will be selfmaking it suitable for a range of contingencies. Such medium supporting, having embedded armour, artillery, engineer, com
munications, intelligence,
logistics, medical support
and other requirements.
This medium capability
may be further augmented
by heavy-combat capabilities. These forces also have
the contingent liability to
support civil authority and
the Police Service, and protect critical infrastructure if
so required.

62. **Heavy- Combat**
**Forces. The configura-**
tion and maintenance of
a heavy-combat capability
are required to deter South
Africa’s potential adversaries and conduct landward
operations in high-threat
situations. Maintained at a

_Figure 9-11: Army Operations Capability_

core-growth level within a self-supporting armour brigade, it will
comprise: armour, mechanised infantry, artillery, combat engineering, communications, intelligence, logistics, medical support

and other requirements.
Although relatively small,
this heavy-combat capability must be able to augment
the combat requirements
of other multi-roled medium and special operations capabilities, specifically
where the threat situation
dictates enhanced protection, firepower and manoeuvre. This core must
be sufficient to expand in
response to changes in the
strategic environment. (Figure 9-11).


tenance of a versatile littoral
maritime capability, a credible deep-ocean capability and effective maritime
domain awareness. This
maritime capability must be
able to provide an enduring
presence in South Africa’s
areas of maritime interest.
This will be pursued through
a maritime defence concept involving deterrence
and powerful intervention
through surface, sub-surface
and air capabilities. This will
be pursued in concentric
layers that are focused on
South Africa’s ports, territorial waters, trade routes and
marine resources. In support
of the landward strategy, the
maritime capability must be
able to conduct riverine and
inland water operations and
augment firepower when
so required. It must also be
capable of strategic reach and joint rapid response across the
spectrum of conflict, supporting the sustainment of protracted
joint operations over long distances. (Figure 9-12).


63. **Maritime Opera-**
**tions.** South Africa has a
maritime-dependent economy and significant maritime interests which it must
defend and protect through
the configuration and main

_Figure 9-12: Naval Operations Capability_

65. **Military** **Health.**
South African forces require
sustained, layered military
health support to protracted
operations over long distances. Such support must ensure
both force health protection
and force health sustainment
(Figure 9-14).

66. Future **information**
**warfare will be conducted**
in parallel with more conventional forms of warfare
in the maritime, land and air
domains. Defence must develop a comprehensive information warfare capability, tied
into other intelligence-related
information systems and
complementary to its other
military capabilities. Defence
must further work closely with

_Figure 9-13: Air Operations Capability_ other government depart
ments and industry to:

64. **Air Operations. South Africa requires a responsive and** a. enhance joint operational capabilities;
agile air defence capability to defend and protect the integrity b. secure vital networks; and
of South Africa’s airspace through the application of air power, c. guide the development of new information warfare
and to support the landward and maritime strategies. The air technologies, practices and capabilities.
defence capability must provide deterrence and powerful in
tervention during joint operations, specifically through
comprehensive air domain
awareness, air combat, combat support and air mobility
capabilities. Deployed landward and maritime forces
must be supported through
appropriate airspace control, reconnaissance, closeair support, augmentation
of firepower and inter- and
intra-theatre air mobility in
complex operational circumstances. The air defence capability must also be capable
of strategic reach and joint
rapid response across the
spectrum of conflict, supporting the sustainment of
protracted joint operations
over long distances. (Figure
9-13).

_Figure 9-14: Military Health Operations Capability_


-----

67. **Defence command and control must be enabled,**
with a specific focus on both operational command and control
and the enablement of administrative information systems. The
information warfare capability must focus on:
a. network warfare;
b. electronic warfare;
c. psychological operations;
d. information-based warfare;
e. information infrastructure warfare; and
f. command and control warfare.


68. The Constitution of the Republic of South Africa[13]: establishes the Defence Force; requires it to “be structured and managed as a disciplined military force”; and provides the “primary
object” of the defence force as being to “defend and protect the
Republic, its territorial integrity and its people in accordance with
the Constitution and the principles of international law regulating
the use of force”.

69. An immediate intervention is required to arrest critical areas of decline in the Defence Force and to create a firm foundation against which an appropriate defence capability can be
developed to be able to sustain ordered commitments and have
the capacity to respond to nascent challenges in the strategic
environment.

70. The restoration of South Africa’s defence capability can be
mapped by quantifying five strategic planning baselines as firm
foundations to direct the development of the Defence Strategic
Trajectory. The following milestones (Figure 9-15) are posited
as the foundation for development of the Extended Long-Term
Defence Development Plan (in the order of twenty-five years),
namely:


**the intent of the above in an Extended Long-Term**
**Defence Development Plan, inclusive of capability**
**development and funding trajectory, and integrate**
**such within the government planning cycle.**

**of the Chief of the Defence Force.**
�� **The Defence Accounting Officer must capture**


_Figure 9-15: The Defence Strategic Trajectory_

13 Constitution, 1996, Chapter 11, Section 200(2), p 113.


-----

a. **Planning Milestone 1: Arrest the decline in criti-**
cal capabilities through immediate, directed interventions.
b. **Planning Milestone 2: Rebalance and re-organ-**
ise the Defence Force as the foundation for future
growth.
c. **Planning Milestone 3: Create the sustainable**
Defence Force that can meet current ordered defence commitments.
d. **Planning Milestone 4: Enhance the Defence**
Force’s capacity to respond to nascent challenges in
the strategic environment.
e. **Planning Milestone 5: Defend the Republic**
against insurgency and/or armed conflict to the level
of limited war.

71. It is important to note that Milestone 5 above reflects the
constitutional mandate to its fullest possible extent. However,
this Defence Review has carefully considered possible, probable and plausible circumstances in the strategic environment,
at both the inter-state and intra-state levels, and thus realistically
posits that:
a. **Milestone 3 must be urgently pursued and**
achieved in the shortest possible time so as to enable the Defence Force to: sustain its current level
of ordered commitments and provide a reasonable
interim level of compliance with the requirements
of the Constitution.
b. **Milestone 4 must be pursued as the appropriate**
**end-state for the Defence Force so that it: appro-**
priately complies with the requirements of the Constitution; has the capability and capacity to respond
to nascent challenges in the strategic environment;
and, in so doing, provides significant deterrence
against strategic risk.
c. **Milestone 5 is not a planning milestone per se, but**
nonetheless reflects and acknowledges that South
Africa must be cognisant of the capability that may
be required to counter significant insurgency and/or
armed conflict to the level of limited war. Thus:
i. Figure 9-15 indicates a ‘critical decision point’
that would have to be addressed before
crossing from Milestone 4 to Milestone 5.
ii. Achieving Milestone 4, however, significantly
reduces strategic risk and therefore minimises
the likelihood of having to cross the threshold
into Milestone 5.
d. It is improbable that the Defence Force will be able
to migrate from its current state of critical decline
to the levels of compliance set out in Milestones 3
and 4 without first implementing specific personnel,
logistic, finance and organisational interventions.


e. **Milestones 1 and 2 are consequently stipulated**
as cardinal steps for establishing a necessary firm
foundation for attaining Milestones 3 and 4. Mile**stones 1 and 2 can be executed concurrently**
**should the resources therefore be available,**
thus shortening the timeframe of implementation.
Notwithstanding, the organisational and capability
interventions indicated in Milestone 1 cannot be ignored.

72. To this end the following factors are identified as being
**critical to the Defence Strategic Trajectory:**
a. The President of the Republic of South Africa, as the
Head of the Executive and the **Commander-in-**
**Chief, champions the Defence Review and directs**
the Defence Strategic Trajectory.
b. The Defence Review and the Defence Strategic
Trajectory have the support of Cabinet and Par**liament.**
c. A **strategic communication intervention is**
developed to pursue a national consensus on Defence.
d. An appropriate defence funding mechanism is
identified and implemented to support the Defence
Strategic Trajectory and as such, the Defence Force
is appropriately resourced along this trajectory.
e. The implementation of the Defence Review and the
Defence Strategic Trajectory is driven as a strate**gic priority by the Cabinet Member responsible**
for defence, the Defence Accounting officer and
the Military Command, with specific emphasis being placed on the **core deliverables and value**
**propositions within each Milestone. This should**
be supported by an appropriate monitoring and
evaluation mechanism.
f. The Defence Review and the Defence Strategic
Trajectory **form the foundation of the Future**
Military Strategy and the Extended Long-Term Defence Development Plan, inclusive of the Blue-Print
Force Design and Force Structure.
g. The implementation of the Defence Review and
the Defence Strategic Trajectory is directed and
cascaded in a coordinated manner by the Defence
Accounting Officer and the Military Command at
all levels within the defence organisation; this being
driven against an interactive and target-driven
**timeline.**
h. **Monitoring and evaluation of implementation**
is instituted at all levels in the defence organisation,
with comprehensive reports being tabled with the
**Executive and the Legislature on a biannual ba-**
sis.

##### PLANNING MILESTONE 1

 ‘ARRESTING THE DECLINE’


###### PRIMARY FOCUS

73. The decline of critical defence capabilities must be arrested through immediate and directed interventions concerning
defence capabilities that may be at risk, be unsustainable or be
necessary for the meeting of current operational commitments.
The primary focus in Milestone 1 is therefore to initiate the defence trajectory through directed organisational and capability
interventions.

###### DELIVERABLES

74. **Direct Implementation. The implementation of the**
Defence Review and the Defence Strategic Trajectory must be
directed through comprehensive ministerial instructions and
guidelines to the Defence Accounting Officer and the Military
Command.
a. The Defence Accounting Officer, in conjunction with
the Military Command, is to develop and promulgate the overarching implementation plan that will
direct all defence components according to targets
and timelines.
b. The Military Command must initiate and complete
the Military Strategy, Blue-Print Force Design, Force
Structure and the Long-Term Defence Capability
Development Plan.
c. A deliberate communication intervention must be
pursued to establish a national consensus on defence
and comprehensively inform the people of South Africa on defence matters.
d. Particular initiatives to develop a culture of military
professionalism at all levels in the Defence Force,
with particular focus on the leadership cadre emphasising accountability and merit-based progression.

75. **Areas of Key Leverage for Milestone 1. The follow-**
ing areas of key leverage are identified in Milestone 1, and are
also the critical success factors for migration to Milestone 2:
a. Applying the 40:30:30 principle, the FY 2013/14 allocation can only sustain a personnel component of
approximately 66 000 Regulars, Reserves and Defence Civilians.
i. Any personnel expenditure significantly larger
than 40% will not provide the financial latitude
for the rebalancing of the Defence Force.
ii. Recognising that the achievement of a 40%
personnel expenditure will have to be achieved


over a period of time, personnel expenditure
should not exceed a 45% ceiling by the end of
Milestone 1.
iii. Right-sizing of the personnel component
would have to be achieved through a government-level intervention, which may include
one or more of the following mechanisms:
(1) The reduction of those fulltime employees who are either: no longer able to
meet their post profile requirements;
who are surplus to the future defence
requirement; or who are close to retirement;
(2) an external intervention to fund personnel above the 66 000 threshold;
(3) a combination of the above; or
(4) an alternate mechanism as established
by Government.
b. Leverage the capital and operating portions of the
defence budget by establishing a mechanism whereby the reimbursement for troop contributions to
multinational peace missions accrues back to Defence for utilisation in the capital and operating portion of the budget.
c. An appropriate defence funding mechanism is identified and implemented to support the Defence Strategic Trajectory, with the following cardinal elements:
i. An Extended Long-Term Defence Development Plan to attain the Defence Strategic Trajectory.
ii. An Extended Long-Term Defence Funding Plan
established by National Treasury to support
the Defence Strategic Trajectory.
iii. A reflection on the Defence Strategic Trajectory in the National Development Plan.

76. **Organisational Interventions. The following organisa-**
tional interventions must be **initiated concurrently so that**
they are in place for the re-balancing of the force required in
**Milestone 2.**
a. **Re-position the Defence Secretariat in order**
that the Secretary for Defence, as the primary tool
and resource for the Minister to exercise civil control, and thus perform the constitutional imperative
to: ‘function under the direction of the cabinet mem_ber responsible for Defence’, with the following sup-_
port being extended to the Minister:
i. Enhancing the Minister’s ability to exercise civil
control over the defence function.
ii. Performing such functions as may be entrusted
by the Minister, in particular those necessary

or any other statute. This would extend to:
(1) The coordination and compilation of
the Presidential Minute and Explanatory
Memorandum, any necessary Cabinet
Memorandum and any Ministerial Directive directing the Defence Force to
conduct such service, and any consequent instruction or direction thereto.
(2) Identifying the legal implications, both
domestic and international, of any
employment.

x. Providing the Minister with legal services (excluding the Military Justice System) which will
entail, inter alia, legislation, litigation and legal
advice.
xi. Engaging with defence stakeholders and managing intra-governmental liaison at the national-strategic and military-strategic levels.
b. **Establish the following in law:**
i. A comprehensive defence delegation regime
whereby powers and duties can be delegated
down the command line – one step at a time
– with commanders at all levels being responsible and accountable for their actions and resources to the next higher commander.
ii. A comprehensive defence organisational
structuring regime whereby the Minister
controls the Defence Macro-Structure and
whereby the Chiefs of Services and Divisions
have the power, authority and duty to manage own subordinate structures within targets
and delegations set by the Defence Accounting Officer and the framework provided in the
Defence Macro-Structure.
c. **Restructure the Defence Force to ensure:**
i. The authority and integrity of the line of mili

to not more than 2% of the total.
f. Establish the mechanisms to recruit, educate,
**train and develop quality future officers, warrant**
officers, non-commissioned officers and defence civilians.The mechanisms thereto must include, inter
alia:
i. Devolvement of military recruitment programmes to the Services.
(1) A unique and dedicated officer recruitment programme for Regulars and Reserves to attract the best young men and
women South Africa has to offer.

_Figure 9-16: Targets for Milestone 1_

-----

i. Initiate necessary processes to attain the defence capabilities required in Milestone 2.

###### TARGETS

78. In Milestone 1 (Figure 9-16), the Defence Force will
broadly:
a. Consist of not more than 72 000 employees inclusive of Regulars, Reserves and Defence Civilians (average of 45% personnel expenditure). This should
comprise in the order of:
i. 47 000 Regulars.
ii. 15 000 Reserves on active service.
iii. 10 000 Defence Civilians, excluding members
of the Ministry of Defence and the Defence
Secretariat.
b. Consist of approximately 66 combat units, including
Army, Air Force, Navy, Special Forces and Military
Health units.
c. Have sustainable funding in the order of R43 bn in
2014/15 Rand value, equating to 1.1% of GDP and
3.6% of Government expenditure.

###### VALUE-PROPOSITION

79. The defence value-proposition for Milestone 1 (Figure
9-17) is posited as:
a. **Internal Operations. One sustainable infantry**
battalion group with associated medical, air and other support, dedicated to cooperate with the Police
Service and conduct other routine internal tasks.
b. **Border Safeguarding Operations. The border**
safeguarding strategy requires:
i. The sustained deployment of five infantry battalions, with appropriate embedded combat
support and combat service support capabilities, in a 1-in-3 rotation-cycle, implying a pool
of 15 battalions to conduct this task appropriately. However, in Milestone 1, a reduced
capacity of four infantry battalions will be deployed in a border safeguarding role in a 1-in-3
rotation-cycle from a pool of twelve infantry
battalions. In Milestone 1, deployed infantry
battalions may not always have the required
combat support and combat service support.
ii. The sustained deployment of a two warships,
with the required embedded capabilities, on
patrol along the east coast and two warships,
with the required embedded capabilities, on
patrol along the west coast of South Africa.
However, in Milestone 1, the funding con

straint implies the limited sustainment of only
two warships for maritime patrol along the
east and west coasts. In some instances such
vessels may not always have all the required
embedded capabilities.
iii. The sustained deployment of two maritime
reconnaissance aircraft on patrol along the east
and west coasts of South Africa. However, in
Milestone 1, the funding constraints and aged
equipment limit the ability to sustain a maritime patrol presence along the east and west
coasts.
c. **Peace Missions. South Africa’s current commit-**
ment to two medium, enduring peace missions can
be maintained in Milestone 1 at the level of a battalion in each instance. In each instance, additional rifle
companies and other support may be added during
mobilisation for a peace mission operation. However, as is currently the case, such peace missions are
constrained by two main factors:
i. A 1-in-3 rotation-cycle in each deployment
area, as opposed to the international norm of
a 1-in-4 rotation-cycle. This has significant implications on morale, health, social and family
stability for the soldier.
ii. Aged equipment that is difficult to maintain
to the serviceability requirements that the international mandating authority may require
in the troop contribution agreement. Such
equipment may also lack the firepower, protection and manoeuvre required for operations in complex and often hostile environments.
d. **Intervention Operations. In Milestone 1, an**
intervention force comprising a single early-entry
combat-group can be deployed to either fulfil South
Africa’s continental obligations or to protect vital national interests. Such an intervention force could be
deployed for a limited duration and would be further
constrained by the following:
i. Limited inter- and intra-theatre air mobility.
ii. Limited air combat support.
iii. The absence of link-up or follow-on forces.
iv. Equipment may lack the firepower, protection and manoeuvre required for operations in
complex and often hostile environments.
e. **Regional Assistance Operations. In Milestone**
1, regional assistance, disaster relief and humanitarian aid can be provided, to the extent that limited air
and maritime lift allows.

##### PLANNING MILESTONE 2

 ‘REBALANCE THE DEFENCE FORCE’


###### PRIMARY FOCUS

80. Building on the organisational and capability interventions
initiated in Milestone 1, the primary focus of Milestone 2 is to
reorganise and rebalance the Defence Force as the platform for
further growth along the Defence Strategic Trajectory. Critical
to the migration from Milestone 1 to Milestone 2 is that the
areas of key leverage identified in Milestone 1 must have been
addressed fully, these being:
a. The defence allocation becomes balanced according to the 40:30:30 principle during Milestone 2.
The current exponential spending on the personnel component is being arrested and normalises at
around 40% of the allocation, thus providing financial latitude to address critical operating and capital
matters.

###### TARGETS

83. In Milestone 2 the rebalanced and reorganised Defence
Force (Figure 9-18) will broadly:
a. Have a personnel complement of approximately


_Figure 9-18: Targets for Mile-_
_stone 2_

101 000 employees inclusive of Regulars, Reserves
and Defence Civilians. This should comprise in the
order of:
i. 64 000 Regulars.
ii. 25 000 Reserves on active service (called-up
and on strength).
iii. 12 000 Defence Civilians, excluding members
of the Ministry of Defence and the Defence
Secretariat.
b. Consist of approximately 97 combat units, including
Army, Air Force, Navy, Special Forces and Military
Health units.
c. Have sustainable funding in the order of R57 bn in
2014/15 Rand value, equating to 1.6% of GDP and
5.4% of government expenditure.

84. The Defence Academy is established and graduates and
commissions in the order of 200 young Regular and Reserve
officers per annum.

###### VALUE-PROPOSITION

85. The defence value-proposition for Milestone 2 (Figure 919) is posited as:
a. **Internal Operations. One sustainable infantry**
battalion group with associated medical, air and other support, dedicated to cooperate with the Police


-----

Service and conduct other routine internal tasks.
b. **Border Safeguarding Operations. In Mile-**
stone 2:
i. The sustained deployment of five infantry battalions, with appropriate embedded combat
support and combat service support capabilities, in a 1-in-3 rotation-cycle, implying a pool
of 15 battalions to conduct this task appropriately.
ii. The limited sustained deployment of two
warships, with the required embedded capabilities, on patrol along the east coast and
two warships on patrol along the west coast
of South Africa.
iii. The limited sustained deployment of two
maritime reconnaissance aircraft on patrol
along the east and west coasts of South Africa.
c. **Peace Missions. South Africa’s current commit-**
ment to two medium, enduring peace missions can
be maintained in Milestone 2 at the level of a battalion in each instance. In each instance, additional
rifle companies and other support may be added
during mobilisation for a peace mission operation.
However, as is currently the case, such peace missions are constrained by two main factors:
i. A 1-in-3 rotation-cycle in each deployment
area, as opposed to the international norm of
a 1-in-4 rotation-cycle. This has significant im

_Figure 9-19: Defence Ca-_
_pability for Milestone 2_

plications on morale, health, social and family
stability for the soldier.
ii. Aged equipment that is difficult to maintain
to the serviceability requirements that the
international mandating authority may require in the troop contribution agreement.
Such equipment may also lack the firepower,
protection and manoeuvre required for operations in complex and often hostile environments.
d. **Intervention Operations. In Milestone 2, a**
combat group-sized intervention force can be deployed to either fulfil South Africa’s continental obligations or to protect vital national interests. Such an
intervention force would, as the capability interventions in Milestone 2 are realised, enjoy progressively
improved:
i. Inter- and intra-theatre air mobility.
ii. Air combat support.
iii. Link-up or follow-on forces.
iv. Firepower, protection and manoeuvre required for operations in complex and often
hostile environments.
e. **Regional Assistance Operations. In Milestone**
2, greater regional assistance, disaster relief and humanitarian aid can be provided as improved air and
maritime inter- and intra-theatre lift is realised.

battalion group with associated medical, air and other support, dedicated to cooperate with the Police
Service and conduct other routine internal tasks.


-----

b. **Border Safeguarding Operations. In Milestone**
3:
i. The sustained deployment of five infantry battalions, with appropriate embedded combat
support and combat service support capabilities, in a 1-in-3 rotation-cycle, implying a pool
of 15 battalions to conduct this task appropriately.
ii. The sustained deployment of two warships,
with the required embedded capabilities, on
patrol along the east coast and two warships,
with the required embedded capabilities, on
patrol along the west coast of South Africa, expandable to the SADC maritime zone.
iii. The sustained deployment of two maritime
reconnaissance aircraft on patrol along the east
and west coasts of South Africa, expandable to
the SADC maritime zone.
c. **Peace Missions. In Milestone 3:**
i. Two large, enduring peace missions can be
maintained at the level of a battalion group in
each instance. In each deployment area a 1-in4 rotation-cycle can be achieved, implying a
pool of eight battalion-sized units to conduct
this task appropriately. In each instance, additional rifle companies and other combat support may be added during the mobilisation for
a peace mission operation.


ii. One additional large enduring peace mission
can be pursued at the level of a combat group.
The combat group would operate in a 1-in-4
rotation cycle from a pool of four constituted
combat groups. In this instance they are reinforced by attached elements from the combat
services, supporting arms and any other specialist military capability to enhance firepower,
manoeuvre and protection.
iii. The efficacy of forces deployed in peace missions will be progressively enhanced by the
improvement in command and control, intelligence, firepower, manoeuvre, protection and
sustainment systems.
d. **Intervention Operations. In Milestone 3, a**
mission-tailored task force of approximately brigade
strength can provide early entry, link-up and followon forces, for a limited duration, to either fulfil South
Africa’s continental obligations or to protect vital national interests. This may possibly comprise:
i. A combat group-sized early entry force drawn
from Special Forces and/or Special Operations
Forces.
ii. A link-up Special Operations Force, reinforced
by attached elements from the combat services, supporting arms and any other specialist
military capability to enhance firepower, manoeuvre and protection.

and secondly, be able to respond to a wide range of strategic
challenges. The capacity of the heavy-combat forces will be
programmatically advanced, from the core-growth level of critical mass, to that of expandable formations which can be made
mission-ready in a shorter space of time.

developments in the strategic environment.

###### TARGETS

95. In Milestone 4 the increasingly capacitated Defence Force
(Figure 9-22) will broadly:
a. Have a personnel complement of approximately
189 000 employees inclusive of Regulars, Reserves
and Defence Civilians. This should comprise in the
order of:
i. 90 000 Regulars.
ii. 82 000 Reserves that can be placed on active
service at any one time.
iii. 17 000 Defence Civilians.
b. Consist of approximately 158 combat units, including Army, Air Force, Navy, Special Forces and Military Health units.
c. Have sustainable funding in the order of R88 bn in
2014/15 Rand value, equating to 2.4% of GDP and
8.2% of government expenditure.

96. The Defence Academy graduates and commissions in the
order of 400 young Regular and Reserve officers per annum.

###### VALUE-PROPOSITION

97. The defence value-proposition for Milestone 4 (Figure
9-23) is posited as:
a. **Internal Operations.** One sustainable infantry
battalion group with associated medical, air and other support, dedicated to cooperate with the Police
Service and conduct other routine internal tasks.
b. **Border Safeguarding Operations. In Milestone**
4:
i. The sustained deployment of five infantry battalions, with appropriate embedded combat
support and combat service support capabilities, in a 1 in 3 rotation-cycle, implying a pool
of 15 battalions to conduct this task appropriately.

reconnaissance/patrol aircraft on patrol along
the east and west coasts of South Africa, expandable in support of surface and sub-surface
maritime deployments.


c. **Peace Missions. In Milestone 4, three large, en-**
during peace missions can be sustained at the level
of a combat group in each instance. In each deployment area a 1-in-4 rotation-cycle can be achieved,
implying a pool of 12 constituted combat groups to
conduct this task appropriately. The efficacy of forces
deployed in peace missions is increasingly enhanced
by improvements in command and control, intelligence, firepower, manoeuvre, protection and sustainment systems.
d. **Intervention Operations. In Milestone 4, a sus-**
tainable mission-tailored task force of approximately
brigade-strength can provide early entry, link-up and
follow-on forces to either fulfil South Africa’s continental obligations or to protect vital national interests. This may possibly comprise:
i. A combat group-sized early entry force comprised of Special Forces and/or Special Operations Forces.
ii. A link-up Special Operations Force, reinforced
by attached elements from the combat services, supporting arms and any other specialist
military capability to enhance firepower, manoeuvre and protection.
iii. A motorised or mechanised follow-on force,
augmented as necessary with heavier combat
capabilities required for the task.

Milestones 1 to 3 become available, the intervention force enjoys greater:
(1) Inter- and intra-theatre mobility.
(2) Landward, air and maritime combat support.
(3) Firepower, protection and manoeuvre as
may be required for operations in complex and often hostile environments.
e. **Operations in the Rear Area. In Milestone 4,**
operations in the rear area would extend to the enhanced and expanded protection of bases, critical
infrastructure, lines of communication and identified
vital national interests in the rear area.
f. **Regional Assistance Operations. In Milestone 4**
significant regional assistance, disaster relief and humanitarian aid can be provided and sustained.


##### PLANNING MILESTONE 5

 ‘LIMITED WAR AND INSURGENCY’


###### PRIMARY FOCUS

98. Should the strategic environment deteriorate to the extent
that South Africa would have to counter a significant insurgency


-----

or repel armed aggression to the extent of a limited war, the
entire national effort would focus on the creation of a war force.

99. It is extremely difficult to predict the nature and requirements of the future war force, as this would be subject to the


_Figure 9-24: Defence Ca-_
_pability for Milestone 5_

specific circumstances at that time. Nonetheless, the solid and
firm foundations created from Milestone 1 to Milestone 4 would
place the Defence Force in a very sound position for development into a ‘war force’ in a reasonably short time.

_Figure 9-25: Targets for_
_Milestone 5_


-----

###### DELIVERABLES

100. The development of a war force would assume priority
over any other defence commitment. Forces committed to any
standing or contingent defence obligations would be reassigned
and redeployed. The focus of main effort would be the rapid
and continued growth of the heavy combat capabilities to that
of mission-ready formations, commensurate with the anticipated
threat. The existing capacity of the Defence Force would be expanded, those forces committed to standing defence obligations
would be re-roled and appropriate additional defence capabilities would be created.

101. The main focus of military effort (Figure 9-24) would be
placed on:
a. The protection of the rear area and all lines of communication.
b. The capability to conduct robust major combat operations in the deep, close and rear.
c. The protection of internal and external vital national
interests.
d. Enhanced strategic alliance and strategic partnering.
e. The positioning of the defence industry in full support of the military requirement.


###### POLICY OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO GOVERNMENT

103. The Defence Strategic Trajectory is intended to broadly
span three cycles of the Medium-Term Strategic Framework.

_Figure 9-26: Policy Options_
_broadly aligned to Three_
_MTSF Cycles_


###### TARGETS

102. As a conservative and non-prescriptive planning figure, and
merely as a basis for further investigation and as would be determined by circumstances at the time, the following may be
necessary (Figure 9-25):
a. A personnel complement of approximately 314 000
employees inclusive of Regulars, Reserves and defence civilians.
b. Approximately 219 combat units, including Army, Air
Force, Navy, Special Forces and Military Health units.
c. Have sustainable funding in the order of R116 bn in
2014/15 Rand value, equating to 3.3% of GDP and
11.0% of government expenditure.
d. The Defence Academy would graduate and commission young Regular and Reserve officers as might
be required.


##### ACHIEVING THE DEFENCE STRATEGIC TRAJECTORY


-----

The following strategic policy options (Figure 9-26) are available
for government to pursue the development of South Africa’s
defence capability.

###### Policy Option 1: Maintain the Status Quo

104. Should for whatever reason the Defence Strategic Trajectory not be pursued by way of either agreement on the trajectory or the funding strategy thereto, the Defence Force would
have to enter into an urgent redesign process to counter its
current state of critical decline and attempt to establish a healthy,
though significantly reduced defence capability that would be focused primarily on domestic matters. Its primarily domestic orientation and reduced capabilities would provide a very limited
capability to: defend territorial integrity, ensure national sovereignty and support South Africa’s continental leadership role.

105. The significantly reduced force design would have to arrest the critical decline in the Defence Force and establish limited capabilities that:
a. are lighter and cheaper with a greater tooth-to-tail
ratio;
b. reduce the overhead costs of headquarters and
command structures to single command corps;
c. establish balance within a lighter force;
d. reside within relatively unsophisticated main operating systems;
e. meet a significantly reduced level of standing domestic and international defence commitments; and
f. promote a spatially dispersed footprint.


106. This significantly redesigned force would have to be modelled according to the following concepts for it to develop utility:
a. A lighter, infantry-based landward capability focused
primarily on internal operations.
b. An air defence capability focused primarily on light,
tactical mobility.
c. A littoral maritime defence capability focused primarily on the protection of territorial waters.
d. A Special Forces capability focused on a limited
spectrum of Special Forces operations.

###### Policy Option 2: Implement the Defence Strategic Trajectory Independently

107. The pursuit of the Defence Strategic Trajectory will, over
time, develop a defence capability capable of conducting major
combat operations in the defence and protection of South Africa, its national sovereignty and territorial integrity. The capability
created would be commensurate with South Africa’s continental
leadership responsibilities, establishing the gravitas required in
support of Africa’s peace and security architecture. The ability
to project forces over long distances and sustain them for protracted periods of time will further bolster South Africa’s continental leadership responsibilities and influence, as well as making
a significant contribution to the security of South Africa’s vital
national interests.

108. Should government wish to pursue the Defence Strategic
Trajectory on a solely national basis, it would take significant time
to establish all the necessary competence and capabilities to

_Figure 9-27: The_
_Force Design Process_


-----

achieve the degree of defence capability set out in Milestone 4.

###### Policy Option 3: Implement the Defence Strategic Trajectory in Partnership

109. Government may consider a course of action that would
shorten the duration of the Defence Strategic Trajectory. In essence, the main point of leverage would be the extent to which
government might decide to pursue the Defence Strategic Trajectory with the assistance of either a strategic partner or a number of strategic partners.

110. Partnering, either with a single strategic partner or with
multiple strategic partners in specific capability areas, would accelerate the overall implementation of the Defence Review and
the Defence Strategic Trajectory, as well as leverage a number of
funding options for the trajectory.

###### THE CONSEQUENT MILITARY STRATEGY AND BLUEPRINT FORCE DESIGN

111. Guided by the Defence Review and the approved Defence Strategic Trajectory, the following will be developed under
the authority of the Chief of the Defence Force:
a. A Military Strategy, inclusive of the Force Design,
Force Structure, establishment table and key resource imperatives (Figure 9-27). This Force Design
should be reviewed at least every five years, or as
required in response to changes in the strategic environment.
b. The Defence Force Long-Term Capability Strategy,
indicating the level of operational capability required


to meet the Defence Policy and the Military Strategy.
c. The Defence Force Capital and Technology Plans.
d. The necessary operational-level military doctrine to
support the Military Strategy. The renewed military
doctrine will in turn lead to renewed military tactics,
techniques and procedures.

112. The Chief of the Defence Force will present the ensuing
Blueprint Force Design to the Minister and Cabinet for approval
and this will serve as an important basis for all aspects of future
planning.

###### RESTRUCTURING THE DEFENCE ORGANISATION

113. Pursuant to the determination of the Military Strategy and
the Blueprint Force Design, it is found that the Defence Force’s
Force Structure will be adjusted to ensure the establishment of
cohesive military combat formations, embedded with own organic support capabilities established ‘under command’ to the
lowest possible functional level. Such organic support capabilities
will include: personnel, finance, information and logistics (equipment, procurement, maintenance and technical services).

###### DEFENCE CAPABILITY PLANNING

114. As is the international norm whereby a defence force communicates its long-term intent to the defence industry and the
public at large, the Minister of Defence will, every three years,
publish a public rolling ten-year defence capital expenditure
statement of intent. In this public document, broad statements
of requirement, coupled to time and targets will be published.

_Figure 9- 28: Balancing_
_the Funding Trajectory_


-----

This will give valuable guidance to the defence industry, increase
general public confidence and assist in guiding interdepartmental
planning.

115. Subject to the determination of the Military Strategy and
the defence capability plan, and the adjustment of priorities over
time, the following initial capability priorities are posited:
a. Priority conventional defence capability.
b. Special Forces capability.
c. Rapid reaction and intervention capability.
d. Force projection capability.
e. Border safeguarding capability.
f. Peace mission capability.
g. Force sustainment capability.

###### EXTENDED LONG-TERM DEFENCE DEVELOPMENT PLAN

116. The achievement of the Blueprint Force Design will be
critically informed by available resources and developments in
the strategic environment. Resource constraints will be ameliorated by adjusting levels of readiness, balancing core-growth
with operational necessity and through a careful mix of Regulars
and Reserves within the one-force approach.

117. The Defence Accounting Officer must ensure integration
and alignment of all subordinate strategy, planning, monitoring
and evaluation and reporting processes to the Defence Review
and the Defence Strategic Trajectory. The Defence Accounting
Officer must further capture the intent of the Military Strategy,
Force Design, Force Structure, capability strategy and acquisition
plan into an extended long-term defence development plan to
achieve the Defence Strategic Trajectory, inclusive of an aligned
funding trajectory, and integrate such within the government
planning cycle.

###### THE DEFENCE PLANNING IMPERATIVE

118. Irrespective of the future level of funding allocated to
defence, the inviolable principle of maintaining the 40:30:30
ratio in the defence budget (at the corporate level) between
the funding of personnel, operating and capital should inform all
defence planning, notwithstanding that some components are
technology heavy and others personnel heavy (Figure 9-28).
a. The ‘compensation for employees’ portion of the
budget should not exceed 40% of the defence budget, and must include an overall minimum of 8%
of the personnel allocation directed to the development and utilisation of the Reserves.
b. The 30% capital portion of the defence allocation
should be directed at urgent equipment requirements to meet defence operational commitments
and the maintenance of a core conventional de

fence capability with the necessary critical mass to
expand when so required.
c. The cost of the MSDS, NYS and other similar personnel systems should be viewed outside of the
40:30:30 rationale and funded separately.

119. The 40:30:30 ratio should be subject to the following caveats:
a. The cost of operational commitments should be
funded additional to the baseline defence allocation
and not form part of the 40:30:30 rationale.
b. Similarly, other ordered and directed developmental tasks given to the Defence Force must be funded
additionally to the base-line allocation and not form
part of the 40:30:30 rationale.
c. The cost of the MSDS, NYS and other similar personnel systems should be viewed outside of the
40:30:30 rationale.

###### BALANCE BETWEEN REGULARS AND RESERVES

120. The day-to-day strength of the Defence Force may reflect
a Reserve to Regular ratio in favour of the Regulars. This may
especially be true in certain service-delivery elements or where
specialist mustering and professions are found.

###### THE DEFENCE BUDGET

121. Defence expenditure is often expressed in terms of a
percentage of the GDP that is allocated to defence. The real
significance of this measure of defence spending is that it is an
indicator of national will. It is a clear indication of how seriously
a country takes its security, of how seriously it takes commitments it has undertaken in respect of regional defence or security arrangements, and how willing it is to face up to unexpected
threats to itself or its region.

122. Consequently, if it is to be effective, the Defence Force
must be funded adequately and appropriately:
a. The defence budget must meet the financial requirements that arise from the roles and mission
sets assigned by government to the Defence Force.
b. The defence budget must provide steady funding
over time, not on a boom or bust cycle, to allow
the Defence Force to equip and train effectively

123. This requirement can be best met by handling defence
funding as four complementary sub-budgets:
a. Defence Force Operating Budget;
b. Defence Force Contingency Budget;
c. Defence Force Capital Budget; and
d. Defence Force Operational Employment Budget.


-----

124. **Defence Force Operating Budget. The operating**
budget must provide the funding to enable the Defence Force to
sustain itself at the strength and readiness levels that are required
to meet standing tasks and identified contingencies as developed
from Defence Policy, as well as the additional operational costs
incurred in respect of standing tasks. The operating budget must,
therefore, provide steady funding to cover:
a. Personnel costs (salaries and allowances; accommodation or allowances; health support; etc);
b. Personnel development costs (education, training,
development; relevant training centres and schools);
c. Unit, formation, joint and multinational field training
exercises;
d. Maintenance, repair and overhaul costs in respect of
equipment and systems;
e. Modernisation of equipment and systems;
f. Maintenance, repair and refurbishment costs in respect of facilities; and
g. The additional operational costs incurred in respect
of standing tasks.

125. **Defence Force Contingency Budget. The contin-**
gency budget must hold sufficient funds to meet the immediate
financial requirements that would arise in the event of certain
identified contingencies arising.
a. Such contingencies can include deployment in support of the Police Service or for disaster aid, emergency relief or search-and-rescue operations, the
financial impact of which can to a reasonable extent
be estimated and planned for.
b. This budget must also, however, provide for such
contingencies as external disaster aid or emergency
relief operations or an emergency evacuation of
South African citizens from another country. Such
contingencies must be identified as early as possible
on the basis of continuous evaluation of intelligence,
so that funds can be transferred into this account in
good time from government contingency funds.

126. **Defence Force Capital Budget. The capital budget**
must provide the planned funding to enable the Defence Force
to equip itself to meet the operational demands arising from the
standing tasks and identified contingencies as developed from
Defence Policy. The capital budget must, therefore, provide
planned, phased funding to cover:
a. Upgrading equipment and systems to meet the demands of evolving operational and tactical requirements;
b. Planned and phased (perhaps on a half-generation
change-over basis) replacement of obsolete or ob

solescent equipment and systems;
c. Acquisition of equipment and systems required for a
force expansion necessitated by a change in:
i. The Defence Policy; or
ii. The strategic situation.
d. Acquisition of equipment and systems required to
develop new force capabilities necessitated by:
i. A change in the Defence Policy;
ii. A change in the strategic situation; or
iii. Technological developments.

127. **Defence Force Operational Employment Budget.**
The employment budget must provide prompt, steady and sustained funding to cover additional costs arising from operational
employment of the Defence Force or elements thereof. Operational employment results from political decisions and must be
funded over and above the sustainment and capital budgets. The
only exceptions are:
a. Standing tasks assigned the Defence Force, and for
which a properly calculated contingency amount is
provided, included in the sustainment budget; and
b. Short-term contingency deployments, the costs of
which are met from contingency budget funds.

128. The operational employment budget must, therefore,
provide prompt, adequate, steady and sustained funding to cover the additional:
a. Personnel costs (deployment allowances; family support; accommodation; health support; etc);
b. Deployment costs (air and sea transport of personnel, equipment and supplies);
c. Sustainment costs (provision of additional depot
stocks to cover higher utilisation rates; maintenance
and repair of deployed equipment; rotation of equipment); and
d. Operational costs (including mission-readiness training costs and the actual cost of operations – munitions, fuel, batteries, field rations, replacement of
equipment damaged or lost in operations).

129. The operational employment budget must, in addition to
the above, provide prompt and adequate funding to cover:
a. Accelerated overhaul or replacement of equipment
and systems resulting from the higher utilisation rates
arising from operational employment; and
b. Acquisition of equipment, systems, munitions or
stores required to allow effective operations in a
particular situation or theatre of operations.

## FORCE GENERATION GUIDELINES


##### DEFINITION OF TERMS


1. It is necessary to clarify the following concepts:
a. **Force Design. The Force Design refers to those**
components of the Defence Force, within the wider Defence Force structure, which can and may be
mobilised for operational deployment or which directly support defence operations.
i. This includes combat, combat support, combat service support as well as command and
control units that may be deployed to execute
operations.
ii. Non-deployable units in the Force Design
may include structures that directly support
deployed forces, such as a military hospital.
b. **Force Structure. The force structure is the com-**
plete structure of the entire defence organisation,
inclusive of the Force Design, and ranges from the
Ministry of Defence at the highest level (Level 0) to
the diverse units at Level 4 in the organisation.


c. **Force Structure Element. A force structure el-**
ement (FSE) is any self-standing organisation in the
Defence Force structure across all levels of the organisation. Each headquarters, combat formation,
school, depot and unit is an individual FSE.
d. **Defence Force ‘Force Structure’. The De-**
fence Force ‘Force Structure’ is the complete master-plan for the full force structure requirement of
the Defence Force. It is the master-plan that includes all present and future capabilities required
for the execution of the defence mandate, reflecting differing states of readiness, differing levels of
equipment sets and indications for the opening and
closing of these units. The defence budget allocation, on the other hand, will determine the extent
to which the Force Structure will be implemented.
Capabilities included in the Force Structure, but
which are not at combat-ready status, may be
described in such terms as ‘virtual’ capabilitiy or
‘core growth’ capability. The Force Structure must
therefore describe the respective readiness levels
of such required capabilities.


-----

2. The Defence Force ‘Force Design’ and Force Structure
is informed by the defence mandate, mission, goals and tasks
coupled to defence doctrine as expanded upon in this Defence
Review.


##### BROAD FORCE GENERATION CONSIDERATIONS


3. As indicated earlier, new global and regional stresses have
emerged and Africa continues to be troubled by multiple stress
factors including the effects of global climate change, the rise of
international terrorism and crime, and the potential effects of a
new scramble for Africa’s resources. Therefore defence against
possible military aggression remains a key imperative in designing
a Defence Force that can pursue both a landward and a maritime
defence strategy, supported by an overarching powerful air defence capability.

4, This implies that the Defence Force must have the ability to conduct a wide spectrum of operations under complex
conditions. This spectrum may range from benign to hostile missions, including the support of other government departments,
humanitarian support, the participation in peace missions and the
defence of South Africa. All of this must be factored in when
determining the Defence Force’s design and structure. The Defence Force must be designed to:
a. Deploy and sustain forces over extended strategic
distances and for protracted periods;
b. Conduct operations within operational theatres that
have extended tactical distances;
c. Contend with diverse threats that may occur in quick
succession or concurrently;
d. Conduct operations in complex political, social and
geographic arenas; and
e. Integrate with other, very different, joint and multinational forces for the conduct of operations, including with other departments and other civilian
organisations.

5. Given these challenges, developing the appropriate Force
Design for the Defence Force is a complex task. While this Defence Review sets out the goals, the capability sets required for
achieving those goals and the level of effort expected of the Defence Force, it remains a fact that there can be no certainty about
the evolving strategic situation, and it is neither possible nor affordable to prepare for every eventuality. Further, the Force Design that is to be developed will affect the defence and security
of South Africa for decades, and will involve considerable investment in human, industrial and financial capital. Given these realities, the only practical approach is to define a long-term Force
Design that provides the balanced capabilities that will:
a. Enable the country to meet existing challenges
effectively;


b. Enable the country to deal effectively with foreseeable contingencies;
c. Be refocused or adapted to meet developing challenges or threats; and
d. Provide the baseline for a more robust force when
required, within a timeframe that is realistic relative
to the strategic situation.

6. The use of a modular approach to Force Design may well
provide the Defence Force with greater numbers of smaller,
highly capable units which have been optimally designed to meet
the requirements for specific missions. Proportionate combat,
combat support and combat service support elements must be
formally configured to meet the requirements for specific deployments and missions.


##### STRATEGIC DEFENCE CONCEPTS


###### COMPLEX WAR-FIGHTING WITHIN COMPLEX ENVIRONMENTS

7. Diverse participants in potential African conflict may include terror groups, bandits, religious extremists, mercenaries,
insurgents, unarmed protesters, environmental groups, formal
militaries and non-state actors. Characteristics may include:
a. Future conflicts will be characterised by uncertain**ty,** **complexity and an increase in** **asymmetry,**
and will not be contained by national borders.
b. The **physical terrain may include urban areas,**
dense bush, forests, mountains, riverine areas,
swamps and desert.
c. Ethnic, cultural, tribal, linguistic and religious diversity,
and operations in the face of ethnic, tribal and religious tensions and conflicts, will produce consid**erable human complexity.**
d. **Complex health threats to deployed forces from**
diseases and environmental conditions.
e. The use of readily available commercial technology
and the adaptation of these technologies, especially
pervasive communications technology and social
media, can create a new level of **technological**
**complexity.**

8. Post-conflict missions can suddenly become as lethal as
pure war-fighting missions, requiring agility to simultaneously execute a wide range of complex missions among foreign populations, as well as in unfamiliar and difficult terrain. Such complex,
highly fluid and lethal environments demand enhanced command and control, protection, mobility, firepower, sustainment
and situational awareness. Such complexity places added emphasis on the need for human intelligence (HUMINT).


-----

###### INTEROPERABILITY

9. Interoperability is principally concerned with the ability
of personnel and systems of different nations and agencies to
work efficiently and effectively together. Future defence operations will probably be conducted in combination with other defence forces, requiring the ability to operate effectively alongside
forces with differing military capabilities, doctrine, language and
cultural backgrounds.

10. Priority must be given to promoting interoperability on
command and control capabilities (processes, policies, doctrine
and procedures) with regional partners, as well as meeting the
needs of regional coalitions. Capability coherence must be created through experimentation and exercises. The initial focus
will be on interoperability in command, control and communication. Interoperability should also address:
a. **Compatibility.** The capability to function in the
same system or environment without mutual interference applies to all systems and organisations.
b. **Inter-changeability. The capability of “being ex-**
changed for the other item without selection for fit
or performance, and without alteration of the items
themselves, or of adjoining items, except for adjustment”[1] applies to combat supplies.
c. **Commonality. A state achieved when groups of**
individuals, organisations or nations use common
doctrine and procedures, or equipment requires
common standards and measurements.

###### RAPID REACTION

11. Security crises can arise overnight both in times of peace
and conflict. These may include imminent danger, grave human
rights violations, threats of a human origin and natural disasters.
**Prompt, highly mobile, rapidly executed military re-**
**sponse** will prevent such crises from escalating and will limit
and alleviate the human security consequences thereof. The
ability to respond rapidly to such contingencies and sustain such
response is a critical component of the defence concept.

###### EXPEDITIONARY

12. **Strategic air, rail, road and sea mobility is crucial**
to South Africa’s contribution to regional and continental security. This necessitates the capability to project and sustain forces
over protracted periods of time and over extended distances
from South Africa, sometimes with limited in-theatre infrastructure. Such capability must comprise strategic inter-theatre and
intra-theatre lift and support, as well as forward-basing on the
continent.


###### CONCURRENT OPERATIONS OF A ‘CAMPAIGN QUALITY’

13. Subject to government direction, defence might have to
**execute several concurrent operations, varying** **across**
**the spectrum of conflict. This calls for sufficient capacity and**
a dynamic and flexible planning process and capability sets that
are responsive to the fluidity of the strategic environment. At
the operational level, multiple operations must be sustainable
over protracted periods of time – thus implying multiple operations of a “campaign quality”. Campaign quality is the ability to
win decisive combat operations and to sustain military op**erations for as long as necessary, while quickly adapting to**
**unpredictable changes both in the context and the character**
of the conflict.

###### JOINT, INTER-AGENCY, INTERDEPART- MENTAL AND MULTINATIONAL (JI[2]M) OPERATIONS

14. Future Defence operations will be based on a JI[2]M ap**proach. Emphasis will be placed on increased collaboration**
with and between Defence, government departments, international organisations, multinational partners, non-government
organisations and volunteer organisations and on addressing
both internal and external matters of security. This will not exclude the coalition of willing allies conducting joint intervention
operations under grave circumstances prior to a multilateral
mandate emerging.
a. Joint operations integrate and synchronise the capabilities to exploit combined potential to **gener-**
**ate joint combat power. Joint forces must have**
the intelligence, command and control, firepower,
protection, mobility and sustainment to engage any
threat found across the spectrum of conflict. The
command and control for JI[2]M operations will include both the methods and the means that a designated commander may employ in the exercise of
authority over assigned forces to accomplish the
mission.
b. Inter-agency and interdepartmental operations, on
the other hand, forge a link between Defence and
other organs of state, as well as between the various
non-governmental organisations (NGOs), private
voluntary organisations (PVOs) and international
organisations (IOs). The objectives are improved
civil-military relations and integration and unity
**of effort.**
c. Both the joint operations and the inter-agency aspects could extend to an international and mul**tinational context.**


1 Hanifan, R., 2014. Concise Dictionary of Engineering. Springer International Publishing, Switzerland.


-----

15. JI[2]M operations will therefore **integrate military and**
**non-military operations, leveraging each participant’s**
strength into unified actions to address multidimensional
**security challenges. Such actions will remain the preferred**
defence choice.


##### DEFENCE OPERATING SYSTEMS


16. Defence doctrine provides that there are six operating
systems. These operating systems constitute the components of
a complete military system and function as a checklist for two
purposes, namely:
a. The planning of operations.
b. Force development.

17. These operating systems should be understood as being interdependent and interrelated. No single operating system can be blindly adhered to or be declared as a priority over
another.

###### COMMAND AND CONTROL 

18. Effective command and control is intended to ensure the
most effective employment of military forces for accomplishing the assigned military objective(s). Command and control
is applied to sequence and synchronise a military unit’s activities in peacetime and orchestrate the use of military as well as
non-military sources of power to accomplish assigned strategic
objectives.

19. Sound command and control ensures unity of effort, provides for centralised direction-giving and decentralised execution
(mission command), provides an environment for applying common doctrine and ensures interoperability. Effective command
and control facilitates unity of effort, being one of the primary
prerequisites of successful performance by military leadership.

###### MOVEMENT AND MANOEUVRE

20. Movement and manoeuvre is one of the most critical aspects for the successful deployment of military forces, as it is
aimed at manoeuvring the military force into a position
**of advantage. This does not only imply the physical aspects**
of movement and manoeuvre, but also seeks to defeat opposing
forces by shattering their psychological and physical cohesion, affecting their ability to fight as an effective and coordinated whole,
as opposed to the physical destruction of the opposing force
through incremental attrition.


###### FIREPOWER

21. Firepower is used to **deliver combat power quickly**
**and at the decisive place and time. Firepower is crucial to**
the success of any military action and includes kinetic and nonkinetic firepower. The latter could be delivered by psychological operations and information operations. To be fully effective,
the firepower operating system must be synchronised with the
other operational functions.

###### INTELLIGENCE

22. Intelligence is a critical function that is used to **support**
**the planning, preparation and execution of military op-**
**erations. It is essential to integrate the intelligence operating**
system into the other operating systems.

23. The primary function of the intelligence operating system is
to enable the taking of well-informed military decisions
based on accurate understanding of the situation. Furthermore,
it is essential that the respective combat services each have a tailored and unique intelligence function to support their contribution to military operations. This implies that each of the combat
services must provide for the full spectrum of intelligence functions: namely intelligence collection, processing, dissemination.

24. The individual intelligence operating systems of Services
should be integrated with others by means of tailor-made protocols, as well as with Defence Intelligence operating systems
which will be used to integrate defence intelligence products.

###### PROTECTION

25. Military as well as non-military sources of power must be
protected. The protection operating system pertains to a series
of physical and non-physical actions and measures conducted
in peacetime, crises and war to preserve the effectiveness
**and the survivability of military capabilities.**

###### SUSTAINMENT

26. Sustainment is intended to provide and maintain an **ef-**
**fective supply system, maintenance, transportation,**
**general engineering, health services and other services**
**to military forces.** The sustainment operating system is thus
used to plan, support and maintain military forces and is used
to ensure a high degree of adequacy, responsiveness, anticipation, integration, flexibility, continuity, simplicity and protection.
In order to exhibit these characteristics, the sustainment operating system must be integrated with the other operating systems
to ensure the sustainment of military force.


-----

##### OVERARCHING DEFENCE CAPABILITIES


###### DEFENCE DIPLOMACY CAPABILITY

27. Defence diplomacy is undertaken to achieve and maintain security cooperation among regional blocs in furtherance of
bilateral defence relations to acquire and procure defence capabilities, implement joint operations and training programmes,
and share critical resources in addressing common threats.

28. The Minister of Defence is responsible for setting the in**ternational defence diplomacy policy and strategy, ex-**
tending to international security issues, bilateral relationships and
multilateral relationships with international defence and security
institutions. The Chief of the Defence Force is responsible for
the execution of defence diplomacy and assisting the Minister
with foreign ministerial commitments.

29. South Africa is committed to the promotion of peace and
stability and to the resolution of conflict by peaceful means. Active participation in multilateral institutions and collective
**security mechanisms is an expression of this commitment.**
South Africa has also entered into a number of international
agreements that entail reciprocal obligations and undertakings
to engage in cooperation in various sectors, including defence.
Such agreements can be legally and financially binding, or merely
an expression of intent.

30. In the post-conflict reconstruction role, there is a **vital**
**linkage to be established between foreign policy, de-**
**fence policy and trade policy. Whilst defence is primarily**
concerned with the arena of security sector reform, other sectors of government must become seized with important concurrent trade and investment initiatives to:
a. Initiate economic development in the country
emerging from conflict, thus linking the axiom of security and development.
b. Unlock economic benefit for South Africa that
could arise from achieved peace and stability on the
continent.

31. The signing and implementation of international defence
agreements are thus a critical policy action and will continue to
play an important role in advancing defence diplomacy, participation in peace missions, cooperation in the defence and related industries, arms control and the non-proliferation of WMD.

32. South Africa also pursues defence diplomacy initiatives
to promote defence cooperation with other states in
**SADC, Africa and beyond. Defence will thus engage in co-**
operative ventures with its counterparts throughout the world


in such fields as training and education, defence planning, exchange visits, multinational exercises, and procurement of military equipment. The deployment of defence attachés is in support of this capability.

33. South Africa’s future defence attachés will be stringently
selected for their military knowledge and operational experience and their ability to champion South Africa and further foreign policy, defence diplomacy and international objectives.

###### COMMAND AND CONTROL CAPABILITY

34. A joint command and control capability is essential to ensure jointness of action with respect to land, air, sea and space as
well as sustainment to support JI[2]M operations in a manner that
sustains coherence between defence concepts and doctrine.
**Military command and control must integrate with inter-**
departmental and inter-agency command and control to ensure
synergised effects.

35. The command and control capability needs to be understood as a collective of the following key enabling elements:
a. Situational awareness that presents the commander
and staffs with relevant information for decision support and decision-making functions.
b. Integrated information acquired through sensors
as a technical platform for both intelligence and
situational awareness. In some instances this is provided through automated command and control
processes.
c. The successful conduct of JI[²]M operations requires
that this joint command and control capability will be
conducted in a manner that:
i. Is coherent across all levels of command.
ii. Provides effective command and control support to commanders and their staffs irrespective of the type of mission, battle space conditions, and the force elements comprising the
operational force.
iii. Heightens interoperability across all the participants in the JI[2]M operation, enabling each
force element to collaborate in synergy with
other force elements and achieve maximum
defence effect.
iv. Exploits computer, sensor and communications technologies to the greatest extent possible, so as to improve situational awareness,
clearly and rapidly communicate intent and
monitor and control the execution of military
missions and tasks.
v. Takes advantage of network-enabled defence
capabilities, thus enabling force elements to


-----

be more adaptable, flexible, responsive and
agile in the conduct of operations.

36. A **single unified chain of command will be pursued**
that ensures the effective and efficient conduct of all activities.
Decisions regarding implementation will be taken at as low a
level as possible with maximum delegations to empower
**lower-level commanders. Commanders are to receive the**
necessary delegations so as to have control over all their designated resources, and are held accountable for their actions.

###### INTELLIGENCE CAPABILITY

37. Continued continental instability will require the involvement of the Defence Force in a variety of complex operational
environments, requiring its intelligence capability to be sensitive
to a more complex world that is prone to rapid changes coupled
to a wide range of challenges. Transnational issues, the asymmetrical threat, Information Warfare, and weapons and technology proliferation will be more difficult to address as a result of
globalisation. At the same time, Defence Intelligence will be
expected to continue monitoring international hotspots, strategic
threats and emerging trends. Defence planners, policy makers
as well as combat forces depend on the intelligence capability to
provide actionable intelligence to execute their missions and to
anticipate and prepare for new challenges.

###### STANDING AND SURGE MILITARY CAPABILITY

38. National security and the defence mission, defence goals
and strategic tasks require a standing military capability and a
surge military capacity.

39.  The standing and surge capacity must consist of supported
balanced land, air, maritime, special force and military health capabilities able to meet various contingencies at short notice.

40.  This standing and surge capability is based on the following
principles:
a. The first principle is that the standing military capability will contain the necessary capabilities and
capacity to execute standing defence commitments.
The standing military capability also provides the
platform for a surge in force levels as required for
dealing with contingent defence commitments. The
standing military capability will comprise both Regulars and Reserves at differing readiness levels.
b. The **second principle is that the expanded mili-**
tary capability as necessitated by surge requirements


will also comprise both Regulars and Reserves, with
the Reserves being the predominant provider of the
surge capability.
c. The **third principle is that a “One Force” ap-**
proach will consequently be pursued, in which the
Regulars (full-time uniform) and the Reserves (parttime uniform) will constitute an integrated Defence
Force. These components are integrally reliant on
each other for a cohesive combat capability. The Reserves are represented at all levels in Defence and
are maintained at a sufficiently large scale to provide
capacity on a day-to-day basis and for force level
surges when required.
d. The fourth principle is that such surge capability is
supported by the defence industry and the national
stock reserve.

41. The balance between Regulars and Reserves may change
from time to time. Whereas in the standing military capability the
number of Regulars may be greater, the number of Reserves will
be greater in the surge capability.[2]

42. Combat command and control, administration and support structures must be able to expand from peacetime to
wartime capacity, in accordance with early warning predictions,
through the Reserves. This expansion capacity will be seen as
an integral facet of the defence structure. All defence structures
that must be able to expand more rapidly than normal recruiting
will allow, will have an appropriate Reserve component. The dynamics of the Reserves differ from those of the Regulars and, as
a result, the management approaches to these two components
will differ.

43. The **Reserve component, as an important part of the**
Defence Force surge capability, must therefore be designed,
structured, maintained and resourced to be able to:
a. Augment the Regulars in on-going operations and
the day-to-day activities of the Defence Force.
b. Form part of both the standing and surge military
force capability.
c. Provide the expansion capability of the Defence
Force for major combat operations and crisis
response.
d. Provide certain specialist and scarce skills to the Defence Force.
e. Provide the main specialist capabilities for reconstruction and development.
f. Enhance the relationship between the Defence
Force and the public and private sectors.


2 The ratio between Regulars and Reserves is discussed more substantially under the chapter on Defence Strategic Trajectory.


-----

###### EXPEDITIONARY CAPABILITY

44. Expeditionary operations require a balanced rapid response capability of forces that can meet the demands of the
particular situation, and that can be projected and supported by
air or sea at the inter- and intra-theatre levels. The success of
such operations will hinge on the ability to exploit manoeuvre,
surprise, night-fighting capability, superior command and control, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance.

45. This capability will consist of highly mobile, rapidly deployable **special operations forces able to meet contingencies**
during times of peace and conflict. The capability will be comprised of airborne and seaborne elements with air-droppa**ble, air-landed (fixed and rotary wing) and sea-landed abili-**
ties[3] with the required medical and logistic support. The success
of these operations will hinge on the availability of intelligence
before and during the operation.

46. The strategic projection of the response capability may
occur from own soil through land, air and sea and/or from forward-positioned land or sea bases. It will have limited tactical
mobility and therefore be vulnerable until link-up forces arrive.
In-theatre air transport will provide tactical and operational mobility and will enable the dispersion and concentration of forces
as required. Combat helicopters will greatly enhance tactical
and operational firepower and limit force vulnerability.

###### DEFENCE SCIENCE, ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY CAPABILITY

47. Science, engineering and technology (SET) will be one of
the major power bases of the future South African state. As a
developing nation, South Africa is currently fortunate to have
a strong SET capability in some areas which can be used as a
future force multiplier for the Defence Force.

48. A growing percentage of relevant defence technologies is
developed in the commercial domain, resulting in defence forces
becomingly increasingly reliant on the use of commercial technologies. An agile defence force will need to exploit technology
opportunities through rapid technology acquisition, use of civil
technologies and infrastructure, and rapid adaption and creation
of new doctrine and tactics, as well as their implementation.

49. Fewer nations are able to design, develop and produce
new weapon systems due to the rise in complexity and cost.
Current trends indicate that there will be increasing multinational collaboration to develop new weapon systems. This
requires the concerted development of a strong Defence Sci
3 Medium strategic lift.


**ence, Engineering and Technology (DSET) capability to**
become a smart-buyer of weapon systems, to effectively participate in international collaborative efforts and have the required
depth of know-how to support and upgrade technologies.

50. Having a strong DSET will further allow the Defence
Force to leverage the capabilities of the national SET spectrum
to meet future defence demands.


##### GENERAL FORCE GENERATION GUIDELINES


51. The uncertain and continuously evolving strategic situation
requires a Defence Force that is:
a. **Intellectually agile, able to understand the evolv-**
ing strategic situation and derive from it the key implications for South Africa;
b. **Continuously evolving its concepts, doc-**
trines, organisation and training to keep ahead of
developments;
c. Able to adapt promptly and quickly to sudden, unforeseen challenges and threats; and
d. **Resilient, able to recover quickly and without loss**
of cohesion from mishaps and setbacks.

52. The Defence Force must, further, be appropriate, adequate and cost-effective. The force planning construct must
include various levels of defence aligned to possible levels of
funding.
a. **Appropriate to the strategic situation in structure,**
organisation, composition, doctrine, equipment,
training and education, with specific focus on the
built-in flexibility to adapt quickly to changes in the
strategic situation.
b. **Adequate to meet the demands likely to be made**
on it, in terms of its standing and surge strength, logistic and technical support capacity, reserves of fuel,
munitions and stores to sustain extended operations, and the funding to train and maintain forces.
c. **Affordable in terms of financial and opportunity**
cost. While there can be ‘military luxuries’, unnecessary duplications and wasteful procedures, it is not
always simple to define what is ‘affordable’, and decisions in this regard are fraught with risk and must
be considered in the light of practical experience
and the experience of other defence forces.
d. **Aligned levels of ambition and intent between**
the Services and the engineering of the Defence
Force as a system of systems with the elimination of
duplication.


-----

##### GENERAL FORCE GENERATION REQUIREMENTS


53. The required capability sets and levels of effort defined in
this Defence Review contain certain overlaps in terms of FSEs.
In determining a Force Design this has to be taken into consideration to avoid unnecessary and costly aggregation while still
providing for potential concurrency of the missions and tasks falling to the Defence Force.

54. Developing an effective military capability is a long-term
process, both because equipment takes time to acquire and
bring into service and because it takes time to develop and grow
officers and non-commissioned officers. The realistic planning
horizon for full implementation of the Force Design will be thirty
years hence. This implies certain unavoidable short-term vulnerabilities. In order to mitigate these, the Defence Force must:
a. Exploit technology to increase the effectiveness and
lethality of its forces in order to deter conflict conditions from developing; and
b. develop doctrines and the capabilities of its FSEs to
maximise their operational and tactical utility.

55. The Force Design therefore provides the framework for
acquiring the right military capabilities needed for the short, medium, long and extended long term based upon the evolving
strategic situation. In the short to medium term the requirements of Goals II to IV together with those specified for Goal I
in the Short-Term Force Employment Guidelines are to be addressed, with the full capabilities required for Goal I to be addressed in the long to extended long term.

56. In addressing the above, acquisition must be so phased as
to provide for a consistent multi-year funding commitment that
will ensure the long-term viability of the South African Defence
Industry and will avoid block obsolescence of prime mission
equipment in future.

57. In operationalising the Force Design, cognisance is to be
taken of the service specific requirements laid down. It is, therefore, the preserve of the Defence Force to operationalise the
Force Design through a detailed force design and implementation planning process.


##### SOUTH AFRICAN ARMY


###### ARMY CAPABILITY

58. The South African Army, as the major component of the
landward defence strategy and supportive of the maritime defence strategy, is required to remain balanced, robust and rele

vant in relation to the evolving nature of warfare, with enhanced
manoeuvrability, firepower and protection.
a. Continental leadership responsibilities and the requirement to protect own vital national interests
require South Africa to configure and maintain a
**specialised, high-readiness, highly mobile**
**combat capability (closely linked to that of the**
Special Forces) that is able to rapidly deploy to remote areas for specific preventative and intervention operations. Such special operations forces must
be able to conduct joint and supported airborne,
air-landed and sea-landed assault operations, with
air- and sea-deployable firepower, protection and
manoeuvre. Special Forces and special operations
forces will be supported by joint defence capabilities,
and will normally be followed-on by more robust
combat forces, specifically tailored to the mission.
b. The larger portion of South Africa’s landward defence capability must be configured and maintained
as a projectable, multi-roled medium-combat
**capability with enhanced firepower, manoeu-**
**vre and protection, making it suitable for a range**
of contingencies. Such medium-forces would be the
bulk of South Africa’s contribution to enduring multinational operations, own safeguarding operations
and other directed tasks. These medium- forces will
be self-supporting, having **embedded armour, ar-**
tillery, engineer, communications, intelligence, logistics, medical support and other requirements. This
medium capability **may be further augmented**
**by heavy-combat capabilities. These forces also**
have the contingent liability to support civil authority
and the Police Service, and protect critical infrastructure, if so required.
c. The configuration and maintenance of a **heavy-**
**combat capability are required to deter South**
Africa’s potential adversaries and conduct landward
operations in high-threat situations. It must be
maintained at a **deployable core-growth level**
**within a self-supporting armoured brigade,**
with a balanced composition inclusive of: armour,
mechanised infantry, artillery, engineer, communications, intelligence, logistics, medical support and
other requirements. Although relatively small, this
heavy-combat capability must be able to augment
the combat requirements of other multi-roled medium and special operations capabilities, specifically
where the threat situation dictates enhanced protection, firepower and manoeuvre. This core must be
**sufficient to expand in response to changes**
**in the strategic environment.**


-----

59. The South African Army combat capability sets will include:
a. **Command, Control, Surveillance and Infor-**
**mation. A command, control, surveillance and in-**
formation capability is required for the effective conduct of landward operations. This is to be provided
through static and mobile platforms and sensors
for landward operations. The South African Army
command and control system will be embedded in
the headquarter elements of divisions, brigades and
battalions with the requisite C[4]I[2]RS.[4] The deployable elements of the divisions, brigades and battalions will provide the foundation for joint tactical
command and control capacity to deployed South
African Army forces.
b. **Intelligence.** Army intelligence will provide tactical intelligence regarding opposing forces, terrain,
population and other factors that must influence detailed tactical planning and the successful execution
of operations. Army intelligence must be mandated
to operate across the full intelligence cycle, namely:
collection, processing and dissemination. Members
of the Army Intelligence Corps must be competent to translate information and intelligence into
evidence to be submitted in courts of law, especially
in the instance of border safeguarding operations.
The landward intelligence operating system must be
effectively integrated into the Defence Intelligence
Operating System, which will provide electronic
overview but will not directly command landward
intelligence operations.

_Figure 10-1: SA Army Land Command_


c. **Signals. Army signals will provide information and**
communication systems and services. Capabilities
will include tactical communication equipment, satellite communication systems, deployable local area
network capabilities, maintenance and repair on
ICT equipment and electronic warfare capabilities.
d. **Artillery. Artillery will provide effective direct and/**
or indirect light and/or medium fire support during landward operations, using a suite drawing on
air-transportable and/or air-droppable guns, towed
and/or self-propelled guns, rocket launchers and
heavy mortars.
e. **Air Defence Artillery. Air defence artillery will**
provide, in cooperation with the Air Force, protection of the Army and prevent opposing aircraft
from interfering with own operational plans. This is
achieved by making use of guns, missiles and radar
to counter air attacks. Air defence artillery guns may
also be used in the ground role.
f. **Infantry. The infantry will engage and destroy op-**
posing forces and hold ground. The infantry will use
mechanised, motorised, airborne and light infantry
capabilities. Highly mobile, rapidly deployable infantry will be airborne, air-landed and sea-landed. Other special infantry may use specialised equipment,
such as motorcycles, dogs, horses, etc.
g. **Armour. Armoured units provide mobile, pro-**
tected firepower and contribute to deterrence.
Armour further dominates the battle space through
fire and manoeuvre and physical and psychological

-----

shock. Armoured units will penetrate enemy positions and destroy priority targets behind the enemy
front line. Armoured units employ main battle tanks,
armoured cars, missiles and light armoured reconnaissance vehicles.
h. **Engineers. Army engineers will enhance own force**
mobility and impede opponent mobility. These aspects are provided through combat engineering,
terrain intelligence, operational construction and
other support capabilities. Other specialist skills will
include construction, demolition, water purification,
well drilling, countering IEDs, capabilities related to
subsurface and/or urban conflict and to acquire, produce and manage geographic information.

###### ARMY FORCE DESIGN

60. Figure 10-1 provides the end state SA Army Land Command (Milestone 4 in the Defence Strategic Trajectory).

61. The Army’s operational forces are to be grouped under a
Land Command, with the combat elements organised into brigades grouped into three divisions, each of which has a specific
operational focus. In addition, some specialised elements will be
under direct command of the Land Command. The three divisions are:
a. A Mechanised Division, which will be the primary
Army component of the overall deterrent capability, and which will provide medium and heavy force
elements for peace enforcement and similar operations. This division is to have three brigades being an
armoured brigade (tanks and mechanised infantry),
a mechanised brigade (mechanised infantry and armoured cars) and a motorised brigade (infantry and
armoured cars) as well as divisional troops such as
reconnaissance, medium artillery, air defence and
engineers.
b. A Motorised Division, which will provide border
and rear area protection elements and the main
force elements for peace support and similar operations. This division is to have six motorised infantry
brigades. Some of the infantry battalions of these
brigades must be multi-roled as light forces and others also developed for complex environments, such
as mountain and forest operations. The divisional
troops include some light armour and light artillery.
c. A Contingency (Special Operations) Division,
which will provide a rapidly deployable capability as
well as the highly mobile elements to support the
other divisions. The contingency division’s highly
mobile airborne brigade, air-landed brigade, sealanded brigade and division troops will be structured


and equipped to support deep operations, rapid deployment and early entry and follow-on forces.

62. It is important to note that the Defence Force is no longer
structured to manage the protection of critical infrastructure following earlier decisions to move this function to the Police Service. The implication would be the re-establishment of capacity
in the Defence Force to undertake such a mandate as a contingent liability. The Defence Force may consider strengthening its
reserve units and realigning their footprint for this purpose.

63. As the future force design will only be achievable over
the long term, the interim focus (Milestone 3) is to be on the
motorised division, a contingency brigade (building block of the
contingency division) and an armoured brigade (building block of
the mechanised division). Current capabilities are to be developed into multi-mission units with more lethal asymmetric capabilities that can execute a range of missions across the conflict
spectrum and serve as interim counters to larger conventional
forces. These multi-mission capable forces will be established
at battalion and combat group level, and will be suitably armed
and equipped to give the required multi-role capability, with particular emphasis on highly mobile, medium and specialist infantry
capabilities. These units will be structured to allow rapid aggregation in various proportions for customised, mission-oriented
application. They will also be capable of full integration with the
military capabilities of the SADC Standby Force.

64. In the short term (Milestone 2) the focus will be on the reestablishment of brigade and division structures. In the long term
(Milestone 4) the focus will be on the renewal of the mechanised
capability.

65. The specialised elements under the direct command of the
Land Command, include:
a. A Civil-Military (CIMIC) Cooperation capability, responsible for cooperating with civilian communities and authorities in operational areas to minimise
disruption of life during operations and to facilitate a
swift commencement of post-conflict reconstruction.
Every unit will require a CIMIC capability, including
the multi-roling of other capabilities to achieve this
requirement.
b. A Psychological Warfare capability, responsible
for psychological operations against hostile forces
and for establishing broad communication with the
local communities.

###### ARMY MIGRATION PRIORITIES

66. As an immediate intervention (Milestone 2), the South African Army will seek to consolidate its existing force structure


-----

within the context of a Land Command comprising one division
and two brigades, notably:
a. A motorised division.
b. A contingency (special operations) brigade.
c. An armoured brigade, containing one-of-a-kind
as a preservation mechanism.

67. The above will be the initial building blocks towards the
attainment of the future force structure as described earlier.

68. In the short term (Milestone 2):
a. The Air Force is required to support the Army
through:
i. Enhanced medium air lift (fixed and rotary
wing) for rapid response.
ii. Appropriate (fixed and rotary wing) close air
support.
b. The Special Forces are required to support the
Army in the development of its Special Operations
Forces.

69. In the medium term (Milestone 3):
a. The Air Force must establish its heavy air lift (fixed
and rotary wing) for inter- and intra-theatre mobility.
b. The Navy must be able to sea lift a battalion group
in one wave.

70. The consolidation of the existing capabilities and the development thereof towards the future force structure will be
pursued in the following manner:
a. A **steady and sustained consolidation of the**
mechanised elements of the South African Army,
such as the mechanised infantry, artillery, air defence
artillery and armour, and building these towards an
accelerated growth in the medium to longer term.
b. An **accelerated initial growth path for the**
special operations and motorised forces, airborne
forces, intelligence and engineer elements that are
used mainly in the support of international commitments, border safeguarding and rapid reaction.

71. The practice of multi-roling and multi-skilling of units and
the raising of Reserves will continue as critical tools contributing
to the South African Army’s ability to sustain its force provision
obligations.


##### SOUTH AFRICAN AIR FORCE


###### AIR FORCE CAPABILITY

72. South Africa requires a responsive and agile air defence
capability to deliver air power to defend and protect the integrity of South Africa’s airspace and support the landward and


maritime defence strategies. The air defence capability must

distribution of mass freight, fuel, commodities,
weapons and ammunition for joint forces.

###### AIR FORCE ‘FORCE DESIGN’

76. Figure 10-2 provides the end state SA Air Force Air Command (Milestone 4 in the Defence Strategic Trajectory).

77. The SA Air Force’s operational forces are to be grouped
under an Air Command, with the combat elements organised
into squadrons.

78. As it will take time to achieve the full set of capabilities
required, the immediate focus (Milestone 2) must be on enabling greater tactical flexibility on the part of the land forces
deployed on border safeguarding and closer integration of combat support helicopter capabilities with the Army. In addition,
the short-term focus must be on increasing the VIP transport
capability, introducing both medium strategic lift and maritime
reconnaissance capabilities and the renewal of the light fixedwing transport capability and the mobile and static radars for
airspace control.

79. In the medium term (Milestone 3) the requirement is to
replace the medium fixed-wing transport and the acquisition of
an air early warning capability. In the longer term the focus is to
shift to renewal and expansion of existing fighter and helicopter
capabilities to the required levels.

###### AIR FORCE MIGRATION PRIORITIES

80. In migrating towards the future SA Air Force force design,
priority emphasis must be given to:
a. Meeting the full requirements for VIP air transport.

###### NAVY FORCE DESIGN

84. Figure 10-3 below provides the end state of the SA
Navy Fleet Command (Milestone 4 in the Defence Strategic
Trajectory).

85. The SA Navy’s operational forces are to be grouped under a Fleet Command, with the combat elements organised


into the following mission-focused squadrons, each of which has
a specific operational focus. The squadrons are responsible for
doctrine development in respect of their missions, for the dayto-day operation of their ships, for the training of crews and for
the routine maintenance of their ships. These squadrons are:
a. **Autonomous Warfare Squadron. This squad-**
ron is part of the primary naval component of the
overall maritime deterrent capability. It is responsible for maritime defence, maritime strike, interdiction, distant patrols, escort of important vessels,
anti-submarine operations, naval gunfire support for
sea-landed and Special Forces operations and for
surface reconnaissance operations.
b. **Submarine Squadron. This squadron will consist**
of the SA Navy’s submarines. It too forms part of
the primary naval component of the overall deterrent capability. It is responsible for strategic surveillance and reconnaissance, interdiction of hostile
shipping, support for Special Forces operations and
anti-submarine operations.
c. **Patrol Squadron. This squadron is to comprise**
the SA Navy’s patrol vessels. It is responsible for
safeguarding South Africa’s EEZ, its territorial waters
and port approaches. The squadron is also to provide forces for patrol support to friendly countries
and patrol support to other countries as foreseen
by the SADC Maritime Security Strategy (MSS)
and the African Integrated Maritime Strategy 2050
(AIMS-2050).
d. **Combat Support Squadron. This composite**
squadron is to comprise the SA Navy’s combat support ships, its hydrographic survey vessel and the
still to be acquired heavy sealift vessels. In addition
to meeting South Africa’s maritime survey needs this
squadron is to be responsible for providing an unopposed ship-to-shore landing capability for the Army’s sea-landed forces through a major harbour, or
by means of landing craft through a minor harbour,
and for on-station support of such landed forces. It
is further responsible for providing an afloat support
base for forces engaged in littoral operations, for
non-combatant evacuation operations, for disaster
aid and emergency relief operations and for transport or support missions.
e. **Marines. The SA Navy’s current maritime reac-**
tion squadron will be reconstituted as a composite
marines capability established for combat support to
the Fleet and other defence combat formations, cooperation with the Police Service and to assist civil
authority in times of need. This composite capability
will comprise a rapid reaction component, an operational boat component, an operational diving component and an underwater security component.


-----

i. The rapid reaction component will be configured loosely around a special-infantry capability, responsible for providing protection of
static and forward bases, reaction forces for
the protection of naval bases and stations and
boarding and protection parties for deployed
vessels. In times of special need this may extend to the deployment of protection teams
embarked on merchant shipping in a Maritime
Security Patrol Area (or similarly intended international reporting or security mechanisms).
ii. The operational boat component will be responsible for the seaward protection of naval
bases and stations and commercial harbours,
for conducting riverine and lake operations and
for providing boarding forces.
iii. The operational diving component will be responsible for clearance diving and explosive
ordnance/hazardous matériel disposal.
iv. The underwater security component will be
responsible to detect and neutralise asymmetric underwater threats against infrastructure or
vessels.
f. **Mine Warfare Capability. This capability is to**
provide the SA Navy with a defensive and offensive
mine warfare capability. It is to be so configured
that it comprises components organic to the other
squadrons.

###### SA NAVY MIGRATION PRIORITIES

86. As it will take time to achieve the full set of capabilities
required, the immediate focus (Milestone 2) must be on providing an extensive maritime domain awareness capability and an
offshore patrol capability.

87. In the medium term the focus is to be on acquiring heavy
sealift vessels for the SA Army’s sea-landed infantry capability and
on acquiring additional combat support ships (Milestone 3). At
the same time the protection force is to be expanded to battalion size units.

88. The medium-term focus (Milestone 3) includes the renewal of the frigates and submarines and on the improvement of
the mine warfare capability.

89. As is the case with the SA Army and SA Air Force, it will
take considerable time to bring the Navy to the strength and
capability mix required by regional responsibilities.


90. In migrating towards the future SA Navy force design, priority emphasis must be given to:
a. Maritime capabilities required for the safeguarding of
South Africa, with specific emphasis on border safeguarding and meeting the full requirements of the
national maritime security strategy.
b. Inter-theatre and intra-theatre lift in support of landward deployments, with specific attention to the
maritime capabilities required for rapid reaction and
Special Forces operations. In the short-term the SA
Navy must be able to sealift a battalion group in one
wave. In the longer term, the SA Navy must be able
to sealift a Brigade in multi-waves.
c.    The hydrographic obligations of the South African
maritime zone.

##### SOUTH AFRICAN MILITARY HEALTH SERVICE

###### MILITARY HEALTH CAPABILITY

91. The SA Military Health Service will prepare, provide and
deploy military health capabilities to support the landward and
maritime defence strategies, inclusive of the air defence and
Special Forces components thereof. The SA Military Health
Service must be able to conduct and sustain layered mili**tary health support to protracted operations over long**
**distances. Such layered health services will ensure both force**
**health protection and force health sustainment.**

92. The SA Military Health Service capability sets will include:
a. **Command and Control.** A medical command

configured as level 2 hospitals in peace support operations. Level 2 hospitals are generally established at existing infrastructure, and
include specialist diagnostic resources, specialist surgical and medical capabilities, ancillary
health services, dentistry, psychology and social work.


8 The additional role for dental personnel during combat operations is to augment the combat casualty care capability. This is particularly required during mass casualty operations.

iv. **Military Hospitals. The military hospital**
facilities are positioned in specific geographical locations, based on the military footprint,
to render a comprehensive hospitalisation
service to patients. These capabilities are also
utilised in support of operations. Military hospitals render secondary and tertiary levels of
care including rehabilitation functions. These
can be configured for level 4 hospitals in peace
support operations and normally comprise
specialist surgical and medical procedures,
reconstruction, rehabilitation, convalescence,
and psychological and social support.
v. **Specialised Institutes. Specialised institutes**
render a specialist function in specific areas of
military medicine through specialised capabilities and research.

###### MILITARY HEALTH FORCE DESIGN

93. Figure 10-4 provides the end state SA Military Health Service Medical Command (Milestone 4 in the Defence Strategic
Trajectory).

94. The Military Health Service provides combat service support. This is done through force health protection of deployed
elements of the combat services and force health sustainment
of non-deployed military personnel and their dependants, military veterans and their dependants and other designated persons. The Force Design of the SA Military Health Service must
therefore be such that it can meet these responsibilities. To this
end capabilities are grouped under a Medical Command and or

ganised into **a level 4 base hospital, and three military**
**health brigades, each with a** **level 3 specialist hospital**
each with battalion groups under command, The battalion
groups will consist of both static and deployable elements,
these being medical task groups, level 2 static medical facilities
inclusive of sick bays and/or deployable level 2 field hospitals.

95. The three military health brigades will be aligned and
organised to support the mechanised division, motorised
**division and contingency brigade of the SA Army respec-**
tively. The military health brigade supporting the con**tingency brigade will also support the SA Air Force and**
**the SA Navy.**

96. The military health brigade headquarters assigned to support the army divisions are to be geographically co-located
**with** these **divisional headquarters. The** **medical task**
**groups of the medical battalion groups are to be assigned to**
**the combat formations they support.**

###### MILITARY HEALTH MIGRATION PRIORITIES

97. In migrating towards the future SA Military Health Service
Force Design:
a. **Priority emphasis must be given to the** **estab-**
**lishment of the medical brigades and their sub-**
ordinate structures.
b. Consideration is to be given to establishing a dedicated SA Military Health Service military police element to have “own” military police capability under
command during operations.

##### SOUTH AFRICAN SPECIAL FORCES


###### SA SPECIAL FORCES CAPABILITY

98. The SA Special Forces shall be organised as a Special
Forces Command under command of the Chief of the Defence
Force, operating in support of the landward and maritime defence strategies, and for the conducting of specific Special Force
operations.

99. South Africa’s increasingly complex and unstable security
environment dictates an increasing reliance on SA Special
**Forces** in defence operations, indicating an expansion of the
current Special Forces capability in the **landward, airborne**
**and amphibious operational domains. SA Special Forces**
will be competent in the physical, informational and psychological dimensions of warfare.

100. The SA Special Forces must be balanced, technologically
advanced and able to conduct and sustain protracted operations
over long distances and across the spectrum of conflict. The SA
Special Forces capabilities must be suited to: strategic recon**naissance; ordered strategic tasks; deep reconnais-**
**sance and other tasks in support of the combat ser-**
**vices; and the execution of SA Special Force operations**
including hostage rescue, urban and anti-terror operations.

101. The SA Special Forces shall be employed as an enabler
throughout the spectrum of operations, requiring the maintenance of a small but permanently ready force for the conduct of **joint or autonomous military operations, or in**
**collaboration with Police Service task forces and other Spe-**
**cial Forces capabilities within the region.**

102. Special Forces intelligence will provide tactical intelligence
regarding the opposing force, terrain, population and other fac

tors that influence detailed tactical planning and the successful
execution of operations. The summated tactical intelligence picture will be fed up the operations staff line to the operational and
strategic levels.

103. The Special Forces Command will not be structured with
their own inherent air, naval and support assets. Services and
Divisions have a distinct responsibility towards ensuring the strategic capability of Special Forces through participation in Special
Forces training and employment, as well as identified specialist elements to render Special Forces support. Personnel and equipment provided in support of such training and operations must
meet the rigorous criteria demanded in this specialist environment. The following, inter alia, will be established in the Special
Forces Command to meet the operational requirements of the
Defence Force:
a. Command and control capability.
b. Triphibious capability (airborne, amphibious, urban
and anti-terror combat capability).
c. Special Forces training capability.
d. Special Forces support capability.

104. Related defence acquisitions pursued by other Services and
Divisions should be supportive of Special Forces requirements.
Included are heavy and medium fixed-wing lift and air supply,
heavy rotary-wing lift and interoperability with naval assets.

105. The SA Special Forces have a responsibility to support
the SA Army in establishing its contingency (special operations)
capability.

###### SPECIAL FORCES ‘FORCE DESIGN’

106. The SA Special Forces will consist of operational regiments
that will specialise in airborne and amphibious strategic reconnaissance as well as urban and anti-terror operations. The SA
Special Forces will have responsibility for strategic reconnaissance

_Figure 10-5: Special_
_Forces Capabilities_


-----

and other strategic tasks, for deep reconnaissance in support of
the combat services and for the execution of certain special operations, amongst others hostage rescue outside South Africa.
Figure 10-5 below demonstrates the required Special Forces
capabilities (Milestone 4 in the Defence Strategic Trajectory).

###### SPECIAL FORCES MIGRATION PRIORITIES

107. In migrating to the future Special Forces force design, pri**ority emphasis (Milestone 2) must be placed on increasing**
**the capacity of the existing regiments by one Special**
**Forces commando each (including resources, infrastructure,**
housing, etc) to be able to deal with the diversity of tasks emanating from the Defence Environmental Analysis and Defence
Intelligence Estimate. In the medium term (Milestone 3) it will
entail the establishment of an additional Special Forces
**regiment. Given the sensitive nature of some of the tasks, the**
organisation must have an inherent capacity to protect itself in
high-risk environments.

108. A unique approach to recruitment, training, termination
of service and leadership development is required to **ensure**
**that Special Forces personnel are effectively managed.**
Conditions of service need to reflect these unique requirements.
Personnel need to conform to the highest level of security
clearance.


##### INFORMATION WARFARE


109. Command and control must be enabled across the Defence Force, with a specific focus on both operational command

_Figure 10-6: Information Warfare Capabilities_


and control and the enablement of administrative systems.

110. The Defence Force is to take the lead in providing for
common defence against an attack intended to disrupt or disable
South Africa’s key national information systems and infrastructure. To this end the Defence Force will develop comprehensive
defensive Information Warfare capabilities, which will be tied into
the intelligence-related information systems of the intelligence
services.

111. The Defence Information Warfare Capability focuses on
six areas, namely: Network Warfare; Electronic Warfare; Psychological Operations; Information-Based Warfare; Information
Infrastructure Warfare; and Command and Control Warfare (Figure 10-6).

112. The focus areas are defined as follows:
a. **Network Warfare (Netwar): To exploit or use**
the information systems (offensive) of an adversary
and to protect all defence information systems (defensive) to ensure use for own forces.
b. **Electronic Warfare: To exploit or use electro-**
magnetic energy to determine, exploit, reduce or
prevent hostile use of the electromagnetic spectrum
while retaining its friendly use.
c. **Psychological Operations: To conduct planned**
psychological activities in peace, conflict and war in
order to create attitudes and behaviour favourable
to the achievement of political and military objectives. These operations include psychological action and warfare activities designed to achieve the
desired psychological effect.


-----

d. **Information-Based Warfare: To enhance situ-**
ational awareness at the operational and tactical levels as well as to degrade that of an adversary.
e. **Information Infrastructure Warfare: To pro-**
tect own information infrastructure and to attack or
exploit an adversary’s information infrastructure.
f. **Command and Control Warfare: To conduct**
Information Warfare on the battlefield by causing
a disjuncture between an adversary’s command
structure and its commanded forces.


look to its own defence, but some countries must
also, in their own interests, look to regional security
and stability. South Africa must be able to undertake
expeditionary operations, be they constabulary or
peace support in nature.
d. **Between ‘high tech’ and ‘low tech’. ‘High**
tech’ is tempting, can give a very real edge over
opponents and can be the most cost-effective option. But ‘high tech’ can also be costly to achieve and
maintain. ‘Low tech’ is tempting because it is in most
cases cheaper, but can prove to be a false economy
if the opposing forces are better equipped. Technology decisions must be taken judiciously on a caseby-case basis.
e. **Between local and foreign equipment. Local**
will give strategic independence, provide equipment optimised for the theatre and for the Defence
Force’s operational style, and can have valuable spinoffs for the wider economy. Local manufacture under licence can also be an option. Key items that will
be manufactured locally include munitions, batteries and spares, secure command and control communications, Information Warfare equipment and
other equipment required in large quantities. Complex equipment that is needed in small quantities is
generally optimally acquired military-off-the-shelf. A
much larger sourcing of materiel from local suppliers
could serve as an impetus to re-industrialisation.
f. **Between current equipment and future**
**technology.** The Defence Force must aquire the
equipment it requires to conduct current operations
and to meet potential short-notice challenges. But
equipment acquisition will be phased to avoid the
problem of block obsolescence facing the Defence
Force at a critical time. Under-equipping and overequipping can be equally dangerous. While sufficient consideration must be given to research and
development, care must be taken to not over-specify requirements in a chase of technology, thereby
detracting from the general principle of acquiring
equipment military-off-the-shelf.
g. **Between preparation for a ‘short’ war or a**
**‘long’ war.** South Africa will ensure adequate reserves of equipment and support for more protracted operations by ensuring the availability of strategic
stocks.
h. **Between preparation for ‘high intensity’**
**and ‘low intensity’ operations. Armies are of-**
ten accused of planning for ‘the last war’ and not
for ‘the war to come’. South Africa will address this
challenge by being prepared for a balance of high
intensity and low intensity operations.
i. **In preparation for probable, possible and**


##### DEFENCE BALANCING PRINCIPLES


113. Defence planning is both a science and an art. It requires
decisions that will affect the defence of the country for decades,
and that involve considerable investment of human, industrial
and financial capital; and those decisions must be based on the
evolving strategic situation, or what threats might arise.

114. There is thus always a real risk that the most carefully considered assessment could be entirely overturned within a short
time by unforeseeable events, such as intervention by an external major power. It is neither possible nor affordable to prepare
for every eventuality. The only practical approach to defence
planning is to maintain balanced capabilities that:
a. Enable the country to meet existing challenges
effectively;
b. Enable the country to deal effectively with foreseeable contingencies;
c. Are flexible and can meet developing challenges or
threats; and that
d. Provide the foundation on which to build stronger
forces when required, within a timeframe that is realistic relative to the strategic situation.

115. The balanced set of capabilities must be continuously
evaluated against the evolving strategic situation, and refocused,
adapted or expanded as the situation dictates. There are ten key
areas in which balance must be maintained:
a. **Among the combat services and the sup-**
**porting services and staff divisions. There is a**
clear need to have the right balance among ground,
naval and air force elements, and to have optimal
balance between ‘teeth’ and ‘tail’. There is often
pressure to improve the ratio of ‘teeth’ to ‘tail’,
which is logical but which also holds the risk of developing forces that cannot sustain operations.
b. **Between Regulars and Reserves. A balance**
of Regulars and Reserves - Regulars to provide the
core and deal with crises, and the Reserves to augment and expand the force when necessary.
c. **Between forces for local and expeditionary**
**operations. Any country must in the first instance**


-----

**‘impossible’ threats. Assuming a particular threat**
to be ‘impossible’ is irresponsibly dangerous. All
contingencies will be identified and then prioritised
by assessing the risk thereof; being a function of the
probability of occurrence and the level of impact
should that occurrence occur.


j. **Between defence expenditure and other**
**government expenditure. An under-funded De-**
fence Force will be disjointed and unable to meet its
constitutional obligations. South Africa will endeavour to find the balance between spending on development and social programmes and national security
imperatives.

## FUTURE MILITARY LEADERS


##### THE MILITARY EDUCATION, TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT IMPERATIVE


###### IMPERATIVES

1. Leadership lies at the centre of organisational excellence.
The importance of exemplary military leadership cannot be
over-emphasised as any failure of the Defence Force in the execution of its mandate has dire and disastrous consequences
for the state. It is for this reason that the Defence Force cannot
compromise on the education, training and development of its
leaders.

2. Military leadership is rooted in the burden of command[1 ]

and there can be no compromise in the development of confident and competent men and women who will be placed in


positions of authority. Throughout human history, military action
has been shaped by the character and competence of those in
command.

3. Leadership is an intangible quality and, ultimately, the effect of the integration of a number of traits within individuals
centred on the “what” the leader should be, know and do. Dynamic, visionary and transformational leadership, underpinned
with knowledge, skill and attitude, is the foundation for future
successful leaders in the Defence Force. To this end, defence
leaders will be subject to intensive education, training and development programmes.

4. Education, training and development, coupled to the
exposure to military complexity over defined periods of time,
is the proven pathway for the development of military leaders with the required character, knowledge, skills and attitudes.
Military professionalism, based upon core military values, ethics
and a robust professional ethos, is the foundations for the future
military leader.


1 Command is the lawful and onerous authority every officer has over men and women in his/her charge by virtue of his/her rank and appointment.


-----

5. Throughout the world, militaries are recognised as key
institutions for the development of leadership within societies.
The leadership foundation inculcated in the young men and
women of both the Regular and Reserve components of the
military will thus profoundly influence society as a whole.

6. The Defence Force, through its leadership development
programmes and the highly trained and disciplined members it
cultivates, contributes significantly to the development of South
Africa’s youth and society as a whole. The military professional
education, training and development of young men and women
will thus make a direct and significant contribution to national
development and the future success of South Africa.

7. The principles contained in this chapter apply equally to
members of both the Regulars and Reserves. It is recognised
however that because of the part-time nature of the service of
the Reserves and their commitment to their civilian careers, flexibility will be required in the implementation of the principles.

###### REQUIREMENT

8. Defence requires an education, training and development
programme, linked to a doctrine regime, to mould its members
into informed, competent and cohesive military professionals for
institutional and operational excellence across the spectrum of
conflict. The guiding principle is that all programmes and courses
will require formal assessment and examination for certification
and graduation.

###### GUIDING DEFENCE PRINCIPLES

9. Ensuring that the Defence Force will strive to be seen as
a representative and trusted non-partisan national asset, the following overarching defence principles are applied to the education, training and development of its members:
a. The Defence Force is subject to sound civil control
and oversight through the Commander-in-Chief,
the Executive and the Legislature.
b. The Defence Force is compliant with national law
and regulations and international law (specifically international humanitarian law).
c. Due consideration and cognisance are given to the
unique nature of the Defence Force relative to the
wider public service.
d. The Defence Force is an agile, balanced, flexible
and technologically advanced force supported by
appropriate science, engineering and technology
capabilities.
e. The Defence Force is to cultivate and maintain a high
standard of military professionalism.
f. Soldiers are skilled, healthy, fit, and highly disciplined


professionals imbued with a high level of morale,
sense of duty and pride in themselves, their capabilities and their equipment.
g. Soldiers are led by exemplary, competent, ethical
and dynamic leaders. Mission command is the foundation of the defence leadership philosophy.
h. The Defence Force is broadly representative of the
people of South Africa, with due consideration being given to matters of equity, including gender and
otherwise enabled persons.

###### EDUCATION, TRAINING AND DEVELOP- MENT PRINCIPLES

10. The following principles are pursued to enhance defence
education, training and development:
a. Notwithstanding the broader development of its
members, defence education, training and development has a primary focus on the defence mandate,
the development of a warrior ethos and the ability to
execute successful combat operations.
b. The defence doctrinal tenet of mission command
will be rigorously pursued. Commanders will be
prepared to take full control of their resources and
will be empowered to make command decisions
within their areas of direct responsibility.
c. Development of defence members is a line function
and therefore a command responsibility throughout
all levels of Defence.
d. The personnel development system is aligned with
the national regulatory framework and consequently
supports later access to alternative civilian careers by
providing portable skills and qualifications for departing defence members.
e. Defence has command over accredited defence
learning institutions, whose education, training and
development practices meet the National Qualifications Framework (NQF) stipulations.
f. Defence presents accredited learning programmes
that satisfy its organisational objectives as well as its
human capital requirements.
g. Education, training and development opportunities
support individual career plans and individual learning pathways.
h. Education, training and development is delivered effectively through tailored infrastructure and sufficient
capacity, and coupled to appropriate methodologies
and delivery systems, such as blended-learning and
e-learning.
i. Individual members take co-responsibility with
the defence organisation for their own continuous
professional education and actively seek access to


-----

education, training
and development
opportunities.
j. The development of
defence personnel is
measured by the value
that development initiatives have added to
individual competence
in the workplace and
by their contribution
to the success of military operations.
k. Distance and e-learning will be emphasised to enable more
Reserve members to
avail themselves of
the opportunity for
empowerment and
development.

###### EFFECTS


_Figure 11-1: Attributes of a Broad-Liberal Education[6]_


11. Defence Force leaders, as members of a global body of
military professionals, are confident, self-assertive and capable of
interacting at both the intellectual and technical levels amongst
their counterparts in Africa and abroad.

12. The defence leadership development programmes provide sufficient capacity to both ensure the requirements of the
Defence Force and make a significant contribution to public sector and private sector leadership through its Reserves.

13. The military education, training and development system
endows officers, warrant officers (WOs) and non-commissioned officers (NCOs), and civilian members with the appropriate knowledge, skills and attitudes to advance the credibility
and professionalism of the Defence Force.


##### APPLIED EDUCATION AND TRAINING CONCEPTS


###### BROAD-LIBERAL EDUCATION CONCEPT

14. Education is directed towards the cognitive development
of individuals to think independently. Thinking requires the
higher order intellectual skills of analysis (dissecting and illuminating concepts), synthesis (combining concepts and generating new ones) and evaluation (establishing criteria and making
judgements)[2].

15. Education is an open knowledge-driven process.[3] A
broad-liberal education[4] is the foundation for the future professional military officer and is thus directed towards the development of personal attributes that apply to life in general (see
Figure 11-1). In the military, educational skills are essential for
the creation and development of military doctrine.[5]

airchronicles/aureview/1985/jan-feb/kline.html Accessed 16 August 2012.

4 A broad-liberal education ascribes to a broad education that empowers individuals with broad knowledge and transferable skills, and cultivates a
strong sense of values, ethics, and civic responsibility. It is more a way of studying than a specific course or field of study. In this instance the curriculum is based on a programme of core military sciences with detailed specialisation in at least one military academic discipline.

and 2 June 1995, pp 5-6.


-----

###### PROFESSIONAL MILITARY EDUCATION CONCEPT

16. Professional military education is the term used to distinguish between the broad-liberal education provided by societal
higher education institutions and that education which is provided and focused on the military. The efficacy of professional
military education depends to a large extent on the quality of the
initial broad-liberal education provided as a foundation. Professional military education is provided by the military in conjunction
with or independently of tertiary institutions of higher learning
and is directed towards specific military professional and occupational-specific knowledge. The spectrum of knowledge that is
addressed during this education is applicable to all aspects and
spheres of the profession of arms.[7]

###### MILITARY TRAINING CONCEPT

17. Military training is rooted in the need for action. It places
the focus on the primary operational functions of the military and
the skills required to do that well.[8] Training is thus directed towards instilling the necessary technical and tactical military skills to
perform effectively. Training is mostly a group-oriented activity
to instil armed forces with an ability ‘to do’. Training constitutes
the foundation of an appropriate military culture and is largely a
closed process for the translation of doctrine into action, inculcation of discipline, and establishment of cohesion. Good training
produces military personnel who respond instinctively to anticipated, recognisable circumstances in a manner circumscribed by
the doctrine and culture to which they have been trained.[9]

###### FOUNDATIONAL MILITARY EDUCATION AND TRAINING CONCEPT

18. Foundational education and training refers to the initial orientation, training, and education of the officer recruits of the Defence Force. It defines the process through which officer recruits
are inducted into the Defence Force and inculcated with the appropriate skills, knowledge and attitudes needed for a career as
a military professional.

19. The future military leader (officers and other ranks) requires a balance between thinking and fighting. This foundational
military development will be rooted in an understanding of the
uniqueness of the military profession and will be done by the
individual Services.


20. The officer career path will in general be rooted in quality tertiary-level broad-liberal education and professional military
training. The WO and NCO career path will be rooted in professional military training, supported by exposure to a wide range
of military experiences, to ensure a skills and mentor-driven approach to leadership by WOs and NCOs. Though a tertiarylevel education is not a prerequisite for WOs and NCOs, it is
nonetheless encouraged.

###### FUNCTIONAL MILITARY DEVELOPMENT CONCEPT

21. Functional military development is linked to the process
of life-long learning and is by and large the responsibility of the
individual through opportunities created by the Defence Force.
This development also relates to the immediate working environment and is normally of an immediate applied practical and
functional nature. Development thus relates to learning activities
that occur outside the formal career-related education and training programmes of the Defence Force.

###### RECRUITMENT CONCEPT

22. Recruitment programmes are rooted in the enhanced status of the Defence Force in society. The military is a practical
profession that balances military adventure with excellent military
education and learning opportunities. It is this combination of
experiences that attracts young men and women to the Defence
Force.

23. Defence recruitment importantly pursues diversified recruitment opportunities throughout society, ranging from geographical recruitment at the grass-roots level to the targeted recruitment of its future leaders. The recruitment of future defence
leaders will occur in a very competitive labour market. Recruitment is broadly representative of the people of South Africa,
with due consideration being given to matters of equity.
a. The Defence Force must have a dedicated decentralised officer recruitment programme based on the
deliberate selection of individuals from schools and
universities with demonstrable leadership qualities
and who meet the academic and professional profile
required of the future military leader.
b. Recruitment of other ranks is broad-based and
spread throughout South Afrcia to ensure that the
breadth of South African society is represented in a

provincially proportionate manner. A balance is ensured between the urban and rural backgrounds of
enlisted recruits.

###### LEADERSHIP CONCEPT

24. All education and training of rank-bearing personnel will
be directed towards the development of leadership attributes
and qualities and is steered towards a culture of decisive, timeous decision-making. The defence doctrinal tenet of mission
command will be instilled.

###### BALANCING CONCEPT FOR EDUCA- TION, TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE

25. Education, training and development will be based on an
understanding of the difference between and the need for both.
Added to this is the requirement to balance the knowledge and
skills so acquired with functional experience and a sound military
ethos (Figure 11-2).

###### LIFE-LONG LEARNING CONCEPT

26. Career progression in the Defence Force will be linked to
the concept of life-long learning. Members will be encouraged
to take personal responsibility for their own learning experiences and career development activities.


###### ACCREDITED LEARN- ING CONCEPT

27. All learning in the career
path of officers, WOs and NCOs
will be accredited within the NQF
and adhere to the requirements
of the South African Qualifications
Authority (SAQA). The Defence
Force will, as far as possible, partner its military professional education with existing programmes at
universities and other institutions
of higher learning and ensure accreditation of its own training
programmes.

###### BOTTOM-UP VS TOP-DOWN LEARN- ING CONCEPT

28. From the bottom-up perspective, foundational officer military education and training will
be delivered through a single,
tailored military institution which
is linked to an established national tertiary institution. From a
top-down perspective, the advanced education and training of
officers, WOs and NCOs will be pursued through access to a
variety of institutions of higher learning, both domestically and
internationally.

###### EDUCATION AND TRAINING PARTNERSHIP CONCEPT

29. Defence forces historically have a strong predisposition
for training and they train on their own very well. Cooperation
and support, however, are required from institutions of higher
learning for the education of military personnel. The Defence
Force will thus ensure an appropriate balance between an inhouse training capacity and the out-sourcing of education to
institutions of higher learning. Partnerships will be established
with recognised institutions of higher learning for both quality
education and training in the Defence Force.

###### JOINT AND SERVICE-UNIQUE EDUCATION, TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT CONCEPT

30. Foundational education, training and development is directed towards military professionalism and the preparation of
military personnel for a career in the armed forces. Joint and
service-unique requirements will be balanced in the education,


-----

functional and warfighting skills. The training domain must be responsive to and able to
adapt to new doctrinal
realities.

32. The interplay between these
domains will be coordinated by the
operations, doctrine and training
staffs of the Chief of the Defence
Force.

##### GROWING FUTURE OFFICERS

satellite training.

###### PROFESSIONAL SKILLS REQUIRED OF THE OFFICER CORPS

36. The Officer Corps
must first and foremost be
military professionals, and
must receive the focused
education, training, service
development and experience
that will enable effective and
efficient functionality in various leadership positions. The
officer must be provided with
the opportunity and the abil

ity to expand and hone professional skills throughout the officer’s career.

37. Career paths must be planned to deliberately endow officers with the correct education, training and service experience necessary to be able to command at all levels, inclusive of
international security structures.

38. The fundamentals of soldiering and officership, military administration and military law must be taught as part of basic officer training and foundational education. An officer must attend
foundational training and education coupled to the functional
and battle-handling training of the particular corps. Such series
will comprise:
a. Officer Foundational Education and Training.
b. Junior Command, Warfare and Staff Course.
c. Senior Command, Warfare and Staff Course.
d. Joint Strategic Studies Course.

###### TRAINING, EDUCATION AND EXPERI- ENCE REQUIRED OF THE OFFICER

39. In order for an officer to progress to senior appointment
in the Defence Force a broad understanding of the various elements of own service and the other services, and a wider insight
into the military profession as a whole, are required. Education
and training will provide only a part of that. The remainder must
come from balanced experience gained throughout his/her career, covering, as an illustrative example:


_�������������������������������������������������_


-----

a. Basic military leadership.[11]

b. Command at the sub-unit, unit and formation level.
c. Operational staff assignments at unit, formation and
headquarters levels.
d. Training and education duties at unit, corps school
and Service level.
e. Appointments to posts in joint structures.
f. Attachments to foreign armed forces, including
course attendance and attaché duty.
g. Postings at various levels in international/multilateral
forces.

40. The career planning system must ensure that officers obtain sufficient broad experience and specialisation before the
rank of colonel/naval captain.

###### FURTHER EDUCATION AND TRAINING OF OFFICERS

41. Officers are encouraged to read for post-graduate or
post-diploma qualifications and contribute to professional journals. Officers should be in possession of a post-graduate or postdiploma qualification for appointment as general or flag officers.

###### OFFICER CAREER PATH

42. The officer career path will broadly adhere to the following
broad trajectory (see Figure 11-4):
a. Pre-commissioned, foundational education, training
and development is provided by the Services at the
Defence Academy. The Defence Academy must ensure the inculcation of an appropriate level of military
knowledge and skills and the moulding of a culture of
military professionalism.
b. Failure to achieve either the required academic or
training standards will disqualify the individual from
the cadet programme. Further utilisation in the Defence Force will be determined on a case-by-case
basis.
c. After the junior officer’s commissioning, functional
and corps schools will provide Service-specific training at functional, corps and Service-specific training
institutions to ensure functional alignment for initial
tactical employment.
d. Service-specific Command and Staff Training at the
Service Colleges for command and staff appointment at the tactical, higher tactical and operational
levels.
e. Junior and Senior Joint Warfare Courses at the War
College.
f. Command and Staff Course at the War College

11 Platoon level.


in preparation for appointment at joint operational
command and staff positions.
g. Security and Defence Studies Programme at the
Defence College in preparation of general or flag
level officers for high command and strategic staff
positions.


##### GROWING FUTURE WOs AND NCOs


###### DEVELOPMENT OF THE WO AND NCO CORPS

43. Future operational success remains critically dependent on
the quality and calibre of the future soldier – and the development of responsible, value-driven and disciplined soldiers. The
Defence Force recruitment system will be devolved to Services
and pursued on a decentralised basis. The future soldier will be
a skilled, healthy, fit, and highly disciplined military professional imbued with a high level of morale and sense of duty. The
Defence Force will be an equitable, broadly representative and
gender-aligned national asset. A through-life assessment and selection system will be established to inform merit-based career
advancement for all soldiers, coupled to education, training and
development achievement.

44. The WO Corps forms the ‘backbone’ while the NCO
Corps forms the ‘skeleton’ of the Defence Force. It is these bodies of tough and experienced WOs and NCOs who train soldiers, airmen and sailors and provide their officers with combatready soldiers with which to execute missions. WOs also ensure
that forces remain functioning during combat. This includes the
planning for and execution of echelons during combat.

###### PROFESSIONAL SKILLS REQUIRED OF THE WO AND NCO CORPS

45. The value of the WO and NCO arises from the experience built up over many years of service. WOs and senior
NCOs have more experience than most junior officers with
whom they will work. Senior NCO skills are developed over
time and are founded in practical application. It is this body of
experience that makes the senior WO or NCO an invaluable
asset to the Defence Force.

46. The technical specialists of the WO and NCO Corps carry the responsibility for ensuring that the assigned equipment
is properly maintained and serviceable for use when required,
while the administrative specialists carry the responsibility for the
effective and efficient running of the unit, and particularly for ensuring that the personnel, logistic and financial systems are implemented correctly and function effectively.


-----

47. The combat WO and NCO Corps are in many respects
the military craftsmen, skilled in the craft of individual and smallgroup combat tactics, in leadership and in the combat aspects of
the particular branch of the Service. The WO and NCO Corps
must receive the focused education, training and service experience that will enable them to function effectively and efficiently
in various posts and to expand and hone skills throughout the
course of their career.

48. WO and NCO Corps education, training and service experience must be planned to provide:
a. An outstanding understanding of people under
stress, the skills to lead and manage them and the
ability to instil discipline based on mutual respect.
b. The ability to teach, train and enthuse trainees.
c. The basic skills of soldiering, a thorough understanding of the relevant weapons and equipment and
their maintenance, and the ability to use them to
optimal effect.
d. A sound grasp of battle drills, and the ability to execute them under conditions of extreme stress.
e. The tact to work effectively and cordially with junior officers who are often far less experienced but
nonetheless bear command seniority.

49. The fundamentals of soldiering, military leadership and administration must be taught as part of WO and NCO training.
WOs and NCOs must attend a series of courses, coupled to
the functional and warfare training of the particular corps. Such
series will comprise:

_Figure 11-5: Broad WO and NCO Career Development Path_


a. NCO Formative Training and Development.
b. Senior NCO Course.
c. WO Supervisors Course.
d. Joint WOs Course.

###### TRAINING, EDUCATION AND EXPERIENCE REQUIRED OF THE WO AND NCO CORPS

50. Although courses convey specific skills, good WOs and
NCOs are primarily created by service experience that imbues
knowledge, wisdom and judgement. The WO and NCO career planning system must ensure that their career progression
allows for the widest possible experience at every level of appointment. WOs and NCOs are required to spend sufficient
time in each rank group in order to develop a depth of experience. This exposure may extend to:
a. Soldiering in the smallest element of the branch of
the Service.
b. A junior leader.
c. An instructor on corps and service training.
d. A specialist or supervisory instructor.
e. A senior NCO.
f. A WO who directly supports his/her commander at
different levels.

51. In order for a WO to progress to appointments at formation and higher level in the Defence Force, a general understanding of the various elements of own Service and the other
Services, and a wider insight into the military profession as a
whole, is required. Education
and training will provide only
a part of that. The remainder
must come from balanced
experience gained throughout his/her career, covering (merely as an illustrative
example):
a. Basic military
leadership.
b. Supervision and
monitoring at the
sub-unit, unit and
formation level.
c. Operational
assignments at
unit, formation
and headquarters
levels.
d. Training and education duties at
unit, corps school
and Service level.


-----

e. Appointments to posts in joint structures.
f. Attachments to foreign armed forces, including
course attendance and attaché assistant duty.

###### WO AND NCO FURTHER EDUCATION AND TRAINING

52. In addition to the courses that WOs and NCOs are required to undergo during their career, they will also be afforded
the opportunity to further their military and general education.
Increasingly, NCOs and WOs will be required to study for
B Tech degrees in their areas of technical specialisation.

53. NCOs should be required to read for a one-year certificate prior to promotion to a senior NCO appointment.

54. Senior NCOs should be required to read for at least a
two-year certificate/diploma prior to promotion to a WO
appointment.

55. WOs should be required to read for a tertiary qualification
prior to promotion to a senior WO at formation level and higher.

###### WO AND NCO CAREER PATH

56. The Defence Force will develop and implement a career
path for WOs and NCOs. The foundation of this career path
must be a rank structure that provides sufficient rank levels, equal
to the eleven levels in the officer career path, and visible progression accompanying performance and seniority that ensures a
satisfying career.

57. The WO and NCO career path must adhere to the following broad trajectory (see Figure 11-5):
a. As a general rule, the appointment of NCOs will occur from the ranks.
b. Pre-appointment foundational training at the corps
schools will ensure the inculcation of an appropriate
level of military knowledge and skills and a culture of
military professionalism.
c. Post-appointment, Services will provide Service-specific training at functional, corps and Service-specific
training institutions to ensure functional alignment for
tactical employment.
d. Service-specific training at the Service colleges for
appointment and employment at the tactical, higher
tactical and operational levels.
e. Training at the Warrant Officers Academy in preparation for appointment at the joint operational levels.


##### GROWING FUTURE DEFENCE CIVILIANS


###### DEVELOPMENT OF CIVILIANS

58. Defence civilians, as a component of the ‘one-force’, provide professional, specialist, managerial and functional support
within the Defence Force, the Defence Secretariat and the Ministry of Defence. Development of the civilians in defence remains critical to the functionality of the defence organisation.

59. Attention will be given to the development of a competent civilian component at all levels in defence. Civilian education, training and development programmes will be tailored to
integrate with domestic and foreign learning opportunities. Particular focus will be given to the high-level analytical and strategic
competencies required of defence personnel serving in the Defence Secretariat. A merit-based career advancement system will
be established, coupled to education, training and development
achievement.

60. Defence civilians must attend education, training and development programmes to acquire the required competencies
and outcomes. Civilian incumbents must comply with the required competencies for their specific post and post level. The
following aspects of civilian development are emphasised:
a. **Recruitment. Apart from the current practice**
of recruiting the civilian component from outside
the defence organisation, consideration must also
be given to recruiting military members no longer
wishing to pursue a military career into the civilian
component.
b. **Integrated Approach. Defence shall ensure that**
education and training programmes are aligned with
the integrated development programmes as recommended by the Defence Service Commission.
c. **Induction/Orientation Programme. It is com-**
pulsory for all defence civilians, including interns,
to attend organisational and functional induction
programmes.
d. **Same Applicable and Appropriate Pro-**
**grammes for Civilians and Military Members.**
The same applicable and appropriate education,
training and development programmes for civilians
and military members will support the defence personnel strategy. This aims at minimising duplication
of learning programmes and ensuring mutual understanding. Examples are leadership development and
civic education.


-----

_Figure 11-6: Education and Training Pathways_

e. **Learning Path for Defence Civilians. A learn-**
ing path must be developed for civilians and be
based on a coherent competency framework that
guides Services and Divisions in identifying functional and developmental education, training and
development for civilians. The compulsory and recommended education, training and development
must be linked to the specific requirements of the
organisation and the profile requirements of the
employee.
61. Attention will be given to the development of civilian competencies at all levels (administrative, junior, middle and senior
management) and education, training and development programmes will be tailored to integrate with domestic and foreign
learning opportunities.


##### DEFENCE EDUCATION AND TRAINING APPROACH


###### THE DEFENCE EDUCATION AND TRAIN- ING PHILOSOPHY

62. The following underpinning defence education and training
philosophy provides a holistic approach for military professional
education and training, starting from foundational education and


training and progressing up to
the level of advanced national
security studies. Due cognisance is given to the alignment
of Defence Force operational
requirements with corresponding academic qualification levels.
This holistic approach honours
the ‘one-force’ concept and
provides education, training and
development systems for the
Regulars, Reserves and defence
civilians as depicted in Figure
11-6. An auxiliary service will
have its own specific education, training and development
requirements.

63. The defence training
system is structured to deliver
within the broad milestones
reflected below and is provided
by the following organisational
groupings and capabilities.

###### FOUNDATIONAL MILITARY EDUCATION AND TRAINING

64. Services will provide foundational military training for all
soldiers. The Defence Academy, as the officer commissioning
authority, will provide the foundational education to officer cadets and candidate officers to enable their commissioning as junior officers in the Defence Force.

###### PROFESSIONAL MILITARY EDUCATION AND TRAINING

65. Services, as the military competency authorities, provide
the colleges and schools that deliver the following accredited
programmes:
a. **Formative** **Non–Commissioned** **Training.**
Formative training, which includes induction training
and current basic military training, must be presented by the Services to inculcate both the common/
joint military culture and the Service-specific culture.
(Period from entry to WO).
b. **Services Junior Training and Functional**
**Training. This training is the responsibility of the**
Services (as military competency authorities) as well
as Services and Divisions (as functional competency


-----

authorities) and is structured to render deployable
soldiers. The focus is on providing appropriate professional military education and training. (Period from
lieutenant/corporal to captain/staff sergeant.)
c. **Joint Warfare Training. The principle of joint**
warfare and battle handling training at all levels is emphasised. To this end, joint warfare training will be
presented at both the junior officer and senior officer
level and from the NCO up to senior WO level. At
the junior levels, the principles of joint warfare will
be taught in order to prepare the defence member
for joint higher warfare training.
d. **Services Senior Command & Staff and Func-**
**tional Training. This training is the responsibility of**
the Services and must provide sufficient professional
military education and training for entry into senior
service and the joint, interagency, interdepartmental
and multinational operational environment. (Period
from majors/WOs to lieutenant colonels.)
e. **Force Training. This training is the responsibility of**
the Services and provides combat-ready capabilities.
The Operations Headquarters, at the operational
level, will provide mission-ready training for the application of combat-ready capabilities at the different
levels of operational and tactical deployments.

###### FUNCTION-ORIENTATED EDUCATION AND TRAINING

66. Services and Divisions, as the functional competency authorities, provide and/or coordinate accredited function-orientated education and training as follows:
a. **Functional Training and Academic Integra-**
**tion. The further training and development, up to**
the Services’ senior phase, together with all levels
of functional training will be integrated with undergraduate studies at universities and universities of
technology, or vocational studies from NQF level 5
to 6 at further education and training colleges.
i. Services will be responsible for ensuring that
their members receive vocation-orientated
tertiary education specific to their Service or
Division requirements.
ii. Such education may be provided by a combination of in-house and external tertiary educational institutions contracted to the Defence
Force.
iii. Specialist education, which may include medical, engineering and other advanced fields, is
to be provided by external tertiary educational
institutions contracted to the Defence Force.
b. **Foreign Learning and Exposure. Foreign learn-**
ing opportunities and exposure through international


placements will be actively pursued for officers and
WOs to address defence diplomacy, increase understanding of international military practice, and
enhance the professional profile of senior NCOs,
WOs and officers.
c. **Exit Education Training and Development.**
This training is the responsibility of the individual in
alignment with career planning and will be executed
on a continuous basis to ensure that defence members are able to successfully reintegrate into civilian
careers, after leaving the Defence Force.

###### JOINT EDUCATION, TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT

67. **Operations, Doctrine and Training. The operations,**
doctrine and training staffs of the Chief of the Defence Force will
ensure:
a. Joint defence education, training and doctrine
integrity.
b. Training institutions and programmes.

68. **The Warrant Officers Academy. The Warrant Of-**
ficers Academy provides the education and training of WOs in
preparation for appointment at the joint operational and strategic
levels.

69. **The College of Educational Technology (COLET).**
The COLET provides:
a. The development of Occupation-Directed Education, Training and Development Practitioners (OD
ETDPs). The instructors, directing staff, facilitators,
lecturers and other ETD practitioners (training managers, instructional designers, learning material developers, researchers, and evaluators) must firstly
be functionally qualified, military-professionally educated and trained at appropriate levels before being developed in the skills required to be accredited
educators and trainers.
b. The professional training to be competent to apply
the knowledge, skills and systems as proposed by
the applied science of educational technology. This
is of fundamental importance in the provisioning of
education, training and development in the national
education, training and development landscape as
contextualised for the military.
c. Research and development into training methodologies and technologies and the integration thereof into
the education and training institutions and providers.

70. **The War College. The War College provides the fol-**
lowing accredited programmes:
a. **Joint Senior Command and Staff Education**


-----

**and Training. This education and training which**
addresses security studies, warfare studies at the
joint and multinational operational level and corporate management for officers will be provided by
the Joint Training Command. Academic integration
takes place at the post-graduate/honours degree
level.
b. **Foreign Learning Opportunities.** These programmes will be established and the War College
will invest in a vibrant exchange programme of students and directing staff with foreign military institutions of higher learning.
c. **Course Accreditation. Service agreements will**
be established with selected institutions of higher
learning to ensure accreditation of the programme
at the honours-degree level (NQF-level 8).

71. The Defence College.
a. The Defence College will be the capstone institution for higher learning in the Defence Force. Its
programme and products will reflect the quality of
South African strategic thinking. Strategic leadership
and diplomacy will be integrated at this level.
b. The Defence College will provide an advanced
strategic studies programme to prepare officers for
supreme command and strategic-level staff work.
Graduates will be conversant with the nature of
South African political and defence policy and military strategies, and competent to analyse them.
c. Consequently the Defence College will provide the
Security and Defence Studies Programme.
d. Service agreements will be established with selected institutions of higher learning to ensure integration of the programme at the masters-degree level
(NQF-level 9).

72. **Peace Mission Training Centre (PMTC). The**
PMTC provides specialist, globally accessible, full-time and
distance-learning courses and programmes on peace support,
humanitarian relief, and security operations to military personnel, police, and civilians working together in peace missions.


##### THE FUTURE DEFENCE ACADEMY


###### THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE SOUTH AFRICAN DEFENCE ACADEMY

73. A Defence Academy must be established to provide
foundational education, training and development to all officers
of the Defence Force. It must have sufficient inherent capacity
to ensure the Defence Force officer requirements for both the
Regulars and Reserves are met.


###### PROGRAMMES OF THE DEFENCE ACADEMY

74. The Defence Academy must be the Defence Force’s officer commissioning authority and provide the following fully accredited programmes.
a. **Officer Cadet Programme. Handpicked and**
stringently selected high-quality recruits attend the
Defence Academy for a broad-liberal education (diploma or degree), further military training and officer formative training over a four-year period until
officer commissioning. The military training component of the programme will be presented by Service
instructors assigned to the Defence Academy.
b. **Candidate Officer Programme. Regular and**
Reserve graduate recruits, specialists and late entry
NCOs are provided with further military training and
officer formative training for officer commissioning.
The military training component of the programme
will be presented by Service instructors assigned to
the Defence Academy. The post-graduate Diploma
in Military Studies may be pursued on a full-time basis or by distance and satellite learning.
c. **University Reserve Training Programme.**
The Defence Academy, in conjunction with the Services, will be responsible for the University Reserve
Training Programme in which tertiary undergraduates are provided with foundation military training,
officer formative training and officer commissioning
whilst studying at own expense at tertiary institutions
throughout the country. Whilst the programme is
primarily aimed at the military training of Reserves,
successful completion enables commissioning at
graduation and appointment to either the Regular
or Reserve component of the Defence Force.
d. **Post-Graduate Military Studies. Officers are**
provided with post-graduate military studies through
a Faculty of Military Science to study for honours,
masters and doctorate degrees (or post-diploma
equivalents) during their period in service.

###### BASIC TENETS OF THE DEFENCE   ACADEMY

75. The Defence Academy must be, at all times, a symbol of
military professionalism and leadership excellence, and a reflection of civil-military relations in South Africa. Education, training
and development is presented in a complementary manner that
ensures appropriate levels of knowledge and skills as well as the
development of an appropriate military ethos.

76. The focus of the education, training and development
programmes at the Defence Academy must be on the enhance

-----

_Figure 11-7: Defence Academy Organisation_

ment of leadership potential and a military culture that enhances
the professional ethos of the Defence Force.

77. The Services are responsible for foundational military training prior to entry to the Defence Academy, further military training during the four-year programme, and Service-specific training
during the last six months at the Defence Academy. This training
prepares members for appointment to their respective Services.

###### FUNCTIONAL PRINCIPLES OF THE DEFENCE ACADEMY

78. The Defence Academy must allow for:
a. The cognisance of the fundamental difference between academic education and military training but
the equal importance of both.
b. The need for education, training and development as
the basis of military professionalism and officership.
c. The recognition of the military as the training authority and the university as the education authority.
d. A clear line between the academic apparatus and
military apparatus of the Defence Academy in or

der to optimise each
domain according to its
ethos.

###### DEFENCE ACADEMY ORGANISATION

79. The following structuring principles are provided (Figure 11-7):
a. The Defence Academy
will be in the commandline of the Chief of the
Defence Force.
b. The Commandant of
the Defence Academy
will be a senior officer of
either General or Flag
rank, being a retired
Service Chief or other
senior officer from the
combat disciplines.
c. The Commandant will
command the Defence
Academy.
d. The Dean of the Faculty of Military Science
is a university academic
appointment and is responsible for the education programmes of the
Defence Academy.
e. The Support Branch will be responsible for all the
financial, logistical and personnel support functions at
the Defence Academy.
f. The Training Branch will be responsible for military
training, officer formative training and the coordination of the Service-specific training of candidate officers and cadets at the Defence Academy.
g. The Doctrine Branch will be responsible for the
teaching of defence doctrine and will liaise with the
Centre for Military Studies and Faculty of Military Science for purposes of research and development.
h. The Education Branch will be responsible for the

recreational programmes at the Defence Academy.
j. Consideration can be given to placing the Defence
Force Sports Science Centre of Excellence at the
Defence Academy, with a further mandate, in part

-----

nership with Sport and Recreation South African
(SRSA), to provide sport development assistance to
South African youth.

###### Faculty of Military Science

80. The Faculty of Military Science will be responsible for the
education of officers at the Defence Academy. The Faculty of
Military Science will be a fully-fledged self-standing academic faculty of a university.

81. The academic staff of the Faculty of Military Science will
promote academic freedom and as such be employed by the
university.  Nonetheless, the relationship between the university and the Defence Force will allow for the secondment of
defence personnel to the Faculty of Military Science in order
to complete post-graduate studies whilst also teaching in the
Faculty of Military Science. The university will be encouraged to
make use of retired senior defence personnel with the appropriate academic qualifications in the Faculty of Military Science in
order to capture relevant military experience towards the education of the future officers of the Defence Force.

82. The Faculty of Military Science must have internationally
recognised scholars as its teachers and researchers. Fulltime
permanent staff members will be supplemented on an ad hoc
basis by visiting scholars from other universities as guest lecturers and visiting fellows.

###### Centre for Military Studies (CEMIS)

83. The Centre for Military Studies[12] must function as a research centre of the university within the Faculty of Military
Science and the Director must report directly to the Dean of
Military Science. The research ethos of CEMIS is based on the
following values: being research driven, upholding integrity in
research, maintaining high ethical standards, intellectual independence and professional, accountable and responsible spending of funds, best-practice deliverables and their widest possible
dissemination.

84. The research programme of the Centre for Military Studies must focus on contemporary security, military and civilmilitary issues and will cooperate with the Doctrine Branch of
the Defence Academy to provide the Defence Force with a
research and development capability. The Centre for Military
Studies will, as far as possible, be policy-relevant and support
the Defence Force with independent scholarly research.[13] The
Defence Force will second personnel with the appropriate ac

ademic qualifications as research associates to the Centre for
Military Studies for this purpose.

85. The research output of the Centre for Military Studies
must adhere to the requirements for research at the university, international academic citizenship and best practice and as
such will be published and distributed through academic and
scholarly journals and the available digital media.[14] CEMIS, as a
multi- and interdisciplinary research-driven platform, must focus strongly on research excellence and cooperation with national/international research associations/institutions/academic
stakeholders, in both production and dissemination of research
outputs/deliverables.

###### Defence Academy Advisory Committee

86. A Defence Academy Advisory Committee (DAAC) consisting of military experts and academics from other universities
must be established as an advisory body to the university and
the Defence Force on the content of the degree and diploma
programmes in order to ensure a world-class education for officers of the Defence Force.

###### Relationship between the Dean of Military Science and the Commander of the Education Branch

87. The Dean of the Faculty of Military Science must be appointed by the university to manage the teaching, research and
community interaction of the Faculty of Military Science as a faculty of the university.

88. The Commander of the Education Branch must be appointed by the Defence Force and will be responsible for:
a. Coordination, discipline and command and control
over the candidate officers and cadets during the
education timeframes.
b. Consolidation and articulation of the educational requirements of the Defence Force.
c. Liaison with and coordination of the programme
of the Defence Academy with the Dean of Military
Science.

###### THE DEFENCE ACADEMY CURRICULUM

89. All activities at the Defence Academy must be directed
towards:
a. The development of the leadership potential and
qualities of all future officers.


12 Established in the 1990s under the aegis of both the University of Stellenbosch and the SANDF.

13 Open and transparent research.

decision-making.
c. Character development and the
inculcation of an
appropriate military culture.
d. An understanding
of the military’s
obligation to be

###### Non-Core Curriculum

96. The focus of the Faculty of Military Science must be interdisciplinary and directly related to the military sciences. The
Faculty of Military Science will therefore primarily be responsible
for the core programme. Any additional non-military science
curricula should be delivered by the other faculties of the affiliated university that specialise in those subjects.

###### Officer Cadet Programme

97. The cadet programme at the Defence Academy will be a
four-year programme. Successful completion of the education,
training and development programme by cadets at the Defence
Academy will culminate in the award of an officer commission
from the Defence Force and a Bachelor Degree in Military Science from the university.

###### Candidate Officer Programme

98. The candidate officer programme at the Defence Academy will be a one-year post-graduate programme. Successful
completion of the education, training and development programme by candidate officers will culminate in the award of an
officer commission from the Defence Force and a Diploma in
Military Science from the university. The Diploma in Military Science will be a stand-alone full rounded academic diploma on
offer to candidate officers. The candidate officer programme
will be designed for the following categories of recruits:
a. Recruits who are earmarked for commissioning and
who are in possession of a tertiary qualification from
a recognised institution of higher learning.
b. Specialists appointed to provide the Defence Force
with specific professional skills such as doctors, lawyers, clergy and engineers.
c. Reserve candidate officers with tertiary qualifications
who did not participate in the University Reserve
Training Programme.
d. NCOs and WOs from the ranks, with preferably
more than ten years of military service, and who are
earmarked for officer appointment.
e. Specific categories of defence civilian employees.


###### GRADUATION AND COMMISSIONING OF OFFICERS

99. On successful completion of studies, the officer cadets will
be commissioned and awarded with either a Bachelor Degree
in Military Science or Diploma in Military Sciences from the
university.


100. Complementary to the above, all defence members must
be exposed to a career-long robust civic education programme.
Civic education is regarded as the process in which taught values
are translated into lived values.  The aim and purpose of the
civic education programme are to instil respect amongst military
personnel and civilian members of Defence for the core values
of a democratic South Africa through appropriate education and
training. These values derive principally from the Constitution.
They include respect for human rights, the rights and duties of
soldiers, the rule of law, international law, non-partisanship,
non-discrimination and civil supremacy over the armed forces.

101. This programme must consist of and cover at least the
following aspects:
a. **Subjects Covered. The key features of: the dem-**
ocratic political process; the South African Constitution; the Bill of Rights; civil-military relations in a democracy; International Humanitarian Law (the Law
of Armed Conflict); the defence corporate value
system and military professionalism in a democracy.
b. **Target Group. The civic education programme**
will extend to all defence personnel, both for uniformed and civilian members, but will necessarily
be tailored according to function and rank. It must
cover all the levels of military professional education
and training for officers, WOs and NCOs, as well as
for defence civilians. Applicable subjects must also
extend to all levels of combat- and mission-readiness training.
c. **Contextualisation of Civic Education.** The
civic education programme will be integrated into
all aspects of education and training rather than being treated as an isolated subject. It will be applied
in the military and defence civilian contexts through
lectures, simulated exercises, combat-/missionreadiness training exercise scenarios and case studies, as applicable. The civic education programme
does not replace military or civilian disciplinary processes or procedures. The defence institutional culture will be imbued with respect for human rights
and the rule of law only if its members are subject
to disciplinary action in the event of transgression.

## MILITARY DISCIPLINE


##### MILITARY DISCIPLINARY SYSTEM AND RELATED MEASURES


###### REQUIREMENT FOR MILITARY DISCIPLINE AND RELATED MEASURES

1. A revised and cohesive military disciplinary system, a minor corrective measures system and concomitant administrative
measures are required to meet the constitutional imperative
that “the defence force must be structured and managed as a
disciplined military force”.[1]

2. The current military disciplinary system was developed
within the constitutional framework to assert norms applicable
to military judicial processes. The current system of military justice is thus based mainly on the Military Discipline Supplementary Measures Act (Act No 16 of 1999) as read with its Rules of
Procedure and the First Schedule of the Defence Act (Act No 44
of 1957).

1 Constitution, 1996, Section 200(1).


3. However, challenges arising from the application of the
Military Discipline Supplementary Measures Act and limited
training thereon have led to perceptions that military discipline has been compromised and the authority of commanders eroded. The current system has specifically disempowered
commanders by removing the summary discipline system away
from the commander to the military courts.

4. Certain challenges, shortcomings and opportunities for
improvement have been identified and are being addressed
through the development of a draft Military Discipline Bill
(MDB).

###### MILITARY DISCIPLINE

5. An effective soldier is proud, tough and disciplined, and
displays morale, cohesion, trust, shared soldiering values and
high standards of military conduct at all times. Soldiers, in joining
the military, agree to accept the lawful direction of those placed
in authority over them. Soldiers train for the application of lethal
force under conditions of conflict and in so doing accept the


-----

risk of death or serious injury in the execution of orders. Military discipline is that mental attitude and state of training which
renders military obedience instinctive under all conditions and,
if necessary, for soldiers to engage in major combat operations
to defend and protect South Africa and its people – even to the
forfeiture of one’s own life. It is this function that distinguishes the
Defence Force from other government departments and from
all other sections of our society.

6. Sound military discipline is the cornerstone of a professional and functional defence force. It is founded upon respect
for, and loyalty to, properly constituted authority. It is achieved
through rigorous training that develops self-control, character
and efficiency. Such training implies subjection to control exerted
for the good of the group. Justice Kriegler of the South African
Constitutional Court clearly spells out the requirement for military discipline in his judgment on the Minister of Defence vs Potsane and Another, and concurred with by Justices Chaskalson,
Langa, Ackermann, Madala, Mokgoro, O’Regan, Sachs, Yacoob,
Du Plessis and Skweyiya:[2]

_“The ultimate objective of the military in time of peace is to_
_prepare for war to support the policies of the civil government._
_The military organization ... requires, as no other system, the_
_highest standard of discipline [which] can be defined as an_
_attitude of respect for authority that is developed by leader-_
_ship, precept and training. It is a state of mind which leads_
_to a willingness to obey an order no matter how unpleas-_
_ant the task to be performed. This is not the characteristic_
_of the civilian community. It is the ultimate characteristic of_
_the military organization. It is the responsibility of those who_
_command to instil discipline in those who they command. In_
_doing so there must be the correction and the punishment of_
_individuals.[3]_

_Modern soldiers in a democracy, those contemplated by_
_chapter 11 of the Constitution, are not mindless automa-_
_tons. Ideally they are to be thinking men and women imbued_
_with the values of the Constitution; and they are to be disci-_
_plined. Such discipline is built on reciprocal trust between the_
_leader and the led. The commander needs to know and trust_
_the ability and willingness of the troops to obey. They in turn_
_should have confidence in the judgment and integrity of the_
_commander to give wise orders. This willingness to obey or-_
_ders and the concomitant trust in such orders are essential to_
_effective discipline. At the same time discipline aims to devel-_


_op reciprocal trust horizontally, between comrades. Soldiers_
_are taught and trained to think collectively and act jointly, the_
_cohesive force being military discipline built on trust, obedi-_
_ence, loyalty,_ esprit de corps and camaraderie. Discipline
_requires that breaches be nipped in the bud – demonstrably,_
_appropriately and fairly.[4]_

_The most common form of disciplinary proceeding against a_
_soldier is a summary and relatively informal appearance be-_
_fore the commanding officer of his or her unit. This swift and_
_purely internal disciplinary procedure is retained in the Act,_
_which also creates courts of first instance staffed by military_
_judges with more extensive punitive jurisdiction.[5]_

_For a civilian prosecutor, even one attached to the particular_
_military unit but not forming part of the command structure,_
_to have to take [such] decisions would be unfair to both the_
_prosecutor and the accused. For such decisions to have to_
_be debated at a more senior level by or with the officials of_
_the NDPP, who have no knowledge of and little feel for the lo-_
_cal circumstances would be even more problematic. In either_
_event the effect on military lines of authority and command_
_would be potentially disastrous.”[6]_

7. The effectiveness of a military organisation is inextricably
linked to the concepts of command, leadership and discipline.
In essence, military discipline is that state of good military order
which should exist in a military command. A lack of discipline
compromises the effectiveness of the Defence Force and renders it unable to perform its constitutional mandate of defending
and protecting South Africa and its people. It is this good order
that allows all members of a military command to act together
as a cohesive fighting force. Deviation from this state of good
military order is dealt with within uniquely military disciplinary
and corrective measures systems. It is the responsibility of those
who command to instil discipline in those who they command.
In doing so there must be the correction and punishment of
individuals.

8. Disciplinary or corrective action may be taken against a defence member who fails to meet or uphold the military standard
of conduct. This is entirely consistent with the military doctrine
of ‘mission command’ whereby commanders fully control their
resources and are empowered to make command decisions
within their areas of direct competence.


2 Minister of Defence v Potsane and Another; Legal Soldier (Pty) Ltd and Others v Minister of Defence and Others 2002 (1) SA 1 (CC).

3 _Ibid, par 39._

4 _Ibid, par 39._

5 _Ibid, par 40._

6 _Ibid, par 41._


-----

9. The broader concept of military discipline should be distinguished from military disciplinary measures, (minor) corrective measures and the prosecution of criminal offences committed by persons subject to the Military Disciplinary Code.
a. In the first instance, military discipline is not about
punishing crime or maintaining and promoting law,
order and tranquillity in society, but about ensuring
an effective military force capable and ready to protect the territorial integrity of the country and the
freedom of its people[7].
b. In the **second instance, the military disciplinary**
system exists to uphold good military order and discipline using statutory powers to:
i. Deal with minor infringements summarily and
apply minor sanctions through a disciplinary
hearing.
ii. Address more serious contraventions in a formal manner through a court martial.
iii. Provide for extra-territorial jurisdiction when
defence members subject to the military disciplinary system are deployed outside the borders of the Republic.
c. In the third instance, minor corrective interventions are measures that the commanding officer
may routinely pursue to address shortcomings that
may from time to time arise regarding the personal
and professional performance of a military member.
Corrective measures are regimental interventions
that embed military standards, correct errant behaviour or adjust behaviour inconsistent with military
norms.
d. In the fourth instance, military offences must be
distinguished from criminal offences. Certain criminal offences committed by members outside the
borders of the Republic during deployments are
dealt with by military courts in accordance with the
extra-territoriality jurisdictional principle. There are,
however, certain criminal offences which, if committed inside the borders of the Republic, are dealt with
by civil courts.

###### MINOR CORRECTIVE MEASURES SYSTEM

10. Purpose. The fundamental purpose of the minor corrective measures system is to:
a. Provide commanders at all levels with a swift and
formally regulated way of dealing with minor failings
or defaults related to standards and performances.
b. Foster, promote and uphold the requisite discipline

7 _Ibid, par 38_


and behaviour for the maintenance of operational
effectiveness.

11. Terms and Principles. The following terms and principles are confirmed:
a. **Minor Corrective Measures.**
i. Officers commanding or superior officers, using their command authority[8], may implement
against any direct subordinate, minor corrective measures to rehabilitate, censure conduct
or correct minor professional or personal failings and defaults in order to achieve, restore
and maintain operational effectiveness and
efficiency.
ii. Specific corrective actions may be applied
to contribute towards the achieving and
maintaining of operational effectiveness and
efficiency.
iii. Corrective measures are inappropriate to address the following:
(1) Criminal transgressions.
(2) Habitual repetition of minor
transgressions.
b. **The Minor Corrective Process. The minor cor-**
rective process shall involve the following: observation, reporting or informal investigation, recording
and carrying out of appropriate action.

12. Authority. The authority for the administration of minor
corrective measures is derived from the command authority
of commanders at all levels, according to powers appropriate
to rank, appointment and utilisation. Corrective action implies
**regimental intervention by the command or delegated au-**
thority in minor transgressions with the intent to impact with
**immediate effect on the transgressor’s conduct.**

13. Subjectivity. Any person subject to the Military Discipline Supplementary Measures Act (Act 16 of 1999) may be
subjected to minor corrective measures, whether inside or outside the borders of the Republic.

14. Execution Authority. Officers commanding or superior officers may implement minor corrective measures against
any direct subordinate.

15. Minor Corrective Action.
a. A minor corrective action must:
i. Be formally recorded in writing in the prescribed manner.


8 _SANDF Military Dictionary, p 79, ‘Command Authority is the lawful authority every officer has over soldiers in his/her charge by virtue of the respective_
officer’s rank and appointment’.


-----

ii. Be applied with a sense of immediacy.
iii. Promote or enforce the **maintenance of**
**routine discipline within a unit.**
iv. Comply with the principles of proportion**ality and appropriateness with regard to:**
(1) The transgression or default.
(2) The impact on operational effectiveness.
(3) The adverse impact, or likely impact, on
the individual or unit.
(4) The transgressor’s/defaulter’s rank, age
or rate of remuneration where relevant.
v. Be carried out under supervision, where
appropriate.
b. A minor corrective action must not:
i. Be unreasonable.
ii. Have public humiliation as an objective.
iii. Result in unreasonable or unjustified
discrimination.
c. Minor corrective actions may include the following
non-punitive regimental measures:
i. Special instruction with regard to accepted
dress requirements.
ii. Conditioning drills and instructions.
iii. Drill practice.
iv. Repetitive instructions.
v. Corrective training.
vi. Additional duties.

###### MILITARY DISCIPLINARY SYSTEM

16. The military disciplinary system serves to empower commanders to effectively enforce military discipline through the
medium of military courts. This will support the command line
to uphold the discipline and behaviour required for the maintenance of operational effectiveness.

17. **Terms and Principles. The following terms and prin-**
ciples are defined:
a. **Disciplinary Measures. Disciplinary measures**
may be taken by the chain of command, using statutory powers, to uphold good order and military discipline. Disciplinary measures are taken where it is
necessary to correct breaches of discipline, punish the individual and/or deter others.
b. **Military Justice System. The line commander**
may undertake disciplinary measures through statutory powers, to uphold, maintain and enforce good
order and military discipline[9]. Military judicial mea

sures are taken where a **statutory military of-**
**fence has been committed and it is necessary to**
punish behavioural deviations of individual or group
conduct.

18. Substratum of the Military Disciplinary System.
The substratum embodies the following:
a. A military discipline statute.
b. A code of conduct for uniformed members.
c. A code on the legal rights of the soldier.
d. Military law training at each level of staff training.
e. The execution of the provisions of the statute by
competent functionaries with a sense of integrity and
justice.
f. The primary role of managing the efficiency of a disciplinary system is led, inter alia, by officers commanding, commanding officers at all levels, unit adjutants,
regimental and other sergeant-majors or coxswains
and other warrant officers, military police officials,
military law practitioners and the military courts.

###### MILITARY COURTS

19. The Military Discipline Supplementary Measures Act (Act
16 of 1999) establishes the following military courts:
a. The **Commanding** **Officer’s** **Disciplinary**
**Hearing.**
b. The Court of a Military Judge.
c. The Court of a Senior Military Judge.
d. The Court of Military Appeals.

20. The Military Discipline Supplementary Measures Act (Act
16 of 1999) creates new terminology which steps away from
internationally recognised terminology. This has been counterproductive and it is recommended that the term ‘courts martial’
is reintroduced into the South African military justice system,
with greater participation in the proceedings of military courts by
military line-officers[10] albeit in conjunction with legal officers.

###### COMMANDING OFFICER’S DISCIPLINARY HEARINGS

21. A commanding officer and every officer subordinate in
rank to such commanding officer and of a rank not less than field
rank, who is authorised thereto in writing by such commanding
officer, may conduct a disciplinary hearing of any person subject
to the Military Disciplinary Code, other than an officer or warrant officer, who has elected to be heard by a commanding of

9 Sections 11 and 12(1) (i)(j)(k)(l) and (m) of the Military Disciplinary Supplementary Measures Act (Act No 16 of 1999) determine the penal jurisdiction
of a Commanding Officer’s Disciplinary Hearing.

10 Line-officer specifically refers to a combat officer or other non-lawyer officer in the line of command.


-----

ficer, for any military disciplinary offence, and may on conviction
sentence the offender to any prescribed punishment. The pe**nal jurisdiction of a Commanding Officer’s Disciplinary**
**Hearing is as follows:**
a. A fine not exceeding R600,00.
b. In the case of a private or equivalent rank, confinement to barracks for a period not exceeding 21
days.
c. In the case of a private or equivalent rank, corrective
punishment for a period not exceeding 21 days.
d. Extra non-consecutive duties for a period not exceeding 21 days.
e. A reprimand.

22. A person subject to the Military Disciplinary Code of a
rank not higher than staff sergeant or its equivalent rank may,
in respect of a charge relating to a military disciplinary offence
on which that person intends to tender a plea of guilty, if he or
she elects to be dealt with by a disciplinary hearing, be so heard
without legal representation.

23. Every finding of guilty, any sentence imposed and every order made by a Commanding Officer’s Disciplinary Hearing shall be subject to the process of ‘automatic’ review. Every sentence shall be reviewed by a review counsel who
may uphold the finding and the sentence: provided that, if the
review counsel is of the opinion that the finding or sentence
should not be upheld or on the request of the Director Military Judicial Reviews, that counsel shall submit the record or the
requested record of the proceedings, together with his or her
views on the case, to the Director Military Judicial Reviews, who
may thereupon, subject to the changes required by the context,
exercise in respect of those proceedings, the powers conferred
on a Court of Military Appeals, or refer the case to a Court of
Military Appeals.

24. The sanction imposed by the commanding officer presiding at a Commanding Officer’s Disciplinary Hearing is reviewed
by a Military Judicial Review Counsel.  Such Review Counsel
may review the facts or law of that case or the validity or justice
of any finding, sentence or order made thereat and may uphold
the finding and the sentence.  Should the Review Counsel be
of the view that the finding or sentence should not be upheld,
he or she may request the Director Military Judicial Reviews to
exercise the powers conferred on a Court of Military Appeals.
The Director Military Judicial Reviews may also refer the case to
a Court of Military Appeals.

25. The accused person also has the right to approach the
High Court for relief at his or her own cost.


###### COURTS OF SENIOR MILITARY JUDGES AND MILITARY JUDGES

26. A military court may try any statutory military as well as
certain criminal offences. The punishments which may be imposed by a military court are one or more of:
a. imprisonment;
b. in the case of an officer:
i. cashiering; or
ii. dismissal from the Defence Force;
c. in the case of any **rank other than that of an**
**officer:**
i. discharge with ignominy from the Defence
Force; or
ii. discharge from the Defence Force;
d. in the case of any **rank other than that of an**
**officer, detention for a period not exceeding two**
years;
e. in the case of **a private or equivalent rank,**
field punishment for a period not exceeding three
months;
f. in the case of an officer:
i. reduction to any lower commissioned rank;
or
ii. reversion from any acting or temporary rank
to his or her substantive rank;
g. in the case of any **rank other than that of an**
**officer:**
i. reduction to any lower rank, to any non-commissioned rank or to the ranks; or
ii. reversion from any acting or temporary rank
to his or her substantive rank;
h. reduction in seniority in rank;
i. a fine not exceeding R 6000,00;
j. in the case of a private or equivalent rank, confinement to barracks for a period not exceeding 21
days;
k. in the case of a private or equivalent rank, corrective punishment for a period not exceeding 21
days;
l. in the case of any rank other than that of an
**officer:**
i. extra non-consecutive duties for a period not
exceeding 21 days; or
ii. a reprimand.

27. Where it is impractical to impose the punishment of detention or confinement to barracks, including where the offender is serving outside the borders of the Republic or on a
ship which is at sea, in lieu of that punishment, a military court


-----

may sentence the offender to be deprived of his or her pay as
prescribed.

28. In case of a sentence of detention or imprisonment, a military court may order the operation of the whole or any portion
of the sentence of detention, or the whole of the sentence of
imprisonment to be suspended as it may determine in its order.

29. The jurisdiction of military courts extends to certain categories of civilian persons as depicted in Section 3 of the Military
Discipline Supplementary Measures Act (Act 16 of 1999).

30. Every acquittal or discharge of an accused shall be final,
but every finding of guilty, any sentence imposed and any order
made by a military court shall be subject to the process of review
by a Military Judicial Review Counsel or the Court of Military
Appeals or on application be dealt with by the Court of Military
Appeals.

###### COURTS OF MILITARY APPEALS

31. A Court of Military Appeals shall be the highest military
**court and a judgement thereof will bind all other mili-**
**tary courts. A Court of Military Appeals shall be both institu-**
tionally and judicially independent from executive or command
interference.

32. A Court of Military Appeals shall be competent to exer**cise full appeal and review in respect of the proceedings**
of any case or hearing conducted before any military court and
may, after due consideration of the record of the proceedings of
any case or hearing and of any representations submitted to it or
argument heard by it:


a. **uphold the finding or the finding and the sentence;**
b. **refuse to uphold the finding and set the sentence**
aside;
c. **substitute for the finding any valid finding; or**
d. if it has upheld the finding, or substituted a finding,
**vary the sentence.**

33. A Court of Military Appeals shall comprise at least a serving
Judge or retired Judge of any division of the High Court of South
Africa (Chairperson), a serving military law practitioner (Member) with experience exceeding ten years in the administration
of military or criminal justice and an officer with experience in
exercising command in the field in the conducting of operations
(Member). Independence further requires that the modes of appointment to a Court of Military Appeals and the conditions of
service of its members are free from command influence.

###### REVIEW BY A HIGH COURT

34. Upon sentencing a convicted person, a military court shall
inform such person, inter alia, of his or her right to approach the
High Court for relief at his or her own cost.[11]

###### CIVILIAN COURT

35. Members of the Defence Force can be tried in civil courts
for common law, statutory and military offences. They can also
be tried in military courts for military offences and for most common law and statutory offences. There is also protection against
double jeopardy between the two court systems. However,
only military courts, and no other South African court, can exercise criminal jurisdiction in respect of offences committed by
soldiers outside the borders of South Africa (extra-territorial
jurisdiction).


11 Charnelley notes that “review to the High Court has not been, and should not be, excluded”, p 77 in Scientia Militaria, South African Journal of Military
Studies, Vol 33, Nr 2, 2005, “The South African Military Court System – Independent, Impartial and Constitutional?”.

## DEFENCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS


##### INTEGRATED DEFENCE INFORMATION SYSTEM


###### REQUIREMENT

1. Defence’s legacy information systems no longer support
defence business efficiently and are becoming unaffordable to
operate and sustain. This results in the majority of available
funding being directed to operating and sustaining these legacy
systems and therefore insufficient funding being available for renewal and investment. Defence thus requires the establishment
of an integrated management system to drive both defence administration and defence command and control. To this end an
‘integrated defence enterprise system’ will be established as the
backbone information system for end-to-end defence business
processes.

2. The pursuit of an integrated defence enterprise system
will be a matter of utmost priority. It will replace the disjointed


legacy defence information systems and will provide automated,
real-time, end-to-end defence management - supporting both
defence administration (blue network) and military command
and control (red network).

3. The National Treasury programme, the Integrated Resource Management System, will have a major impact on the
replacement of the current legacy defence corporate systems
and will imply that Defence will have to develop the unique
functionalities to conduct those elements of its business which
are not included in the integrated financial management system.
The migration to the National Treasury’s Integrated Resource
Management System implies that Defence will utilise information systems common to all government departments.

4. The integrated defence enterprise system and ‘general
defence network’ (blue network) will be established as the foundation for all defence business processes and activities, including
adding and reusing information functionality as it becomes available (Figure 13-1).

5. The integrated defence enterprise system means the
complete spectrum of:


-----

a. Establishing agile and dynamic
policy on systems, software and
standards, with cascading directives and delegations. This must
be based on best-practices policy
standards across the technology
platform and may require Defence to obtain cutting edge decision-support services during this
process.
b. Collaboratively building the enterprise system, by establishing in
parallel the following dimensions:
i. Business processes across
the resource areas.
ii. The communication and
network infrastructure.
iii. Granular security.
c. Establishing web-based business
systems that enhance functionality
and end-to-end values chain in all
resource areas.
d. Establishing resource services

_Figure 13-1: Next Generation Enterprise Architecture_

processes in all functional areas.
e. Ongoing enhancement of the
platform through new business

processes, services and functionality. e. Data clean-up of all legacy functional systems by

functional owners.

6. The enterprise system must integrate and optimise all f. Data integrity determination by functional owners.
defence information system requirements and serve as a ba- g. Staggered migration of personnel, logistic, finance
sis for ensuring standardisation, compatibility, connectivity and and procurement systems to the defence enterprise
interoperability. resource management system.

h. Archiving of data.


7. Proven systems are in service in some defence forces
across the world having already been adapted for unique military
use. An option is to procure such a proven military-off-the-shelf
(MOTS) enterprise system where the development and adaption costs have already been borne by other parties and which
has already been tailored for both military use and modern compliance, accounting and reporting standards. A MOTS enterprise
system must be able to interface with government information
systems, yet provide modular security for defence information.

8. The priority milestones, linked to the ICS strategy, in this
process will include:
a. Migration of defence applications to web-based services. Such web-based services may by necessity not
be connected to the Internet.
b. Enhanced personal connectivity for defence
members.
c. Revolutionised office automation.
d. Institution of information systems training at all levels
of the Defence Force.


9. The characteristics of the defence enterprise system will
include:
a. The enablement of combat service support through
automated, tracked, in-transit visible, real-time information which is integrated with various resource
system databases and networks.
b. The defence enterprise system must be:
i. Driven by core Defence Force doctrine and
functional area doctrine.
ii. Granular, secure and accessible.
iii. Compliant with defence regulatory framework
standards.
iv. Integrated across all resource areas.
v. Deployable at all locations of defence activity.
vi. Operational to the lowest functional level in
the field, performing over limited bandwidth
and non-persistent network infrastructure, or
even independently at remote locations.


-----

vii. Complete business-to-business system integration with information at the 5[th] line of support, industry standard information systems
and other defence information management
systems.
viii. Enabling of data integrity and clean-up of disparate information.
ix. Enabling of accountability and reporting across
all levels and functions.
x. Enabling of organisational auditability and set
standards.
xi. Enabling of compliance with standards.
xii. Enabling of aggregated business intelligence.
xiii. Contribution to organisational performance
management and organisational reporting.
xiv. Contribution to early warning and risk
aversion.
c. The defence enterprise system must be able to
adapt to rapidly changing business process architecture, data and technology with minimal delay and

cost, and without requiring changes
in the information system platform
and software.

###### DEFENCE COMMAND AND CONTROL

10. The ability to exercise command and control is critical to the effective execution of the
defence mission, goals and tasks. The diversity
of military tasks performed by different combat,
combat support, combat service support and
other support structures requires both single service and joint command and control capabilities.

11. Military command and control will be driven by the concept of “network enabled command and control” through standardised newgeneration digital communication equipment
capable of transferring all types of data on the
battlefield, thus facilitating network-enabled operations and improved situational awareness.

12. The command and control network (red
network) will be a sub-set of the defence enterprise network (blue network) within the ‘next
generation technology platform’, supported by
enhanced granular security. This network will
prioritise quality, integrity and reliability.


###### PERSONAL MOBILE CONNECTIVITY OF DEFENCE PERSONNEL

13. Portable interconnectivity between defence personnel,
independent of the place of work and from remote locations,
is crucial for both effective command and control and management in the workplace. To this end, web-based connectivity
between members and employees at appropriate levels in the
organisation must be enhanced. The defence enterprise system
must thus provide integrated work-place electronic connectivity
enabling real-time communication between members responsible for the command and management of the organisation.


##### PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT


###### ORGANISATIONAL PERFORMANCE

14. Defence performance management is defined as that set
of management processes, supported by information technology, that help to improve the execution of strategy, day-to-day


_Figure 13-2: Overarching National Planning, Budgeting and Reporting Cycle_


-----

management and decision-making. Performance management
enables the definition and communication of identified strategies,
performance plans, measures and targets that are to be pursued
in the improvement of organisational performance. Figure 13-2
depicts the national planning, budgeting and reporting cycle.

15. The performance management process must enhance the
formulation of strategic objectives, provide measures for performance and analyse and generate reports on organisational performance as well as align the people and culture towards achieving the set objectives. Performance reporting, both financial and
non-financial, is therefore essential in measuring and quantifying
organisational performance and compliance.

16. The accurate provision of financial information such as
budgets, expenditures and revenues remains critical for the determination of the costs and efficiencies of programmes. On the
other hand, the accurate provision of non-financial information
such as outcomes and outputs is equally important for assessing
the effectiveness and progress of the organisation.


###### DEFENCE PERFORMANCE MONITORING AND EVALUATION

18. Performance management has numerous facets which are
broadly grouped to the following areas:
a. Organisational performance.
b. Employee performance.

19. The selection of a performance management tool is critical and must allow for the full range of assessment, including
assessing the organisation against the achievement of its objectives or required outcomes. The performance management tool
must also provide the ability to assess and manage the performance of individual employees against their respective individual
performance agreements which must be concomitantly aligned
to organisational outcomes. In so doing, the employees will be
aligned to the required outcomes of the organisation. Each area
of performance management is continuously tested and evaluated in accordance with a cycle as depicted in Figure 13-3 below.


20. Monitoring and evaluation forms part of the overarching

therefore are drivers to an adjustment
to future-oriented strategies. Measurement of performance therefore ensures, inter alia, that:
a. Civil oversight and control
are enhanced.
b. Organisational policy is
complied with.
c. Policy, planning, budgeting
and reporting are aligned
to ensure enhanced efficiency and effectiveness.
d. Funding equates to measurable results.
e. Information is utilised strategically to improve policy
and funding choices.
f. The defence value-proposition is defined and
pursued.
g. Individual employee performance and accountability are enhanced.
h. Organisational and individual focus remains on
the defence mandate and
policy priorities.

ning process so that new outcomes, outputs and performance
baselines and indicators can be set.

21. Figure 13-4 depicts the monitoring and evaluation process
and sub-processes that culminate in the required performance
reports which enhance civil control and oversight.

###### RISK MANAGEMENT

22. Risks to organisational performance are identified during
the annual planning phase and are then aligned to performance
indicators and targets as set out in the annual performance plan.
These identified risks are generally based on assumptions made
during the planning phase.

23. The application of risk management during planning allows
for the development of contingencies and a systematic approach
to mitigation of the negative consequences of the materialising
risks. When risks are properly identified, there is a correlation
between the deviations from planned performance and the risks
that were identified.


###### DEFENCE ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURING

25. The design and structure of
the Defence Force must be informed by the defence mandate,
mission, goals and tasks, coupled to
defence doctrine. The policy, philosophy, concept and doctrine for defence structure management must
thus enable rapid and responsible
structure management throughout
the defence organisation, including: the establishment, adjustment
and alignment of structures under
delegation by Service and Division
chiefs.

26. Consequently, the Defence
Act (Act No 42 of 2002) must be
amended to provide a clear and

considered mandate for the management of defence organisational structures. The following principles must be embedded in
the amendment:
a. The Head of Department and Accounting Officer
must establish and maintain the defence macrostructure, under approval of the Minister as the Executive Authority. Such macro-structure will enjoy
the force of policy.
b. The defence macro-structure must be reviewed
every five years, or if there are required changes to
the Defence Force Establishment Table, or if there
is any other amendment the Minister may deem
necessary.
c. The Minister retains the authority to open and close
force structure elements and commission and decommission vessels, ships, aircraft, vehicles systems,
combat systems and combat-support systems.
d. The defence macro-structure must include:
i. The mandate of each Service and Division.
ii. The outputs for each Service and Division.
iii. The post-structure threshold for each Service


-----

and Division, inclusive of the Regular, Reserve
and civilian components, and indicating thresholds of both active and non-active posts.
iv. A personnel budget ceiling of each Service and
Division, expressed in the Rand value of a particular financial year.
v. As a general principle, at least 30% of active
posts on the corporate force structure will be
reserved for Reserves to rotate through. This
number may be higher at unit level and lower
at headquarters level.
e. Chiefs of Services and Divisions will:
i. Receive appropriate delegations to undertake organisational structure management
within the context of composite guidelines and
restrictions.
ii. Have own inherent capacity to administerate
own organisational structures within the context of given delegation, policy, guidelines and
restrictions.
iii. Constantly pursue a balance between personnel, operating and capital costs.
iv. Remain aligned with the approved defence
macro-structure.
v. Ensure sustainability of prescribed macro-capabilities and achieve set deliverables.
27. The Head of Department and Accounting Officer must
enable the establishment of organisational structuring, internal
controls, not limited to:
a. Establishing organisational structure management
practices, procedures and standards.
b. Providing functional training on organisational structure management.
c. Ensuring quality control of defence structures.
d. Maintaining the necessary ICT system.

1 Defence Act, 2002 (Act No 42 of 2002), Section 12(2)(b).


###### DEFENCE FORCE ESTABLISHMENT TABLE

28. The role, shape, size and footprint of the Defence Force
must be determined as the firm basis for future defence planning and be expressed in a Defence Force Establishment Table.
The Defence Force Establishment Table, informing the defence
macro-structure, must provide at least the following information:
a. The name, nature and purpose of each force structure element.
b. An indication of the opening or closing date of the
force structure element.
c. The envisaged readiness level of the force structure
element.
d. The mixture of Regulars, Reserves and defence civilians in the force structure element.
e. An indication of the prime mission equipment of the
force structure element.
f. The embedded support system within the force
structure element

29. The Defence Force Establishment Table excludes any temporary task force, temporary headquarter, group element or unit
established by the Chief of the Defence Force for military exercises or operations[1].

30. The Defence Force Establishment Table must be presented by the Chief of the Defence Force to the Minister on at
least a five-yearly basis for approval. It must be a configured and
controlled Defence Force document and must enjoy the force
of policy. The achievement of the Defence Force Establishment
Table, however, remains critically dependent on resources. Thus
the Defence Force will continuously mitigate these resource
constraints by adjusting the levels of readiness of force structure
elements, as well as through a careful mixture of Regulars and
Reserves within the ‘one-force’ approach.

31. Should the allocated or anticipated resources be insufficient to establish and sustain the capabilities required, adjustments to the defence requirement, the defence concept or the
resource allocation (or a combination of these) will be required
to establish a balance between intent and available resources.

## DEFENCE RESOURCE SYSTEMS


##### INTRODUCTION


and the impact of transverse resource systems are depicted in
the cross impact matrix below (Figure 14-1).


1. The rapidly changing strategic environment requires an
agile and balanced military force that can execute its function in
pursuit of national security in the most efficient and effective way
possible, across the defence mission goals and tasks. Flexibility
remains essential.

2. The defence design, structure, profile and footprint are
critical for establishing affordability and therefore sustainability.
The execution of the defence function is achieved through the
integration of the force design, the supporting capabilities vested
in the force structure, resources and efficient business processes. This integration is managed by the staff system and enabled
by an integrated ICT system and a business process architecture
tailored to defence needs and supported in its decision-making
by an appropriate defence science, engineering and technology
capability. At the highest level these functions are directed, orchestrated and controlled by the respective Chiefs of Staff Divisions. Units, across the different levels, must be structured for
the required support capabilities necessary for the successful attainment of their respective tasks. The functional resource areas

_Figure 14-1: Support Functions Cross Impacted against Core Capabilities_


##### OVERARCHING DEFENCE SERVICE SUPPORT DOCTRINE


###### DEFENCE COMBAT SERVICE SUPPORT PRINCIPLES

3. Defence combat service support is an overarching function
providing combat services with support across the full spectrum
of conflict. It is the process of supplying combat services with
resource support including equipment, facilities, consumables,
personnel and finance support for the successful attainment of
the defence mission, goals and tasks. In simple terms, defence
combat service support includes health support, personnel
resources, logistic resources, financial resources, organisation
structure and the ability of the force to continually sustain and
restore itself.  Defence combat service support can only be a
joint defence endeavour. This combat service support doctrine
is applicable to all support functions and support commands.
Combat service support will be provided within (Figure 14-2):


-----

a. **5[th] Line Support. Support from the industrial**
and commercial base of both national and international partners. This may include the national and
international defence industry and various civilian
institutions.
b. **4[th] Line Support. Support from the deeper levels**
in the Defence Force, extending to static bases, mobilisation centres, depots and other static establishments in the rear area. The delivery of this support
is a joint responsibility of both combat services and
combat service support, and includes common and
unique support.
c. **3[rd] Line Support. Support from both static and**
mobile Defence Force capabilities deployed to
shorten the lines of communication to deployed
combat forces in the combat zone. In the SA Army,
it would be the responsibility of the combat division
to provide 3[rd] line support. This may include forward
basing, preposition and forward mounting.
d. **2[nd] Line Support. Intermediate support capability**
which is provided in the theatre of operations. In the
case of the SA Army, it would be the responsibility of
the brigade to provide a second line support.
e. **1[st] Line Support.** Organisation and organic support at the unit level, provided organisationally at
unit level in the theatre of operations. The unit is
required to provide support to its sub-units and lower organisations. In the case of the SA Army, 1[st] line
support is organisationally provided at the battalion
level.

_Figure 14-2: Direct Orchestrate and Control Support_


4. The defence enterprise information system is a critical intervention to drive all combat service support. Combat service
support remains critically reliant on such a transverse system.

5. The following common principles will guide all components of the defence combat service support system through
centralised direction and decentralised execution:
a. **Functional Authority.**
i. Functional control is embedded in the respective staff division, which is responsible to
plan, orchestrate, direct and control support
through, inter alia, the provision of functional
policy, doctrine, functional and competency
standards and standardisation, and training
curricula.
ii. Functional authorities are responsible for the
integration of functional doctrine with Defence
Force doctrine, multinational doctrine and
practices.
b. **Functional Competency Authorities. Func-**
tional competency authorities are, of necessity, appointed and mandated from both combat services
and staff divisions to provide military certification for
defence prime mission equipment, support equipment, munitions, personnel selection, and personnel
competency certificates.
c. **Combat Services.**
i. Combat forces will have all necessary inherent support capabilities up to the battalion or
equivalent level.


-----

ii. Combat forces are, in turn, sustained by
the intermediate and deeper level support
structures.
iii. Combat services are responsible for their
unique own 5[th] to 1[st] line support.
d. **Common Support. Transverse support of a com-**
mon nature, normally of significant quantity, will be
provided through the command and staff capabilities
of the Chief of the Defence Force. This may extend
to, inter alia:
i. Setting of term and transverse procurement
contracts.
ii. Management of common commodities and
services.
iii.    Facilities.
iv. Career management.
v. Pension management.
vi. Professional development training.
vii. Military tertiary education and development.

###### DEFENCE SUPPORT AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL

6. The National Executive provides strategic guidance on
priorities and national interests. It further determines the National Defence Policy, and determines the quantity, quality
and level of strategic national resources required (eg: oil, ammunition, strategic lift). This sustainment may be coordinated
with international partners. At the national level, sustainment is
planned and coordinated interdepartmentally with role-playing
departments responsible for various national strategic resources
and industry. The Defence Force is resourced according to the
National Defence Policy. The Commander-in-Chief, together


with the National Executive, consults on and determines the defence budget allocation. Funds are appropriated by Parliament
by means of a vote.

###### CONCEPTS TO ENHANCE DEFENCE COMBAT SERVICE SUPPORT

7. The Defence Force is responsible, within resource guidelines set by the Executive, to ensure adequate and appropriate
combat service support. The Defence Force is responsible for
mobilising and preparing adequate defence personnel and to
conclude contracts with the defence industry for product acquisition, services, maintenance, procurement, sustainment,
movement and concentration of defence matériel.

8. The defence combat service support system must have
the capability to support and sustain combat forces over protracted periods of time, over extended distances, in diverse
and complex theatres and along multiple lines of communication. Given inherently long supply lines, planning must ensure
the physical security of sustainment installations and lines of
communication.

###### Expeditionary Support

9. Deployed forces must have joint and expeditionary sustainment capabilities that support the full spectrum of conflict,
consistent with the joint operational concept. This requires a
single, integrated, responsive, end-to-end distribution system, capable of interfacing with inter-agency and multinational
capabilities.

###### Forward Basing, Preposition and Forward Mounting

10. The foundation of the expeditionary sustainment system
is the maintenance of strategic, operational and tactical reserve


-----

stocks and the pre-positioning (forward sustainment) of stock at
identified land and sea positions in accordance with the operational requirements that may exist at a particular time.

###### JI[2]M Support

11. Defence will support its interdepartmental and inter-agency activities within the framework of the given mission.
a. Within joint forces, the Joint Force HQ will be responsible to sustain its forces with regard to common items.
b. The Joint Force HQ will also be responsible for
equipment that is mission-specific but that is not part
of normal service equipment.
c. Combat services will provide own unique
sustainment.

###### Defence Reserve Stock Levels

12. Defence must prescribe the level of reserve stocks to be
maintained to support the spectrum of defence missions, goals
and tasks. These must be able to support rapidly escalating
force levels as the core force expands into the surge force. This
includes:
a **Strategic Reserve Stocks. Reserves that are de-**
termined by the full spectrum of potential threats to
security. These reserves are maintained to bridge
the gap between peace and national defence (mobilisation reserves, etc).
b. **Operational Reserve Stocks. Operational re-**
serves are determined by risks emanating from foreseeable operational contingencies such as imminent
military threats, regional disasters, regional instability,
crime and domestic instability (health care, disaster
relief, air supply, etc).
c. **Tactical Reserve Stocks. Tactical reserves are**
designed to achieve superiority during military engagements through the employment of operational
and combat support units (support echelons, spare
bandwidth, deployment-in-depth, etc).

###### STRATEGIC RESOURCE ALIGNMENT

13. Strategic alignment and convergence must be achieved
between the various resource systems in order that common
implementation approaches are adopted. Common approaches
and processes are to be used to support both force preparation
and force employment so that sustainable combat-ready forces
are produced and employed. This entails the harmonisation of
the approaches between the various defence resource systems:
a. A **single defence plan identifies the resources**
required to meet defence objectives. This defence
plan ensures alignment between assigned objectives


and allocated resources per programme. The single
defence plan forms the basis for the consequent acquisition, utilisation and management of the allocated
resources to ensure the successful execution of the
defence mandate.
b. The annual **Defence Budget Vote appropriates**
funds to enable investment in defence resources in
accordance with the authorised medium-term defence strategic business plan and programmes. The
Defence Vote allocates funds (spending ceiling) to
the main and sub-programmes, enabling the management of resources on inventory as well as the
procurement of replacement and/or supplementary
resources.
c. While this single defence plan entails a process of
**centralised strategic direction and functional**
**authority, the execution of the plan and the sub-**
sequent utilisation of the resources will be decentralised to ensure its effective, efficient, and economical
management. The realisation of a credible force design and force structure for the Defence Force is dependent on the appropriate allocation of resources.
d. **Support is a command function. As such, com-**
manders at all levels will be responsible, accountable
and empowered to execute the plan through the
management of all resources, the fostering of appropriate human skills and appropriate personnel,
logistics and financial delegations and authorities.
e. The effective, efficient and economical utilisa**tion of such critical resources within each resource**
management system is of paramount importance to
meet functional requirements.
f. All resource systems must provide **management**
**information and advice to defence decisions mak-**
ers. The information provided in each area must
integrate with all other resource areas, using a de**fence enterprise system.**
g. **All commanders and managers must ac-**
**count for their compliance with policy and perfor-**
mance against the defence plan and programmes on
a quarterly and annual basis as prescribed in national
legislation.
h. **Internal controls, risk and performance**
**management must be an integrated aspect of each**
resource system.


##### KEY DEFENCE RESOURCE MANAGEMENT TENETS


###### PRINCIPLES

14. The Chief of the Defence Force must be capacitated by
appropriate professional and technical expertise to man

-----

age and account for all defence resources allocated. The main
divisions of defence resources are:
a. Personnel.
b. Intelligence.
c. Operations.
d.    Logistics.
e.   Planning.
f. Information and Communication Systems (ICS).
g.   Training.
h.   Finance.
i. Specialist Staffs.

15. The defence resource management system will be compliant with all resource administration prescripts in statute and
regulation.

16. The utilisation of defence resources must be audited and
reported upon to the National Executive and the Legislature, as
may be prescribed in law.

17. The general principle of transparency is espoused and will
be pursued. Notwithstanding, care will be taken to provide,
within the Rules of Parliament, for reporting on confidential aspects of the broader defence function.

###### DEFENCE ACCOUNTABILITY AND    DELEGATION REGIME

 Defence Accountability Concept

18. The Head of Department and Accounting Officer is accountable for all defence resources. Linked to the organisational
renewal imperative hereunder, the current defence accountability concept must be re-assessed, and if necessary, adjusted
in order that the Head of Department and Defence Accounting
Officer is able to fully meet his or her statutory accountability
responsibilities and obligations.

###### Defence Resource Delegation Regime

19. The current manner whereby responsibility, authority and
accountability for resources are delegated from the Accounting Officer, across the entire defence organisation and down to
the unit level, compromises military command and control, and
specifically the integrity of the line of command. In accordance
with the principles stated earlier in this chapter:
a. Due cognisance must be given to the unique nature of the Defence Force relative to the wider
public service.
b. Commanders must have the necessary delegations to execute their assigned mandates, have
commensurate responsibility and authority over
all resources assigned, and must account for such
resources.


20. In this instance, it is imperative that recognition is given
throughout the wider public service that the military organisation is by nature a hierarchical one. Delegations, and concomitant responsibility, authority and accountability, must formally
cascade down the command line, one step at a time, from each
level of command to the next level of subordinate. Without this
understanding, commanders cannot account for the performance of a subordinate against a delegation.

21. It is thus imperative that the Defence Act be urgently
amended to provide for a comprehensive defence resource
delegation regime in law, whereby powers and duties can be
delegated down the command line – one step at a time along
that line – with commanders at all levels being responsible and
accountable for their resources.

22. The defence resource delegation regime must be embedded in and be enabled through the fully integrated and defencewide enterprise system and its associated infrastructure.

###### Defence Enterprise Information System

23. An integrated defence enterprise information system,
linked to the National Treasury’s Integrated Resource Management System, is required as the backbone information system
to drive both defence administration and defence command
and control. It must integrate and optimise all other defence
information sub-system requirements and serve as a basis for
ensuring standardisation, compatibility, connectivity and interoperability. It will be established as the foundation for all defence
business processes and activities.

###### RESOURCE MANAGEMENT IN THE DEFENCE FORCE

24. Chief of Staff. The Chief of Staff will, within the defence
staff system:
a. Assist the Chief of the Defence Force in the following capacities as:
i. **Organiser. The Chief of Staff, as organiser,**
directs the activities of the staff towards the
results and plans all the necessary resources.
ii. **Administrator. The Chief of Staff, as admin-**
istrator, performs operative management to
ensure the normal flow of all the processes
of the staff divisions, as well as proportional
distribution of the resources and overseeing
their effective use.
iii. **Manager and Leader. The Chief of Staff, as**
manager and leader, implements the integration of staff issues, when the work of the staff
members will be encouraged and directed towards the results.
b. Support the Chief of the Defence Force in the deci

-----

sion-making process by integrating and coordinating
the activities of the allocated staffs.
c. Coordinate the work of the staff divisions by giving
clear direction and setting priorities, thus in effect
acting as the “programme director”.
d. Impose order within the headquarters, arbitrate any
disputes between members of the staff, facilitate the
workflow between the staffs, communicate decisions to all members of the staffs and provide for the
management of the veracity of all management information pertaining to information emanating from
supporting staffs.

25. **Planning. The Chief of the Defence Force’s planning**
staff will set strategic direction through the establishment of outcomes, outputs and targets, which in turn enable planning and
the allocation of resources, including:
a. **Defence Force Programmes. Setting the De-**
fence Force’s programme and sub-programme
architecture.
b. **Defence Force Planning. Directing, orchestrating**
and controlling the annual Defence Force planning
process, which will in turn support the delivery of
the defence strategy by articulating the strategic outcomes required and allocating outputs and targets
to programme and sub-programme owners. This
is achieved through annual planning guidelines that
inform the next annual planning process.
c. **Annual Strategic Environmental Analysis.**
An annual disciplined military appreciation process
to assess the strategic environment for purposes of
informing both strategy and planning.
d. **Military Strategy. The Military Strategy, by which**
the Defence Force implements the National Security Strategy, the Defence mission, goals and tasks
and the concurrent detailed strategy direction (short,
medium, long and extended-long term).
e. **Defence Capabilities. Planning the capabilities**
required to meet defence objectives, desired operational outcomes and effects. Defence capabilities are
made up of force elements (ships, aircraft, combat
forces and other force enablers) with associated personnel, training, equipment, logistics, information,
infrastructure, concepts, doctrine and organisation.
This will be expressed formally as the Chief of the
Defence Force’s Force Design.
f. **Performance Monitoring, Risk and Evalua-**
**tion. Planning is further the process owner for per-**
formance and risk management to ensure that the
Defence Force meets stated outcomes.
g. **Performance Reporting. Performance reporting**
will be achieved through a quarterly performance
and risk report showing progress in implementing
Defence Force outcomes, outputs and targets set


out in the defence plan, and an annual audited report of the performance of programmes and subprogrammes against the defence plan.
h. **Cluster Management. Timeous and relevant De-**
fence Force reports and policy inputs to the cluster
system.
i. **Defence Structure Management. The estab-**
lishment and the maintenance of an effective Defence Force structure management service that directs enterprise business processes and structures
that are supportive to the implementation of the
Department of Defence Strategy.

26. Personnel. The Chief of the Defence Force’s personnel
staff will:
a. Set the Defence Force’s personnel philosophy, policy, strategy and doctrine.
b. Discharge personnel management duties prescribed
in:
i. Part 2 of Chapter 5 of the Public Finance Management Act, 1999 (Act No 1 of 1999), the
annual Division of Revenue Act and the Treasury Regulations.
ii. The Public Service Act, 1994 (Act No 103 of
1994) and Public Service Regulations.
c. Coordinate the execution of any other statutory personnel obligations placed on the Chief of the Defence Force.

27. **Logistics. The Chief of the Defence Force’s logistics staff**
will:
a. Set logistics philosophy, policy, strategy and doctrine.
b. Assist the Chief of the Defence Force by discharging
logistic management duties prescribed in Part 2 of
Chapter 5 of the Public Finance Management Act,
1999, the annual Division of Revenue Act and the
Treasury Regulations.
c. Coordinate the execution of any other statutory logistic obligations placed on the Chief of the Defence
Force.

28. **Information and Communication Systems (ICS).**
The Chief of the Defence Force’s ICS staff will:
a. Set the Defence Force’s ICS philosophy, policy, strategy and doctrine, including information systems.
b. Discharge ICS management duties prescribed in:
i. Part 2 of Chapter 5 of the Public Finance Management Act, 1999, the annual Division of
Revenue Act and the Treasury Regulations.
ii. The Promotion of Access to Information Act,
2000 (Act No 2 of 2000).
c. Coordinate the execution of any other statutory
ICS obligations placed on the Chief of the Defence
Force.


-----

29. **Finance. The Chief of the Defence Force’s finance staff**
will:
a. Set the Defence Force’s finance management governance, philosophy, policy, strategy and doctrine.
b. Discharge finance management duties prescribed in
Part 2 of Chapter 5 of the Public Finance Management Act, 1999, the annual Division of Revenue Act
and the Treasury Regulations.
c. Coordinate the execution of any other statutory
finance obligations placed on the Chief of the Defence Force.

30. **I nspector General.**
a. The Inspector General is responsible for the independent investigation, evaluation and assessment of:
i.    Training.
ii. Economy, effectiveness and efficiency.
iii.    Morale.
iv.    Readiness.
b. The Inspector General will provide certificates of
compliance related to the above evaluations and
assessments.
c. The Inspector General will determine the anti-fraud
and ant-corruption strategy and will investigate any
alleged irregularities. The Inspector General will

d. The Inspector General will determine compliance
with national legislation in respect of Occupational
Health and Safety.


makes unique demands on individuals, which are not
experienced by other civilians in the Public Service.
c. All defence personnel must fall under unified legislation that provides for one service dispensation for
all and which is overseen equitably by the Defence
Service Commission.

###### REQUIREMENT

32. Defence personnel are a key resource, the level and quantity of which are determined by the defence mission, goals and
tasks, the derived force structure and post establishment table,
and an appropriate balance between rank and salary levels.

33. A single, comprehensive, and rigorous personnel system
will be established that can be tailored to requirements and that
is capable of delivering support to both internal and external operations from the 5[th] to the 1[st] line of support, in accordance with
defence combat service support doctrine.

34. The ‘one-force’ concept seeks to ensure that Defence is
supported by the most sustainable, effective, integrated and affordable balance of Regulars, Reserves, Defence Civilians and
auxiliaries.

###### DEFENCE PERSONNEL SYSTEM

35. The defence personnel function consists of core elements:
Personnel Strategic Direction and Policy, Personnel Development, Personnel Management and Personnel Transformation.


##### DEFENCE PERSONNEL SYSTEM


###### DEFINITION OF TERM

31. Defence Personnel.
a. Defence personnel comprises
the Regular component, the
Reserve component, the Civilian Component of the Defence
Force, the Defence Secretariat
and the Ministry of Defence, as
well as any member of an Auxiliary Service that may be established in terms of Section 16 of
the Defence Act, 2002 (Act 42 of
2002).
b. This definition recognises that
uniformed and civilian personnel
are not the same, but acknowledges that Defence Civilians
serve a unique organisation that


_Figure 14-3: Defence Personnel Management Value Chain_


-----

These core elements are supported by support elements,
namely that of Personnel Policies and Processes, Personnel
Technology, Personnel Functionaries, Commanders/Managers
and the Personnel Budget. As indicated in the diagram the core
elements of the personnel function are interlinked and cannot
exist in isolation. This integrated approach is supported by the
indicated support elements to ensure an effective, efficient and
economic personnel function for defence (Figure 14-3).

36. The defence personnel system will focus on the organisational requirements of defence and will ensure well-managed
and -administrated and capable defence personnel through the
application of sound defence personnel practices. It will enable
force provisioning, force preparation and force employment
through pursuit of the ‘one-force’ principle by establishing an
appropriate balance between the Regular component, Reserve
component, defence civilians and auxiliaries through tailored
personnel-feeding systems.

37. The system must further:
a. Support local, distant, dispersed and extended
operations.
b. Support participation in international operations.
c. Accord equal priority to all defence strategic goals
and strategic tasks.
d. Comply with the national regulatory framework,
government priorities, internal governance and
stakeholder requirements.
e. Maximise personnel outputs while minimising costs.
f. Reduce personnel risk to as low a level as reasonably
practicable.

38. **Personnel Management Principles. The personnel**
system must be based on the following principles. It must:
a. Comply with the relevant prescribed provisions of
the regulatory framework.
b. Pursue the execution of the defence strategy.
c. Reinforce the competent management of personnel
as a command responsibility, duly assisted by quality
personnel functionaries to provide specialist advice
and guidance and the execution of day-to-day personnel functions.
d. Be comparable to military best practices found in defence forces across the world.
e. Be flexible to meet both defence operational requirements and the needs of individual defence
members.
f. Ensure functional alignment with the defence structural design across a four-tier system.
g. Be directed towards the continuous capacity-building


and empowerment of all defence members through
soundly planned and executed education, training
and development opportunities.
h. Place the ‘right person in the right post at the right
time’, thereby establishing an optimal organisational
fit between people and structures.
i. Possess appropriate technology to facilitate accountable, productive, effective, efficient, economical and
transparent personnel management.
j. Recognise and reward appropriate individual and
group performance.
k. Apply corrective measures to improve undesired
levels of performance.
l. Reflect constitutional values, aspirations and adherence to the principles of equity and equal opportunities, values and diversity, and strive to eradicate all
forms of discrimination through:
i. An enabling transformation environment.
ii. Compliance with legislative prescripts and
imperatives.
iii. Affirming equity and diversity management and
eradicating discrimination.

###### DEFENCE PERSONNEL BUDGET THRESHOLD

39. In order to achieve sustainability of the organisation as a
whole, the ‘compensation for employees’ component of the
budget will not exceed 40% of the annual allocation to defence.
In most environments, at least 8% of the personnel budget will
be ring-fenced and dedicated to the development and utilisation
of the Reserve component, but escalating in the contingency of
higher levels of operational readiness.

40. Milestone 4 of the Defence Strategic Trajectory envisages
a personnel component of approximately 189 000 Regulars, Reserves and defence civilians, of which:
a. 90 000 (48%) Regular members.
b. 82 000 (43%) Reserve members.
c. 17 000 (9%) defence civilians.[1]

41. Notwithstanding the above, the day-to-day strength of the
Defence Force may reflect a Reserve to Regular ratio in favour
of the Regulars. This may especially be true in certain service
delivery elements or where specialist mustering and professions
are found.

42. The post structure and personnel budget for any Auxiliary
Service will be established by the Minister.


1 This figure excludes the civilians employed in the Defence Secretariat and the Ministry of Defence.


-----

###### DIRECT DEFENCE PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT

43. The strategic direction for defence personnel management will be centralised, while the execution of personnel management will be decentralised. Defence personnel management
will be institutionalised as a command function, with full responsibility, accountability and authority fixed by clear delegation to
the lowest appropriate level, supported by a comprehensive
defence enterprise system.

44. The Chief of the Defence Force’s personnel staff are
responsible to plan, orchestrate, direct and control personnel
matters through, inter alia, the provision of personnel policy,
doctrine, functional and competency standards and standardisation, and training curricula. This will be achieved through:
a. Establishing an appropriate and relevant personnel
regulatory framework.
b. Integrated planning, consolidated reporting, internal
controls and risk management.
c. Determining personnel output objectives and directing strategic resource allocation.
d. Positioning the civilian education sector and military
education and training institutions to support the development of defence members.
e. Determining strategic, operational and tactical personnel reserves through a risk-based approach to
ensure that the demand and supply of defence personnel are affordably reconciled.
f. Determining employment systems characterising
the unique requirements of defence.
g. Establishing an integrated personnel risk management system and process.
h. Establishing labour and service relations appropriate
to the unique attributes of defence.
i. Establishing a grievance system at all levels of the
organisation.

45. Defence will develop and implement its personnel strategy through personnel sub-strategies that specifically address
the following:
a. Integrated corporate personnel support plans coupled to the medium-term strategic framework and
the medium-term expenditure framework.
b. Rigorous governance, compliance monitoring, risk management and appropriate wellness
programmes.
c. Individual and organisational performance management with a jeopardy and reward system in performance monitoring that enhances accountability and
responsibility.


d. Updated personnel regulatory framework, policies
and personnel delegations in support of all personnel functions.
e. Empowered line managers, commanders and personnel functionaries in all defence subsystems and
functions.
f. Appropriate resilience interventions for defence
personnel.

###### EXECUTE DEFENCE PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT

46. Combat services, combat support services and units at all
levels will execute their own personnel management. Personnel
and financial delegations, organisational capabilities and information systems will be cascaded to the lowest appropriate levels
within the Defence Force, but not beyond the unit level. To this
end, personnel management capabilities will be embedded up
to the unit level, but will not extend to sub-unit and sub-sub-unit
level.

###### DEFENCE PERSONNEL INFORMATION SYSTEM

47. The defence personnel information system must be based
on a single, rigorous, comprehensive and suitably tailored personnel process. The personnel information system will be a
seamless component of the defence enterprise system, enhancing effectiveness, efficiency, economy and integrity and providing
(inter alia):
a. Real-time personnel information.
b. Real-time fault diagnostics.
c. Optimal personnel data integrity.
d. Automated personnel accounting.
e. Automated personnel reporting.
f. Personnel administration.
g. Personnel payments.
h. Military education, training and development
enablement.
i. Interfacing with other corporate and national information systems
j. Work scheduling.

48. The personnel information technology system will support the total value chain of personnel management processes
(workflow) and includes the implementation of a new generation electronic capability that:
a. Focuses on business process requirements.
b. Automates the bulk of repetitive tasks and eliminates
waste in the process.
c. Significantly reduces reliance on paper-based
operations.


-----

d. Simplifies application processes at client level, ensuring effective data validation at the point of entry.

###### ACQUISITION OF DEFENCE PERSONNEL

49. Defence will pursue improved marketing, recruitment,
selection and appointment processes for all its service systems.
The annual recruitment of personnel will be driven by the approved defence establishment table, personnel turnover tendencies and the specific requirements of corps and musterings.
To prevent excessive growth of the Regular component, annual
intakes must be based on the annual attrition rate.

50. Targeted country-wide recruitment campaigns, designed
to meet the rejuvenation requirements of both the Regular and
Reserve components, will focus on: a balance between rural
and urban areas; top scholars from both secondary and tertiary
education institutions; and building awareness amongst youth in
specific target areas.

51. In order to ensure that the personnel quality base is appropriate and meets the profile requirements, recruitment will
be executed in a decentralised manner by Combat Services and
Staff Divisions. A pool of professional recruiters will be established per combat service. In some exceptional instances recruitment may be decentralised to unit level, particularly so in the
instance of extremely specialised environments and the Reserve
units.

52. Recruited members will adhere to the health, age, fitness,
intellectual and other standards of the Defence Force, and as
may be appropriate to the specific corps or mustering.

53. Focused and directed recruitment of young men and
women with leadership attributes will be key to the effectiveness
of the future Defence Force. To this end:
a. Appropriate selection criteria and instruments will
be used that focus on the candidate’s leadership
abilities.
b. A dedicated officer selection programme will be
established.
c. The priority for the recruitment of potential leaders
will lie with those candidates already in possession of
a tertiary qualification. A grade 12 exemption certificate will however be the minimum requirement to
enter the system as an officer cadet.

54. The post profile of the non-leader group will determine
the minimum academic qualifications as this may vary between
musterings.

55. This will be augmented by the direct probationary appointment of qualified professionals into the Regular and Reserve
components. To this end the University Reserve Training Pro

gramme, as part of the Reserve Training System, will be used to
acquire specialist and scarce skills.

56. Annual and separate intakes will feed the Regular and Reserve components respectively.

###### DEFENCE CAREER MANAGEMENT

57. Career management will be managed by the Combat Services and Staff Divisions through a standardised career management process that aligns organisational requirements with individual career development or progression. Defence will ensure
clear career-pathing and development programmes per mustering and speciality. To this end, a clearly defined corps (or mustering) post profile and person profile will support the career management process, including the identification of stages for exiting
the Defence Force.

58. The quality of defence personnel will be enhanced through
dedicated remunerative and non-remunerative initiatives to acquire and retain scarce skills. Academic qualifications and scarce
skills in both the Regular and Reserve components will be recognised and incentivised.

59. The following principles will be pursued to enhance defence career management:
a. Career and succession planning promotes the transfer of skills and competencies.
b. A synergetic relationship is created between individual career plans and workplace skill plans with individuals taking co-responsibility for their own career
management and development.
c. Career paths are effectively communicated and individual career plans are regularly updated and compiled in consultation with the member or employee.
d. Succession plans are available two years in advance.
e. Commanders and line managers are actively involved in the career management process.

###### MAINTENANCE OF DEFENCE PERSONNEL

60. The effective retention of defence personnel requires an
established and comprehensive day-to-day personnel maintenance system. To this end the following principles will be
pursued:
a. Defence personnel processes both support and are
informed by the defence regulatory framework and
defence personnel policies.
b. Defence members are supported by an accessible
personnel maintenance system. To this end:
i. E-personnel will be pursued.
ii. Individual personnel transactions will be executed promptly and accurately.


-----

iii. High-volume and repetitive personnel transactions are performed against a measurable
standard.
iv. Pro-active personnel processes and transactions are executed where possible and
applicable.
c. A zero tolerance on negative audit findings is
maintained.

###### DEFENCE PERSONNEL SEPARATION

61. The Defence Force will be maintained as a young, healthy
and fit organisation. Due to its unique composition, the Defence Force cannot offer a life-long career to all of its members.
Defence members will therefore be afforded opportunities
throughout their defence career to prepare and qualify themselves for a second career as useful citizens in the mainstream
economy of South Africa. Personnel separation will thus be integrally linked with a defence member’s career pathway and
associated service contract.

62. A dignified, attractive exit mechanism will be developed
to provide the process of severance with members at specified career gateways. Notwithstanding, and for a variety of reasons, the services of certain defence members may be required
for a period that surpasses their designated retirement age. An
amendment to the Defence Act (Act No 42 of 2002) and a
consequent policy system are required whereby the services of
such defence members may be extended with the approval of
the Minister as the Executive Authority.

63. A government-wide mechanism must be found to exit
members who no longer meet their post profile requirements
due to age, health, fitness or competence standards. This may
include:
a. Being exited in a dignified and sensitive manner.
b. The transfer to other government departments
where such members may be more effectively
utilised.
c. Ongoing support to such members in their transition and exit.

64. Personnel separation will be decentralised to the combat
services. The following principles will be pursued in the separation of defence personnel:
a. Defence maintains a system to prepare defence
members for their transition to a second career
(Transition Assistance Programme) through assisted
labour market entry at identified exit stages.
b. Placement assistance offices and other mechanisms
and agencies assist defence members in finding employment opportunities.


65. A seamless migration from the Regular component to the
Reserve component must be ensured. On separation, defence
members may volunteer to be retained as members of the Reserve component, in which they are available for service on a
part-time basis, or move to the membership of the military veterans and are placed on the National Reserve.

###### WIDER SPECTRUM OF DEFENCE ‘RANK AND SCALE’

66. In order to prevent the natural tendency of ‘rank inflation’,
salary will be decoupled from rank and a far broader salary scale
will be implemented in each rank.

###### COMPREHENSIVE HEALTH PROGRAMME

67. In as much as government has a responsibility to maintain
a healthy force, individual defence members have a corresponding responsibility to meet the health and fitness requirements of
the Defence Force. To this end, the Defence Force shall institute
a revised comprehensive health programme whereby biannual
health assessments are conducted with all members, regardless
of age or rank. Bearing in mind gender, age and matters such as
disabilities, each defence member shall:
a. Undergo a fitness evaluation.
b. Undergo a body mass index evaluation.

68. The standards for the above shall be set in regulations.
Defence members not complying to the set standard will be
given opportunity to remedy any non-compliance. Continual
non-compliance will result in dismissal from the Defence Force.

69. In addition to the above, the involvement of defence
members in sport and allied activities shall be encouraged as a
further mechanism toward maintaining the health of the force.
a. As part of the professionalisation of the physical training, sport and recreation function, it is proposed that
the Defence Force establishes a sports capability or
sports regiment, which will be a high-performance,
professional capability. This will be part of a retention and development strategy for athletes from disadvantaged backgrounds who have the potential to
develop into Olympic-level athletes. This requires
dedicated funding from National Treasury based on
collaboration between the Defence Force, Sport
and Recreation South Africa (SRSA) and the South
African Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee (SASCOC).
b. Establishment of this capability will enhance the
capacity of the Defence Force to engage communities in developmental initiatives such as the promotion of youth development through leadership
programmes centred on sports, physical education,


-----

adventure and recreation. The qualified services of
sport officers and physical training instructors would
be instrumental in presenting youth and cadet camps.
This will serve to enhance social cohesion and also
to “grow own wood”.

###### PERSONNEL PRIORITIES

70. **Personnel short-term priorities:**
a. **Personnel Information System. Implementa-**
tion of a single personnel information system.
b. **Service Systems. Establish service systems that**
sustain the feeder system of both the Regular and
Reserve components.
c. **Recruitment and Appointments Across**
**Career.**
i. Appoint only specialist and qualified persons in
posts, other than learner/student posts (correct mustering and qualification). Unsuitably
qualified serving personnel to be placed supernumerary if no suitable post is available.
ii. Personnel Service Code (PSC) to allow appointment of trainee civilian engineers and
technicians once they have applied for Engineering Council of South Africa registration.
d. **Remuneration.**
i. Establish sustained non-remunerative measures that support defence member retention.
ii. Establish remuneration conditions of services
and benefits that reflect the uniqueness of the
military and which are aligned with market
trends.
iii. Establish a flexible remuneration system that
makes provision for broad-banding and limits
rank inflation by de-linking rank from salary.
e. **Exit Mechanisms.**
i. Establish a ‘rank-age policy’, linked to corps
and mustering requirements, that directs individual career paths and exit stages of defence
members.
ii. Introduce longer minimum ‘time in rank’ for
senior officers across all race groups. Establish
and map career paths that identify specific appointments en route to senior appointments.
This must be applied within a career progression pyramid system at ages 30, 40 and 50.
This is for the Regular component only.
iii. Establish an attractive exit mechanism, including an appropriate benefit structure, to support
the exiting of defence members at identified
points.

2 Defence Act, 2002 (Act No 42 of 2002), Section 53.


iv. Introduce a system whereby redundant/uneconomical personnel can exit.
v. Ammend the Defence Act (Act 42 of 2002),
and establish a policy to facilitate, on approval
by the Minister, the continued service of certain defence personnel past their designated
retirement date.
vi Align personnel with the approved establishment tables and reduce supernumeraries to
approximately 2%.
f. **Training of Commanders. Introduce a “function-**
al command and management” course for non-selfaccounting and accounting units that must be completed prior to taking up a command appointment.

71. Personnel **longer-term priorities:**
a. The inadequate and fragmented defence personnel
management strategy, policy and system must be repositioned to provide adequate personnel strategic
direction to the support of the defence mission, strategic goals and strategic tasks.
b. On-going review of personnel delegations.
c. On-going simplification of personnel processes and
the elimination of non-value-adding activities in the
execution of personnel management.
d. Reintroduction of specialist personnel practitioner
training at all levels to ensure efficient, effective and
economical personnel management.

##### THE RESERVE COMPONENT OF THE ‘ONE FORCE’

###### REQUIREMENT

72. The Reserve component as contemplated in the Defence
Act[2] will be an integral element of the ‘one force’ and will be
optimised to deliver assured capabilities for all defence goals and
tasks.

73. The Reserves will provide a cost-effective mechanism for
capacitating the Defence Force for operational surges, sustainment of protracted operations and major combat operations as
well as providing specialist and scarce skills not normally found
in defence. Reserves will also serve at all levels of command and
management.

###### TENETS

74. The Reserve component will harness the widest pool of
societal talent for defence and will uphold a volunteer ethos. It
will be sustained by formal governance mechanisms and safe

-----

guards and be appropriately and equitably resourced.

75. The Reserve component will be integral to the design and
structure of the Services as well as their development trajectories. As such, Reserves may also be constituted as fully fledged
stand-alone design or structure elements under command of
a higher order single Service or joint headquarters. Extensive
use will be made of Reserves in all staff divisions at all levels of
the Defence Force. The Reserves will provide a cost-effective
specialist and scarce-skill capacity to the Defence Force.

76. Whilst the Reserves are part of the ‘one force’, their management will be approached and tailored with an understanding of their unique and specific requirements. In the final outcome, however, the Reserves will conform in every respect to
the professional military competency required of their Regular
counterparts.

77. Reserve units will be spread throughout South Africa so as
to enable access to reserve service by citizens in both urban and
rural areas. Reserve units will also provide a platform for the
Defence Force to contribute to ordered developmental tasks.
Specialist skills vested in the Reserves will be applied internally,
as ordered, to the developmental needs of urban, peri-urban
and rural communities, and to external post-conflict reconstruction and development operations.

###### PROGRAMMING AND BUDGETING

78. The Reserve component will be formally provided for
within the defence programmes and sub-programmes, with
funding linked to specific outcomes. These outcomes are to be
quantified as measurable targets for each Service and Division
and will be reflected in strategic and annual performance plans
as well as in the performance agreements of commanders.

79. The relative size of the Reserve component remains dependent on the strategic situation but, nonetheless, must be
able to meet the required development trajectory capacity requirements and the capacity forecast requirements for operations and other defence tasks and activities. The Reserves will
therefore be organised, staffed, equipped, trained and maintained at appropriate levels of readiness.

80. The Reserve component will be quantified by means of an
establishment table and a post structure that will be reflected on
the defence structure management system, enabling costing and
resource allocations in accordance with readiness requirements.

81. Personnel acquisition for the Reserves will be provided at
Service-level by programmes that include the following: an initial
military intake stream focused on recruitment of South African


youth; focused direct recruitment of professionals and specialists; a University Reserve Training System at tertiary education
institutions; and the translation of members leaving the Regulars
as well as members from the former statutory and non-statutory forces that volunteer to join the Reserve component.

82. The training outcomes required by the overarching defence education, training and development system will remain
equally relevant for the Reserve and Regular components.
However, the methodology used in achieving the same will be
structured and delivered in a manner that caters for Reserveunique aspects.

83. Measures will be taken to involve business and state entities in assisting young reservists with employment opportunities.
Vocational skills development in collaboration with the Sector
Training Authorities (SETAs) and job placement of the members
will be an on-going activity. This will be decentralised to Servicelevel with outsourcing contracts awarded to reputable companies that specialise in these services.

84. Additional supporting legislation to enhance the Reserve
service system, including an update of the moratorium clauses in
legislation to protect members from discrimination by employers and legislation that enables employer benefits for supporting
Reserve service, will be reviewed, amended, developed and
promulgated.


##### DEFENCE LOGISTICS SYSTEM


###### REQUIREMENT

85. Defence logistics is the integrated series of processes required to ensure the availability of matériel, facilities and services, as well as the movement of matériel and personnel, in
support of defence operations from the 5[th] to the 1[st] line of
combat service support.
a. This requires enhanced logistics interoperabil**ity, based on the establishment of a single integrat-**
ed logistic information system and a single defence
logistics process.
b. It implies vertical alignment with national and departmental direction and governance, and **hori-**
**zontal integration across the Defence Force, with**
a special emphasis on integration over the supply
chain and lifecycle management of systems and
assets.

86. Definitions. The following nomenclature is used in the
context indicated hereunder:
a. **Support. Manage defence capabilities throughout**
their total lifecycle.


-----

b. **Sustain. Maintain defence operating capabilities**
over a period of time.
c. **Maintenance.** Repair, servicing and overhaul of
defence equipment to ensure it is in a serviceable
condition to satisfy operating requirements.
d. **Maintain Defence Reserves. Ensure the avail-**
ability of resources (equipment and personnel) of
appropriate quality and quantity as per reserve stock
policy.

###### DEFENCE LOGISTICS SYSTEM

87. A single, comprehensive and rigorous logistic system will
be established that can be tailored to requirements and is capable of delivering combat service support to both internal and
external operations in accordance with defence combat service
support doctrine.

88. The logistic system must:
a. Enable force provisioning, force preparation and
force employment through the provision of appropriate, ready and sustained logistics.
b. Enable jointness and interoperability.
c. Provide combat service support on a joint and multinational basis, yet recognising the uniqueness of systems operating on land, in the air, at sea and in the
military health domain.
d. Integrate supply chain management, asset
management,[3] lifecycle management and quality
management perspectives.
e. Consolidate reporting and planning.
f. Create a common Defence Force logistics language.

89. The system must further:
a. Support local, distant, dispersed and extended
operations.
b. Support participation in international operations.
c. Accord equal priority to all defence strategic goals
and strategic tasks.
d. Comply with the national regulatory framework,
government priorities, internal governance and
stakeholder requirements.
e. Maximise logistic outputs while minimising costs.
f. Reduce logistics risk.

###### DIRECT DEFENCE LOGISTICS

90. Strategic direction for defence logistics will be centralised,
while logistics execution will be decentralised. Defence logistics
will be institutionalised as a command function, with full responsi
3 Includes movable, immovable and intangible inventory.


bility, accountability and authority being fixed by clear delegation
to the lowest appropriate level, supported by a comprehensive
defence enterprise system.

91. The Chief of the Defence Force’s logistics staff are responsible to plan, orchestrate, direct and control logistics through,
inter alia, the provision of logistic policy, doctrine, functional and
competency standards and standardisation and training curricula.
This will be achieved through:
a. Integrated planning, consolidated reporting, internal
controls and risk management.
b. Determining logistic output objectives and directing
strategic resource allocation.
c. Managing common-use systems by a single point of
responsibility so as to achieve efficiency and economy
of scale through standardisation and consolidation.
d. Ensuring reserves for common commodities.
e. Positioning the defence industry, the private sector
and defence institutes to support both defence lifecycle and supply chain management.
f. Determining strategic, operational and tactical reserve stock levels through a risk-based approach to
ensure that the characteristics of demand and supply
are affordably reconciled.
g. Supplying strategic direction to the execution of
logistics.

###### EXECUTE DEFENCE LOGISTICS

92. Combat services, combat support services and units at all
levels will execute logistics. Logistic support capabilities will be
embedded up to the unit level, but will not extend to sub-unit
and sub-sub-unit level. Logistic and financial delegations, organisational capabilities and information systems will be cascaded to
the lowest appropriate levels within the Defence Force, but not
beyond unit level.

93. Logistic support will be executed as follows:
a. 5[th] line logistic support from the national or international defence industry or through the National
Reserve.
b. 4[th] line deeper level logistic support from defence
logistic depots and logistic units.
c. 3[rd] line deployable support, including forward basing in the communication zone. (Typically at combat
division level.)
d. 2[nd] line intermediate support in the theatre. (Typically
at brigade level.)
e. 1[st] line organisational support from the units’ own internal support structures. (Typically at battalion level.)


-----

94. Commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) and military-off-theshelf (MOTS) must be the first-order consideration in both
acquisition and procurement. A pragmatic approach based on
local procurement will be applied whenever it is the most costefficient method.

###### DEFENCE LOGISTICS DOCTRINE

95. Logistics doctrine will be informed by the defence mission, goals and tasks. Logistics doctrine will be based on defence
doctrine and will deliver a single, rigorous, comprehensive logistics process, founded on best practice military logistics principles
and philosophy.

###### DEFENCE LOGISTICS INFORMATION SYSTEM

96. The logistics information system will be a seamless component of the defence enterprise system. The logistics information system will enhance effectiveness, efficiency, economy and
integrity in the logistics system, providing (inter alia):
a. A proactive ‘push logistics’ approach from depots to
operational areas.
b. Real-time inventory and asset tracking.
c. Real-time fault diagnostics.
d. Optimal logistic data integrity.
e. Automated logistic accounting.
f. Automated logistic reporting.
g. Asset and inventory management aligned with national prescripts.
h. Supply chain management.
i. Item identification and codification.
j. Interactive and tracked electronic, technical and
other documentation.
k. Interfacing with other corporate and national information systems.
l. Work scheduling.

###### LOGISTICS EXPERTISE

97. The logistician’s role is to analyse the mission of the force,
calculate the requirements and determine how to meet the
support requirements, advise the commander on the feasibility of alternative courses of action, support the commander’s
selected course of action to the highest level possible, and warn
the commander in time when this support is not possible.

98. The complexity and diversity of the logistic function require a wide variety of professional and specialist lifecycle and
supply chain management personnel. Most of these are scarce
skills and therefore specific measures will be taken to ensure


their availability, including remunerative and non-remunerative
means as well as intensive education, training and development
programmes.

99. Special focus will be placed on ensuring the availability of
appropriate, quality and competent logisticians through attracting, recruiting, educating, training, developing, retaining, motivating, correctly deploying and eventually redeploying sufficient
competent logistics members.

###### DEFENCE LOGISTICS PRIORITIES

100. Logistics **short-term priorities.**
a. **Logistics Information System. Implementation**
of a single logistics information system as a seamless
component of the broader defence enterprise system as the first and primary intervention.
b. **Interim Measures. In the immediate absence of**
the single logistic information system, and to the
best extent possible, enhance:
i. Logistic reporting, with particular reference to
tangible capital assets, contingent liabilities and
the understatement of accruals in the financial
statements.
ii. The Defence Asset Register for both moveable and immoveable assets.
iii. The Defence Lease Register.
iv. The management of Defence Force assets
in both foreign deployments and embassies,
with specific reference to establishing procedures concerning procurement, sustainment
and disposal in the foreign country and the accounting and reporting thereof.
v. Supply chain management and the elimination
of non-coherent practices.
c. Introduce an operational supply support process.
d. Dispose of surplus, redundant and unserviceable
ammunition to improve safety and reduce fruitless
accounting, warehousing and labour costs.
e. Dispose of surplus, redundant and unserviceable
equipment stock to reduce the cost of capital and
reduce fruitless accounting, warehousing and labour
costs.
f. Acquire, as a matter of principle, commercial and
military-off-the-shelf solutions as opposed to designed-to-purpose solutions.
g. Increase equipment serviceability ratios through
channelled increased funds to the operating budget,
establishing more service contracts with industry
and the recapitalisation of maintenance and repair
institutions.


-----

h. Migration from cash-based accounting to accrual
accounting, including asset management up to unit
level for moveable and immoveable assets.
i. Devolve logistics management and procurement
delegations and accountability to combat services
and staff divisions to the lowest extent possible.
j. Establish a quality logistic governance, risk and compliance process.
k. Accreditation of all functional logistic training
institutions.
l. Intervention to both enhance the training of Regular
logisticians and to draw on Reserve logisticians, followed by the continuous improvement of the skills
and capacity of logisticians throughout the Defence
Force, retention of scarce skills and the development
of all logistic personnel.

101. Logistics **long-term priorities.**
a. The inadequate and fragmented defence logistics strategy, policy and system must be urgently
addressed.
b. Internal capabilities and priority funding must be
channelled and developed to halt and roll-back the
disrepair of defence prime mission equipment, defence facilities and infrastructure.
c. Implement best-practice military supply chain and
lifecycle management founded on a single logistic
management information system.
d. Reduce Defence Force exposure to safety, health,
environmental and quality risks which constrain operational sovereignty and lead to increased compliance or litigation costs.
e. Renew logistic capabilities, organisation, equipment,
reserves, doctrine and knowledge.

###### DEFENCE PROCUREMENT

 Defence Procurement Policy and Doctrine

102. The defence procurement system is a critical component
of the defence logistic system and as such is a key resource area
that will contribute to the effective, efficient and transparent
spending of the defence budget.

103. Procurement policy and doctrine will be informed by the
defence mandate, goals and tasks. The defence procurement
policy and doctrine will be based on higher-order defence policy
and doctrine and will deliver a single, robust, comprehensive,
inclusive, transparent procurement process.

104. The defence procurement system must be capacitated and
capable of delivering a defence procurement policy and doctrine


(including research and development) that ensure compliance
with governance and auditing requirements.

###### Definition of Defence Procurement

105. Defence procurement is the complete process of acquiring or obtaining personnel, matériel, services, or property from
outside the Defence Force (by means authorised in pertinent
directives) in support of operational requirements. It includes
negotiating, contracting and purchasing.

###### Defence Procurement Requirement

106. Defence procurement will be managed in the manner
as prescribed in the Public Finance Management Act, 1999 (as
amended) and the Treasury Regulations (as amended). Defence
procurement specifically is responsible to:
a. Establish a single, comprehensive, tailorable and
robust procurement system that is capable of delivering fair, competitive, transparent, equitable and
cost-effective procurement support to both internal
and external operations in accordance with defence
combat service support doctrine within the 5[th] to the
1[st] line of support.
b. Ensure that goods and services are procured and
made readily available for defence officials to execute
their respective roles and to dispose of inventory no
longer required. Only certain defence officials shall
be authorised and responsible to procure the required goods and services and/or sell goods no longer required.

107. The defence procurement system must achieve the following objectives:
a. Consolidate procurement planning, execution, control and reporting.
b. Enable force provisioning and re-provisioning, force
preparation and force employment through the application of appropriate procurement services at all
levels within defence.
c. Support local, distant and dispersed operations over
extended lines of communication, including international operations.
d. Accord equal priority to all defence goals and tasks.
e. Achieve effectiveness, efficiency and economy in all
procurement practices by:
i. Strengthening of governance, risk, compliance
and accountability (GRCA) processes that address the ethical and fiduciary prescripts.
ii. Enabling Services and Divisions to function
effectively through all phases of defence procurement, including: planning, execution,


-----

controlling, reporting and accounting and
compliance to broad-based black economic
empowerment imperatives.
iii. Providing an inclusive multi-disciplinary procurement service to procure quality products
and services at the best value cost.

108. When urgent operational requirements so dictate, the
Defence Force must be given the latitude to take certain decisions which may deviate from national legislation. In instances
when this is justified, condonement from the relevant approval
authorities, such as National Treasury and the Auditor General,
must be obtained.

109. Defence will report to National Treasury on defence procurement and the payment of suppliers.

###### Direct Defence Procurement

110. Strategic direction for the defence procurement management system will be centralised, while procurement execution
will be decentralised to all Services and Divisions. Defence
procurement will be institutionalised as a command function,
with full responsibility, accountability and authority being fixed by
clear delegation to the lowest appropriate level, supported by a
comprehensive and integrated defence enterprise system.

111. The Chief of the Defence Force’s logistics staff are responsible to plan, orchestrate, direct and control procurement
through, inter alia, the provision of procurement policy, doctrine, functional and competency standards and training curricula. This will be achieved through:
a. Integrated planning, consolidated reporting, internal
controls and risk management.
b. Determining procurement output objectives and
directing strategic resource allocation in conjunction
with Service and Division Chiefs.
c. Managing common-user systems by means of a single point of responsibility so as to achieve efficiency
and economy of scale through standardisation and
consolidation.
d. Positioning the defence industry, the private sector
and defence institutes to support defence supplychain, lifecycle procurement and procurement
management.
e. Procuring strategic, operational and tactical reserve
stock levels through a risk-based approach to ensure that the characteristics of demand and supply
are reconciled and managed efficiently, effectively
and economically.
f. Supplying strategic procurement direction to the
Services and Divisions.


###### Execute Defence Procurement

112. Services and Divisions will execute procurement. Procurement support capabilities will be embedded down to unit
level, but will not extend to sub-unit and sub-sub-unit levels.
Procurement delegations, organisational capabilities and information systems will be cascaded to the lowest appropriate levels within the Defence Force, but not below unit level.

113. Procurement support will be executed as follows and values are reflected in 2014 Rand terms and will be amended from
time to time:
a. 5[th] line procurement support from National
Treasury.
b. Extended 4th line deeper level procurement support to a delegated financial ceiling of R50m.
c. 4[th] line deeper level procurement support from the
Central Procurement Service Centre (CPSC) and
the Simon’s Town Procurement Service Centre
(SPSC) with a delegated financial ceiling of R10m.
d. 3[rd] line intermediate deployable support, including
forward basing in the communication zone from the
Services’ procurement units with a delegated financial ceiling of R5m.
e. 2[nd] line intermediate support in theatre from relevant support bases with a delegated financial ceiling
of R1m.
f. 1[st] line organisational support from the units’ own
internal support structures with a delegated financial
ceiling of R500 000,00.

114. For common sustainment, COTS requirements must
be the first order consideration in the procurement process.
MOTS can be considered in the second order. Bespoke (custom configuration) requirements for goods and services should
always be the last option in the procurement process.

115. A pragmatic approach based on local procurement will be
applied whenever it is the most efficient, effective and economic
method. This does NOT necessarily mean the cheapest option in all cases. This approach will further enable and enhance
the Defence Force’s contribution to the national developmental
agenda.

116. Whilst transversal contracts are concluded by National
Treasury, non-delivery or poor delivery impacts severely on the
conducting of defence operations. Transversal contracts furthermore restrict the Defence Force’s contribution to the developmental agenda by limiting the goods and services that may be
procured locally. The Defence Force requires a special dispensation from National Treasury so as to be able to guarantee the
integrity of its operations and at the same time fully support its
contribution to the developmental agenda.

###### Defence Procurement Information System

117. The procurement information system will be a seamless
and integrated component of the defence enterprise system.
The procurement information system will enhance effectiveness,
efficiency, economy, transparency, integrity and simplicity in the
procurement system, and will address:
a. A ‘forward procurement’ approach.
b. Real-time procurement systems and procurement
process monitoring.
c. Real-time fault diagnostics.
d. Optimal procurement data integrity.
e. Automated procurement accounting and auditing.
f. Automated procurement reporting.
g. Procurement management aligned with national
prescripts.
h. Supplier payment integrated with the supply chain
management system according to national prescripts.
i. Interactive and tracked electronic technical and other
documentation.
j. Interfacing with other corporate and national information systems.
k. Work scheduling.

118. It is therefore critical that the defence procurement information system is based on a single, rigorous, robust, comprehensive, integrated and tailorable procurement management
process.

119. Decentralised Execution.
a. Procurement will be a logistic function closely supported by finance for supplier payments.
b. Services and selected Divisions will establish their
own comprehensive procurement management capabilities down to unit level.
c. Services (including combat divisions, brigades, formations, bases and units) will manage and account
for their own procurement resources.
d. The functional command and control of procurement will be cascaded via the command line to the
lowest level (unit level; not to sub-unit, or sub-subunit level).
e. Collation of finance and procurement functions and
systems will be sought to expedite defence supplier
payments.

###### Defence Procurement Expertise

120. Due to the primary object of defence procurement being
that of in-theatre support, the majority of defence procurement
officials should be military personnel.


121. The complexity and diversity of the defence procurement
system requires a wide variety of professional and specialist
procurement management personnel. Most of these skills are
scarce and specific, not only to defence, but also nationally and
globally. Specific measures will therefore be introduced, including remunerative (occupation-specific dispensation) and non-remunerative methods, and intensive education, training and development programmes, to ensure their availability and correct
placement.

122. Functional procurement training will be established for the
education and training of procurement officials along a dedicated
procurement learning path within the defence logistics career
path. This training must be a continuous process to ensure capacitated and professional defence procurement practitioners.

123. Performance agreements for procurement personnel will
follow the line of command.

###### Defence Procurement Priorities

124. Defence procurement short-term priorities.
a. Implementation of a single procurement management information system as a seamless component
of the broader defence enterprise system.
b. **Interim Measures. In the immediate absence**
of the single procurement information system,
enhance:
i. Procurement reporting, with particular reference to the procurement and payment of assets and contingent liabilities.
ii. The Defence Procurement Register for the
procurement and payment of both moveable
and immoveable assets.
iii. The management of the procurement of Defence Force assets in both foreign deployments
and embassies, with specific reference to establishing procedures concerning procurement and disposal in foreign countries and the
logistic and financial accounting and reporting
thereof.
iv. Devolve procurement management, delegations and accountability to combat Services
and Divisions to the lowest appropriate level.
v. The establishment of organisational procurement structures with qualified procurement
personnel to capacitate the Chief of the Defence Force and commanders at all levels
to control defence resources and account
therefore.
vi. Rolling out a comprehensive system of procurement delegations to the lowest appropriate level in the Defence Force.


-----

vii. Establish a quality procurement governance,
risk and compliance process.
viii. Intervention both to enhance the training of
defence procurement personnel and to draw
on qualified Reserve component procurement personnel, followed by the continuous improvement of the skills and capacity of
procurement personnel throughout the Defence Force, retention of scarce skills and the
development of all defence procurement
personnel.

125. **Defence procurement long-term priorities.**
a. Implement best practice military procurement management founded on a single integrated procurement management information system that includes
the migration requirement to accrual accounting.
b. Establishment of the defence procurement regulatory framework.
c. Elimination of all adverse audit findings in the defence procurement environment.


##### DEFENCE FINANCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM


###### REQUIREMENT

126. Defence finance is a key resource area. The defence budget will be determined by the defence mission, goals and tasks.

127. A single, comprehensive, tailorable and rigorous finance
system will be established that is capable of delivering finance
support to both internal and external operations in accordance
with defence combat service support doctrine from the 5[th] to
the 1[st] line of support.

###### DEFENCE FINANCE MANAGEMENT

128. Defence finance will be managed in the manner prescribed
in the Public Finance Management Act, 1999 (as amended) and
the Treasury Regulations (as amended).

129. The finance management system must achieve the following objectives:
a. Enable force provisioning, force preparation and
force employment through the provision of appropriate finances.
b. Consolidate finance planning, execution, control
and reporting.
c. Support local, distant, dispersed and extended
operations as well as participation in international
operations.
d. Accord equal priority to all defence goals and tasks.


e. Achieve finance effectiveness, efficiency and economy where reasonably practicable.
f. Enable Services and Divisions to function effectively
through all phases of defence finance management,
including: planning, budgeting, execution, controlling, reporting and accounting.
g. Provide inclusive and quality multi-disciplinary products and services at the best possible value.

###### DIRECT DEFENCE FINANCE MANAGEMENT

130. Strategic direction for defence finance management will
be centralised, while finance execution will be decentralised.
Defence finance management will be institutionalised as a command function, with full responsibility, accountability and authority being fixed by clear delegation to the lowest appropriate level, supported by a comprehensive defence enterprise system.

131. The Chief of the Defence Force’s finance staff are responsible to assist the Chief of the Defence Force in discharging finance management duties, including: the exercise of sound
budgeting and budgetary control practices; the operation of
internal finance controls; and the timely production of finance
reports.

132. The Chief of the Defence Force’s finance staff are responsible to plan, orchestrate, direct and control defence finance
management through, inter alia, the provision of finance policy,
doctrine, functional and competency standards and standardisation and training curricula. This will be achieved through:
a. Integrated planning, consolidated reporting, internal
controls and risk management.
b. Determining finance output objectives and directing
strategic resource allocation.

133. The Chief of the Defence Force’s finance staff are responsible for providing the Chief of the Defence Force with integrated staff oversight and control related to:
a. The Defence Force estimate of expenditure for
programmes assigned to the Defence Force.
b. The Defence Force allocation.
c. Defence Force finance reports.
d. Defence Force financial statements.
e. Contributing to defence submissions to Treasury.
f. Ensuring the veracity of any Defence Force finance

m. Defence Force supplier payments.
n. Defence Force finance control services.
o. Defence Force finance accounting services.
p. Submission of Defence Force virements within the
Defence Force programme structure.

###### EXECUTE DEFENCE FINANCE MANAGEMENT

134. Decentralised Execution.
a. Services and Divisions will establish own comprehensive finance management capabilities in accordance with the defence staff system.
b. Combat services and units at all levels will manage
and account for own finance resources.
c. Such finance management capabilities will be embedded up to the unit level, but will not extend to
sub-unit and sub-sub-unit level.
d. The functional control of finance will cascade to the
lowest level via the staff line.

135. Procurement.
a. Greater co-location of finance and procurement will
be sought to expedite defence supplier payments.
b. Procurement will be a logistics function, of which finance will control supplier payments.
c. Logistic and finance delegations, organisational capabilities and information systems will be cascaded
to the lowest appropriate levels within the Defence
Force, but not below unit level. This requires that
the delegations framework for logistics and finance
be revisited to effectively support the concept.

136. Finance as a Combat Service Support Function.
Defence finance management will be executed as follows:
a. 5[th] line finance management support from National Treasury, the Reserve Bank and other financial
institutions.
b. 4[th] line deeper level finance support from the
Chief Staff Finance and finance staffs at Services and
Divisions.
c. 3[rd] line deployable finance management, including
forward positioning in the communication zone.
(Typically at division level.)
d. 2[nd] line intermediate finance management in the theatre. (Typically at brigade level.)
e. 1[st] line organisational support from the unit’s own
finance management support structures. (Typically at
battalion level.)


###### DEFENCE FINANCE MANAGEMENT DOCTRINE

137. Defence finance management doctrine will be informed
by the defence mission and the spectrum of the strategic goals
and strategic tasks. Finance management doctrine shall be based
on defence doctrine and shall deliver a single, rigorous, comprehensive finance management process, founded on best practice
military finance principles and philosophy.

138. A finance concept of operations must be established for
campaign planning.

###### DEFENCE FINANCE INFORMATION SYSTEM

139. The defence finance information system will be a seamless
component of the wider defence enterprise system, providing
reliable real-time finance information, technology, networking
and automation. The defence finance information system will
enhance effectiveness, efficiency, economy and integrity in the
financial system, providing (inter alia):
a. Real-time finance management.
b. Real-time fault diagnostics.
c. Optimal finance data integrity.
d. Automated finance accounting.
e. Automated finance reporting.
f. Personnel payments aligned with national prescripts.
g. Supplier payment integrated with supply chain
management.
h. Interactive and tracked electronic, technical and other documentation.
i. Interfacing with other corporate and national information systems
j. Work scheduling.

140. It is critical that the future defence finance information system is based on a single, rigorous, comprehensive and tailorable
finance management process.

###### FINANCE EXPERTISE

141. Establishment of a Finance Corps. The defence finance management system is a core component of the defence
combat service support which must be provided from the 5[th] line
to the 1[st] line within the theatre of operations. This necessitates
that the vast majority of defence finance officials are militarised.
To this end:
a. The intent is to re-establish a uniformed finance capability within the Defence Force as a deployable
corps in support of successful defence operations.


-----

b. A Finance Corps must be established with its unique
personnel management and personnel development systems. A Corps Director will be established.
Further corps managers will be established at the
Service level, including being the finance capability
manager for the particular service.
c. A Personnel Management Code (PMC) for finance
must be established to manage finance officials.
d. Finance functional training, alongside defence formative and military training, will be established whereby finance officials will be educated and trained in
the functional areas identified within a finance learning path focused on defence finance management
practises and processes.
e. To this end, all previous military finance practitioners,[4]
irrespective of current mustering, must be offered
the opportunity to militarise. This must be extended
to include defence civilians with “CA” suffix currently
serving in the Financial Management Division as finance functionaries.
f. A needs-analysis must be conducted to determine
the military, formative and functional training required by members militarising. Such training must
be built into the established career paths of members, without prejudice to the affected individuals.
g. The militarisation of the finance capability must be
underpinned by addressing the contractual relationship of the Defence Force with such members, including, but not limited to: career-pathing, pension,
group-life insurance, medical benefits and salary
notches.
h. Those that do not wish to militarise may remain in
the finance management system or their otherwise
current career path outside of the finance corps as
defence civilian employees.
i. A Finance Corps Reserve component must be established to support the Defence Force’s standing
and surge capability.
j. Finance practitioners providing a financial management service to the Defence Secretariat will primarily be civilian but military finance members may be
seconded to the Defence Secretariat.

142. Performance agreements for finance functionaries will follow the line of command.

143. Ensuring Appropriate Finance Personnel.
a. The future defence finance management system will
be reliant on specialist skills such as chartered accountants filling key posts. To this end:


i. An occupation specific dispensation will be
pursued to obtain and retain such specialist
staff, including remunerative and non-remunerative means as well as intensive education,
training and development programmes.
ii. Agreements will be entered into with educational institutions to develop capable defence
finance personnel into chartered accountants
through specific training interventions.
b. Specific measures will be taken to ensure sustained
availability of finance personnel, including remunerative and non-remunerative means as well as
intensive education, training and development
programmes.
c. Special focus will be placed on ensuring the availability of appropriate, competent finance officials
through attracting, recruiting, educating, training,
developing, retaining, motivating, correctly deploying and eventually redeploying sufficient competent
finance personnel.
d. The continuous staffing of the finance management
system will be achieved by rotating personnel within
the Services and Divisions.

###### DEFENCE FINANCE MANAGEMENT PRIORITIES

144. **Finance management short-term priorities.**
a. Implementation of a single comprehensive finance
management and control system as a seamless
component of the broader defence enterprise system. This must be fully integrated with the logistic
and procurement systems incorporating delegations to the lowest appropriate level in the Defence
Force so as to ensure eventual accrual accounting
compliance.
b. The establishment of organic finance structures and
finance personnel to capacitate the Chief of the Defence Force and commanders at all levels to control
defence resources and account therefore.
c. Rolling out a comprehensive system of finance, procurement and logistic delegations to the lowest appropriate level in the Defence Force.
d. The establishment of a Finance Corps.
e. Placing uniformed finance personnel where appropriate throughout the Defence Force.

145. Finance management long-term priorities:
a. Migration to the accrual financial system and
the complete adoption of the Standard Chart of
Accounts.


4 Meaning those defence members whose force number suffix changed from ‘PE’ to ‘CS’.


-----

b. Elimination of all adverse audit findings in the finance
field.
c. Establishment of the defence finance framework in
legislation.


between adversaries for the exploitation and
protection of information and communication systems. The protection of information
as a strategic resource places emphasis on the
requirement to develop a significant offensive
and defensive capability to exploit and defend
information systems.
ii. The defence information and communication
systems security architecture must be aligned
across all systems to consistently maintain
the confidentiality, integrity and availability of
information.
c. **Economic Optimisation.**
i. Defence information and communication systems must be centred on modern, technologically-advanced, efficient and effective, yet
affordable information and communication
technology capabilities. Such capabilities are
constrained by scarce financial resources and
thus emphasis will be placed on overall valuefor-money through administrative systems
based on proven technology.
ii. The development of shared defence information and communication systems will enjoy
precedence over the duplication of systems
with similar functionality. The emphasis will
thus fall on a common information and communication technology architecture.
iii. A balance between unique systems and COTS
and MOTS must inform procurement considerations, with specific emphasis being placed
on maintaining strategic capabilities and niche
technology competence. A pragmatic approach based on local procurement will be applied whenever it is feasible to do so.
d. **Enabling Command and Control & Manage-**
**ment Processes.**
i. Defence command and control and administrative information systems must provide accurate, relevant and timely information to all
levels of command during force preparation,
employment and support activities with respect to every sphere of military business.
ii. Information processing must synchronise and
replicate information between geographical
operational areas to maintain self-sustaining
operating environments.

149. **Unique Systems. Services and Divisions are responsible**
for the lifecycle management of own unique information and
communication technology service delivery, maintenance and
disposal.


##### DEFENCE INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION SYSTEM


###### REQUIREMENT

146. Defence information is a strategic resource over which the
Defence Force must exert complete control, ensure inviolable
security and maintain absolute autonomy, this from the 5[th] to
the 1[st] line of combat service support. Appropriate defence information and communication systems will be informed by the
defence mission, goals and tasks.

147. The concept of ‘information as a strategic resource’ will
drive all thinking on defence information management, hence
the use of the term “information resource management”.

###### DEFENCE INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION SYSTEM PRINCIPLES

148. Common Systems. Common defence information and
communication systems must be capable of delivering combat
service support to both internal and external operations in accordance with defence combat service support doctrine. To this
end the following principles will apply from the 5[th] to the 1[st] level
of combat service support:
a. **Access to Defence Information.**
i. Information and communication systems must
enable access to relevant defence information
required for the execution of functional tasks
securely and efficiently, and when and where
required by acquiring, accessing and distributing information to remote locations in a secure
manner. Efficient secure connectivity must be
established between sensors and military, corporate and common information and communication systems.
ii. Defence must maintain autonomy in terms of
providing access to its information and communications system infrastructure.
iii. Accurate, quality, non-duplicated and relevant
information must be available to authorised users in the correct form and format, and when
required.
b. **Information and Communication System**
**Security.**
i. An aspect of modern warfare is the use of nonlethal weapon capabilities which invoke battle


-----

###### DEFENCE INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION SYSTEM OBJECTIVES

150. **Information Resource Management. The manage-**
ment of information as a strategic resource extends to the planning, policy maintenance, strategic control and research and
development of integrated information management services,
including the lifecycle, archiving and configuration management
of information.

151. **Joint Information Systems Management. The**
concept of information as a strategic resource will drive future
information systems management. Defence information requirements will be translated into joint information systems and
infrastructure needed to meet such information requirements.

152. **Joint Information Warfare. Joint information warfare**
seeks to both defend own information and communication systems against attack and to adversely influence the opposing forces’ use of their information systems. Good information system
security protects own information systems against unauthorised
access, whilst offensive actions will adversely influence the opposing forces’ utilisation of information systems.

153. **Joint Information Communica-**
**tion Infrastructure Management.**
The management and technical support
of the defence information and communication infrastructure extend to the
lifecycle management of defence information product systems, technical support and interoperable, interconnected
and standardised information technology
infrastructure.

154. **Spectrum Management. Spec-**
trum management at an international
and a national level extends to the coordination of spectrum usage with entities
such as commercial spectrum users and
government institutions. This requires
efficient joint management of the radio
frequency spectrum within the Defence
Force.

155. **Integrated Information Sys-**
**tems. Information system integration**
extends across defence enterprise information system portfolios through centralised strategic control and integration of
defence enterprise information systems.


###### DEFENCE INFORMATION SYSTEMS FRAMEWORK AND STRATEGY

156. There are mandatory criteria and changes in the information and communication technology environment requiring an
appropriate defence governance, risk and compliance regime
conducive to the realisation of affordable and appropriate information and communication systems and technology.

157. A defence information and communication system interoperability framework must be established, maintained and
aligned to ensure connectivity between defence administrative
and command and control systems. Defence intellectual property related to the development of information and communication systems must be maintained and managed within this
framework.

158. The defence information and communication systems
strategy will address five strategic focus areas (Figure 14-4):
a. Optimised value of the defence information and
communication technology investment.
b. Effective information and communication
technology.


_Figure 14-4: Strategic Focus Areas of Defence Information and Communication_


-----

c. Integrated information and communication technology enablement.
d. Professional information and communication technology organisation.
e. Secure and protected information and communication technology.

159. The five strategic focus areas are of equal importance.

###### DIRECT COMMON DEFENCE INFORMA- TION AND COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS

160. Strategic direction for common defence information and
communication systems will be centralised, while the execution
will be decentralised. The Chief of the Defence Force’s ICS staff
are responsible to plan, orchestrate, direct and control common
defence information and communication systems through, inter
alia, the provision of logistic policy, doctrine, functional and competency standards and standardisation and training curricula. This
will be achieved through:
a. Computing and communication technology.
b. Enterprise management systems.
c. Network-enabled command and control systems.
d. Defensive and offensive information warfare.
e. Providing strategic direction for the execution of ICS.

###### EXECUTE COMMON DEFENCE INFORMA- TION AND COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS

161. Defence ICS support will be executed as follows:
a. 5[th] line information and communication systems support from the national or international commercial
sector or the defence.
b. 4[th] line deeper level information and communication
systems support from within the Defence Force.
c. 3[rd] line deployable support from the Information
and Communication Systems Command within the
communication zone. (Typically at combat division
level.)
d. 2[nd] line intermediate support from the Information
and Communication Systems Command in the theatre. (Typically at brigade level.)
e. 1[st] line organisational support from the units’ own internal support structures. (Typically at battalion level.)

162. The Chief of the Defence Force’s ICS staff will provide
common information and communication support transversely
across the Defence Force and will be the information and communication prime systems integrator for the Defence Force
across both common and universal/transverse systems. The staff
will provide the operational management of defence information


systems.

163. The Chief of the Defence Force’s ICS staff will further be
responsible for the management of records as prescribed by the
National Archives and Records Service of South Africa Act (Act
No 43 of 1996) as amended, specifically Section 13 provisions
regarding efficient records management in government, as well
as the National Archives and Records Service of South Africa
Regulations, Part V: Management of Records, which addresses
the specific parameters within which government bodies should
operate regarding the management of their records.


###### DEFENCE FACILITIES

164. In fulfilment of its constitutional obligations, Defence utilises
a large number of state facilities. This includes land for training
and research purposes and fixed assets such as buildings, roads
and runways for force preparation and employment. Defence is
consequently one of the largest users of property in South Africa
and controls land in each of the nine provinces. The defence
property requirement stems from its core functions and activities. This ranges from the larger training areas, Army bases, Air
Force bases and ammunition depots, to smaller properties such
as communication sites, shooting ranges and even remote observation posts of only a few square metres.

165. Government owns most facilities utilised by defence. Such
land is legally owned by the South African government with defence having a reservation of use, although the deeds are held
by the Department of Public Works as the national custodian of
all state land and facilities. Some defence land is defence dndowment property transferred from the government of the United
Kingdom in 1922, which is also classified as state land. Such
property is governed by an Act of Parliament (Defence Endowment Property and Account Act, Act No 33 of 1922). The remaining infrastructure is generally leased from the private sector.
Defence leases properties for shooting ranges, for forward airfields and for sites for the countrywide communication network.
Defence also has “rights of use” agreements with land owners
that allow certain land to be used for military purposes.

###### THE DEFENCE LAND REQUIREMENT

166. Defence currently has approximately 420 000 hectares of
land under its control. This includes the following general categories, each being in itself a significant consideration in determining
the size of defence properties. However, it should be noted that
more than one of these activities could take place on portions of
defence land:


##### THE DEFENCE FOOTPRINT


-----

a. **Training Combat Elements. The specific com-**
bat element and role for which training is required
(for example deployment of mechanised or motorised infantry in conventional, peace-support-operation or area-protection roles) will determine the
area of land needed to train the force. This means
that the area needed for training will be determined
by the combat elements (or combination of combat
elements) to be trained.
b. **Type of Training. The types of training to be**
conducted also have an effect on the area of land
needed for training. Smaller areas are required for
dry training, field craft training and vehicle training
than are required for training with live ammunition.
A variety of geographical features and veld types
should be present to simulate different scenarios
within which skills are to be acquired.
c. **Expansions in Force Design and Develop-**
**ment of new Weapon Systems. Provision must**
be made for expansions in force design and the development of new weapon systems.
d. **Spatial Implications of Safety Templates.**
The types of weapons and the combinations in
which they are deployed have a profound influence on the area of land required. The safety arc for
each weapon is clearly defined and must be strictly
adhered to. Such safety templates form an integral
part of any military area where armed training takes
place. The size of a military base where armed
training is performed is to a large extent determined
by the ammunition used in training and the linked
safety templates. The size of a military training area
usually increases with the use of higher order ammunition, which requires larger safety templates.
e. **Base Areas, Administrative Areas, Mainte-**
**nance Areas and Stores Depots. The sizes**
of these facilities are to a large extent determined
by the amount of infrastructure needed to perform
these functions.
f. **Ammunition Depots. Ammunition depots are**
used to store large quantities of defence ammunition. Variables that have an influence on the size
of these depots include the types of munitions to
be stored and the prescribed safety margins. Different types of munitions, for instance pyrotechnics
and projectiles, are stored in separate bunkers for
safety reasons. Clearly defined safety distances are
maintained between bunkers, as well as on the
perimeter.
g. **Weapon Ranges. The size of weapon ranges is**
determined by the maximum application distance
and safety arcs of weapons to be employed.
h. **Naval Bases. The size of these facilities is to a**


large extent determined by the amount of infrastructure needed to perform their function and to
allow for the training of personnel.
i. **Air Force Bases. Apart from runways and in-**
frastructure provision, a large number of variables,
such as restricted air space, aerial approach zones,
safety areas on the perimeter and radio frequency
requirements, are taken into account in determining
the size of an air force base.
j. **Telecommunication Installations. A major**
consideration in determining the size of telecommunication installations is the required presence of
a magnetically clear spectrum around the facilities.
k. **Rifle Ranges. Rifle ranges are designed and es-**
tablished according to a set of clearly defined guidelines. Variables which might come into play include
land use activities on adjacent properties and the
distance from residential infrastructure.

167.  The migration towards the Defence Blueprint Force Design means that the defence infrastructure footprint will have to
be realigned according to South Africa’s defence needs. The
Force Design will serve as the basis for determining defence facilities and environmental support requirements. The spatial dispersion of defence land and facilities will further be influenced by
the pursuit of both a landward and a maritime defence strategy.
a. The establishment of new defence operational
facilities must be pursued after a thorough assessment of both the geographical location and the security requirements of South Africa’s dispersed vital
infrastructure.
b. Any expansion or reduction in the defence footprint would have to be executed in a responsible
and strategic manner so as not to impact on defence
capabilities and the operational readiness of the Defence Force. Surplus and redundant facilities will be
surrendered to the Department of Public Works for
alternative utilisation or disposal.
c. The number of leased defence properties must be
reduced by translating the portfolio of leased properties to that of ownership of defence properties.
This may, where possible, be pursued through alternate funding models, such as cooperation with
the Public Investment Corporation (PIC) or Public
Private Partnerships (PPPs) where possible within
the relevant framework established by National
Treasury.

168. The Chief of the Defence Force’s logistic staff will establish
a comprehensive Defence Facility Strategy that will address the
defence footprint requirement. In so doing new ways may be
explored to manage defence facilities in a consolidated and proactive manner, including co-use and cooperation agreements.


-----

169. Defence strives to achieve efficiency and effectiveness in
the use of facilities and has achieved a considerable reduction in
its footprint by surrendering unused land to the Department of
Public Works. The Government Immovable Asset Management
Act (Act No 19 of 2007) has emphasised this matter and defence
strives to comply therewith. Since 1986, defence has consequently returned approximately 311 000 hectares of land to the
Department of Public Works, largely as a result of a reduced
defence posture, internal rationalisation, restitution claims and
urban and agricultural pressures.

###### REPAIR AND MAINTENANCE OF      DEFENCE FACILITIES

170. The matter of the repair and maintenance of defence facilities has gained considerable prominence in recent years. Repair
and maintenance is the responsibility of the Department of Public Works. However, funding constraints have severely hindered
the maintenance of essential defence infrastructure, giving rise
to a significant maintenance backlog which impacts directly on
the operational readiness of the Defence Force and its ability to
prepare and employ forces.

171. Defence has consequently engaged in a significant repair
and maintenance programme (RAMP) in collaboration with the
Department of Public Works. To a large extent this has been supported through the provision of additional funding through the
annual MTEF Policy Options. These consolidated interventions
will contribute to the reduction of the backlog.

172. The Defence Works Formation is to take over the full responsibility of the Department of Public Works and manage the
renewal of defence assets. The Defence Works Formation, as
well as SA Army Field Engineer Regiments in each province, will
focus on the reduction of the repair and maintenance backlog of
defence infrastructure, as well as arresting the further deterioration of defence facilities.

###### CO-USE OF DEFENCE FACILITIES

173. There is great pressure to become more cost-effective in
defence facility management, while at the same time ensuring
that the Defence Force retains its proficiency. This necessitates
the exploration of alternative ways to finance and maintain defence facilities.

174. The private sector has lodged many requests for the couse of defence facilities in recent years. Under-developed land
and under-utilised facilities can be made available for additional


uses, providing there is coherence with existing defence facilities
and that core military activities are not compromised. The principal restricting factor in this regard is security and safety. In many
cases, alternative use will require a portion of land or facilities
to be isolated from the main defence activities. Defence may
further give consideration to entering into joint ventures with developers and conservation organisations to minimise the cost of
managing defence facilities and to improve defence infrastructure
without drawing on additional state funds.


_“I submit that it may be useful to open bases for private_
_activities, in order to share costs, and to create a basis for_
_training and experience of essential manpower. This could_
_be done by allowing private activities on selected military_
_airfields and harbours, with due consideration for security_
_and control.”_

**Mr Coen van Wyk – Private Submission**


###### LAND RESTITUTION

175. Defence is committed to the equitable resolution of land
restitution claims in the spirit of enhancing social justice. The
Restitution of Land Rights Act was approved by Parliament in
1994 and the Commission on Restitution of Land Rights was
established in 1995. Defence is affected by restitution claims
against certain defence land. The restitution process provides a
framework and various options to arrive at an appropriate solution through negotiation by the parties or adjudication by the
Land Claims Court. Restitution can take the following forms:
restoration of the land from which claimants were dispossessed;
provision of alternative land; payment of compensation; alternative relief including a package containing a combination of the
above, sharing of the land, or special budgetary assistance such
as services and infrastructure development where claimants
presently live; or priority access to state resources in the allocation and development of housing and land in the appropriate
development programme.

176. Although defence has prioritised the restoration of the land
concerned, rather than other forms of restitution, this has not
always been possible. In some cases the land has been retained
and compensation has been made, or alternative land provided.
Certain land claims remain in the restitution process and will be
finalised in collaboration with the Land Claims Commissioner or
in the courts. In all instances, defence remains committed to the
principle of equitable restitution.


-----

177. **Principles. Defence will apply the following principles in**
relation to land restitution:
a. Commitment to the Constitution and the affirmation of the land reform programme.
b. A proactive approach towards restitution is adopted.
c. Preference will be given to the restoration of land
rather than other forms of restoration.
d. Commitment to the speedy resolution of restitution
cases.
e. Creative alternatives explored in cases where land
cannot be restored.
f. Where defence land is handed back to claimants,
the acquisition of alternate land will be assessed in
terms of core defence functions and activities.
g. The acquisition of alternative land arising from settlement transfers will be determined consensually
amongst all relevant government departments and
ministries.
h. Commitment to transparency in the restitution
process.
i. Commitment to the resolution of land claims
through negotiations and the remedy of the Land
Claims Court as a last resort.
j. Land under claim will be made available for restitution unless the Department of Defence deems it not
feasible. Non-feasibility could be due to:
i. Financial cost.
ii. Unique location of the facility.
iii. Unique military requirements.
iv. Strategic value of the facility.

###### DISPOSAL OF DEFENCE FACILITIES

178. Base closure is a complex issue requiring careful consideration of processes, role players and timeframes. The closure
of defence properties presents both opportunities and serious
challenges. Some of the major problems associated with defence base closure are the following:
a. The loss of employment opportunities in defence
and associated industries as well as within local supporting economies.
b. Some defence properties are environmentally contaminated and often require very costly clean-up
operations.
c. Maintenance and protection of the bases before reuse or ultimate disposal can be costly.
d. The development opportunities arising from the
reuse of bases can be plentiful depending on the


###### ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT APPROACH

180. The increased emphasis on the sustainable use of natural
resources requires a complete review of the impact of military
activities on the natural and built environments. Urban sprawl
causes defence installations and facilities to compete with other
local activities. Public complaints over dust and noise, demands
for urban development of “prime” real estate, and increasing requirements for minerals, grazing land and water are all external
forces that compete with the use of land by the military.

181. By effectively integrating environmental considerations
into the planning and execution of all military activities, defence
can minimise the adverse effects of its activities as well as make a
substantial social contribution towards the conservation and sustainable utilisation of environmental resources in South Africa.

182. Defence is committed to the responsible use and management of land and facilities used for the execution of its core
functions and will thus minimise and manage the impact on the
environment. Defence environmental management remains
complex and forms an integral part of the broader defence management system.

183. Sustainable environmental management of defence training areas will ensure that the quality of the defence land resources is maintained for realistic training in future. Incorporating environmental practices into military procedures and operations
will have financial benefits such as reducing energy costs and
clean-up, disposal or litigation costs.

184. Defence remains committed to the principles of military
integrated environmental management through a corporate


geographic location and infrastructure of the base
concerned. Developmental factors will be a major
consideration taken into account when evaluating
the various land use and conversion options for obsolete bases.

179. State land surplus to requirements is usually handed back
to the Department of Public Works. The remediation, cleanup, closure, handing over and subsequent disposal of redundant
state land must take place in a coordinated manner.


##### DEFENCE ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT


-----

environmental management plan and specific operational environmental implementation plans. Accordingly, defence land and
facilities will be managed sustainably in accordance with the relevant legislation, policies, norms and standards aimed at minimising the negative effects of military activities.

185. Military Integrated Environmental Management will be
dealt with as a recognised and dedicated defence support function through funded corporate programmes. Military activities
will be fulfilled in accordance with environmentally sustainable
best practices. This commitment applies across the scope of
military activities.

###### GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE

186. Human security is promoted and threatened by a variety
of economic, cultural, political and environmental factors. Global
environmental change and human security refer to efforts to link
security to environmental change and therefore large-scale hazards to human security posed by global environmental change
include climate change, stratospheric ozone depletion, loss of
biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, changes in hydrological
systems and supplies of fresh water, desertification and land degradation and the depletion of non-renewable energy resources.

###### ENVIRONMENTAL CONTINGENT LIABILITY

187. The obligation to clean up unexploded ordnance (UXO)
and spillages on defence training areas constitutes an environmental contingent liability that must be disclosed in the annual
defence financial statements. Although defence training areas are
swept for blinds and misfires after training exercises, they are
not entirely cleared, and UXO as well as contamination from
explosive debris is left behind, which poses a threat to human life
and the environment, either for new inhabitants of the area or
for participants in the following training exercise. Procedures and
models must be developed to identify, determine and disclose
such contingent environmental liabilities.

###### ENVIRONMENTAL COOPERATIVE GOVERNANCE

188. Defence environmental policy and activities must be consistent with national environmental policy, and promote cooperation with environmental bodies. Defence regional envi

ronmental advisory forums will be used to enlist the support of
external experts in the management of military properties.

###### GRAVES AND BURIAL SITES

189. Some defence areas contain burial sites. Relatives and descendants are allowed to visit these graves when training activities
permit and with due regard to their safety. Defence will remain
sensitive to this issue and this practice will continue. This will be
properly regulated in regulations to standardise procedures and
set public liability regarding access to such burial sites on military
properties. An inventory of all graves on defence-controlled areas will be established.

###### CLEAN-UP AND REMEDIATION OF DEFENCE TRAINING AREAS

190. Defence training activities have a variety of environmental
impacts. Environmentally destructive effects and by-products of
military operations, such as UXO, shrapnel, targets and debris
which leach explosives and heavy metals into groundwater, all
forms of waste, pollution, fuel spills and other chemicals released
as a result of military action, and the destruction of vegetation by
military vehicles or explosives, threaten the integrity of the physical environment and natural resources. These have become
central drivers for cleanup and remediation due to the inherent
risk to personnel, the public and the environment.

191. Informed by safety considerations, training areas will be
regularly cleared. This entails the clearing of all UXO and other
visually detected debris. To this end, an inherent military range
clearance (MRC) capability will be established. This process will
use an integrated seven-step process to include environmentally-friendly detection of UXO and subsurface clearance technologies, as well as models and tools for determining the costing,
prioritisation and Geographic Information System (GIS) decision
support for the clean-up and remediation of all live-fire military
training areas.

###### ENVIRONMENT FOR MILITARY OPERATIONS

192. Environmental considerations will be incorporated in the
planning and execution of joint, combined and multinational exercises and force employment processes. Environmental management personnel will be deployed to advise and assist on en

-----

vironmental best practice and ensure
the implementation of the necessary
remediation measures following the
demobilisation of forces.

193. The relationship between human security, global environmental
change and military integrated environmental management is indicated
in Figure 14-5.

###### ENVIRONMENTAL SECURITY

194. Environmental scarcity is determined by environmental change,
population size and growth, and unequal distribution (or access to) resources. Of these factors, unequal
access to resources is not bound
by physical limits alone. Leading examples of emerging environmental
change are: depletion and pollution
of fresh water supplies, depletion of
fisheries, degradation and disappearance of biodiversity, degradation and
loss of agriculture lands, food and
health safety, stratospheric ozone
depletion, and global warming.
These challenges will likely be growing threats to environmental security
and ultimately affect human security
in future. _Figure 14-5: Military Environmental Management Model_

## DEFENCE INDUSTRY POLICY AND STRATEGY


##### INTRODUCTION


##### NATIONAL DEFENCE INDUSTRY COUNCIL


1. The **purpose of this chapter is to** **provide strategic**
**guidance to the development of policies and strategies**
concerning the South African defence industry, with **specific**
**emphasis on the attainment of the Defence Review and**
the pursuit of the Defence Strategic Trajectory. The National Defence Industry Council, as discussed hereunder, will
have the responsibility to further develop these strategic guidelines into specific policies and strategies.

2. The term **defence industry in this chapter refers to**
companies (both public and private) that are **primarily con-**
**cerned with the design, development, manufacture, produc-**
tion or support of weapons, munitions, pyrotechnics, equipment systems and other matériel for the Defence Force or for
export; divisions of companies in other sectors that are so engaged; and companies that are major sub-contractors or component suppliers to such activities.


3. Given the strategic relevance of this industry sector to
South Africa’s defence and security, its indirect but considerable importance to economic and industrial development, and
further its potential as a tool of foreign policy, a National De**fence Industry Council will be established as a signifi-**
**cant policy making and coordination tool for the de-**
**fence industry. The National Defence Industry Council will**
be charged with the tasks of:
a. Establishing and maintaining the focus of a nation**al vision in respect of the defence industry.**
b. **Coordinating approaches between the De-**
fence Force and the defence industry in pursuit of
**the Defence Strategic Trajectory.**
c. Overseeing the **development and** **implemen-**
**tation of** **policies and strategies appropriate**
to the defence industry, and, in particular, the Na**tional Defence Industrial Strategy.**
d. Ensuring the optimal integration of the defence
industry within the National Development Plan, industrial and trade policy and South Africa’s regional
and wider foreign policy and strategy.


-----

e. Identifying and furthering the **optimal develop-**
**ment of the defence industry.**
f. Providing the **coordination of** **government’s**
**marketing support to the defence industry.**

4. This National Defence Industry Council should be chaired
**by the Minister of Defence or, in the unavoidable absence**
of the Minister, by the Deputy Minister of Defence, and should
have a small permanent secretariat located within the Ministry. Its members should include:
a. The Secretary for Defence.
b. The Chief of the Defence Force.
c. The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Armscor, as
the defence acquisition agent.
d. A senior representative from each of the following
potential clients of the industry:
i. The South African Police Service.
ii. The Intelligence Services.
e. A senior official from each of the Departments of:
i. International Relations and Cooperation.
ii. Public Enterprises.
iii. Trade and Industry; and
iv. Science and Technology.
f. The Group CEO of Denel.
g. The Chairperson of the AMD Board and senior industry executives representing the public and private
sectors and the various competency areas of this
industry.
h. Selected scientists and academics from the CSIR
(DPSS) and those universities active in defence-related research or researching other fields of relevance
to the Defence Force.

5. In order to be effective in steering and supporting the
South African defence industry, the Council will meet at least
**quarterly to consider the state of the South African defence**
industry, the challenges it faces and international developments,
and to make any necessary determinations and recommendations on that basis.

6. The National Defence Industry Council may further
develop **legislation and consequent** **regulations as may be**
necessarily for the implementation of the policy frameworks
that are developed. A possible example hereof may include the
promulgation, through Parliament, of enabling legislation and
regulations so as to ensure government control over identified
**vital technologies and wider strategic independence,**
and the extent of foreign ownership of South African defence industry companies.


###### BACKGROUND

7. **South Africa is one of the top thirty economic actors in**
the world and is **not aligned to any major power. South**
Africa is classified as a middle-income, emerging economy,
**affluent in natural resources with well-developed legal,**
communications, financial, energy and transport sectors. Agriculture contributes 9% to the gross domestic product, with
**industry and services contributing 26% and 65% respectively.**
South Africa has by far the largest and most sophisticated economy on the African continent. South Africa has the 25[th] largest gross domestic product in the world accounting for 25% of
Africa’s GDP and 33% of the sub-Saharan GDP, and has been
ranked as the 32[nd] largest importer and 37[th] largest exporter.
**More than 50% of the economy is trade-related, with**
mining, manufacturing, services and to a lesser degree agriculture as the mainstays of the economy. The **bulk of exports**
**and imports is transported via sea lines of communica-**
**tion, with the Port of Durban being one of the busiest in the**
Southern Hemisphere.

###### REQUIREMENT FOR A DEFENCE INDUSTRY

8. South Africa requires an effective defence capability, which
includes, as an integral element, a defence industry to sup**port sovereign capabilities and** **maintain an essential**
**level of strategic independence. A** **vibrant, focused**
**defence industry is thus a major asset to South Africa,**
strengthens its defence and security capabilities; supports its
foreign policy initiatives – particularly within the region and on
the continent – and is supportive to the national develop**ment agenda.**

9. A vibrant defence industry remains a critical component
of an effective South African defence capability, providing South
Africa with a defence and security industrial base that must
be positioned to ensure the attainment of the Defence Re**view** and the **pursuit of the Defence Strategic Trajec-**
**tory. This will in the main include, were appropriate, support**
in pursuit of:
a. **Strategic independence.**
b. **Sovereign capability in selected areas.**
c. **Optimised equipment and systems.**
d. **Cost-effective equipment, systems and services to**
the Defence Force and other Security Services.
**Economic benefit derived from necessary de-**
fence expenditure.
f. **Collateral benefit ensuing from the endeavours**
of the defence industry.


##### POLICY INTENT


-----

10. The intention of government is to not only maintain,
**but also further develop South Africa’s defence indus-**
**try as a key national asset and as a** **key partner in the**
**pursuit of the Defence Strategic Trajectory.**

11. As such this industry should be identified, recognised, supported and prioritised as a strategic manufacturing sector
by the Department of Trade and Industry. It is, further, the intention of government to work closely with the public and
**private sectors to achieve this goal and to do so cost-effec-**
tively. This will give South Africa a defence and security industrial
base that will, in addition to the characteristics described above,
provide increased access for Black businesses and military veterans to a sustainable technology-intensive and competitive industry sector.

12. The development of South Africa’s defence industry must,
however, occur within the context of the wider international
defence industry, taking account of general developments in that
industry, as well as the evolving nature of armed conflict and the
requirements that arise from it, and developments in technology. Further, while that defence industry will depend heavily on
government orders, it will also:
a. Bring **valuable technological spin-offs for the**
wider economy and industry, chiefly in the form of
technologies new to South Africa and localised in
the course of designing, developing, manufacturing
or supporting defence equipment.
b. Play a crucial role in developing the country’s in**tellectual and skills capital, by virtue of its need**
for scientists, researchers, engineers and technicians
and the effect of defence projects in attracting the
right calibre of people into the relevant professions.
c. Make a major contribution to the GDP growth.
d. Generate **foreign currency earnings from ex-**
port sales and the support of exported equipment
and systems.

13. The establishment, development and retention of certain
defence industrial capabilities **will not be solely governed**
**by market forces, due regard being had for strategic**
**necessity and also for strategic advantage, and particularly in**
respect of defence matériel over which sovereign control is
required. Government may, therefore, **retain or establish**
**state-owned enterprises in technology domains that**
**are necessary to the attainment of the Defence Re-**
**view and the** **pursuit of the Defence Strategic Trajec-**
**tory, as developed from national security and defence policy**
objectives, but that are not commercially viable in South
Africa.


###### Strategic Independence

14. **Strategic independence here means the ability of the**
Defence Force to perform its **key functions for** **extended**
**periods without reliance on direct foreign support in re-**
spect of critical capabilities. This will chiefly require South Africa
to retain the capability to:
a. **Support, maintain and repair critical equip-**
ment and systems.
b. **Manufacture critical munitions, batteries, com-**
ponents and sub-assemblies (amongst others).
c. Manufacture such **high-rate-of-use spares and**
other items as cannot be either:
i. Stockpiled in sufficient quantity;
ii. brought into production at short notice without direct foreign assistance; or
iii. acquired from multiple foreign sources via
multiple channels, to negate an embargo by
one or more governments.

15. Strategic independence further means the ability to:
a. Conduct operational research across the spectrum of Defence Force responsibilities.
b. Comprehensively and thoroughly test and evalu**ate** equipment, munitions, systems and other defence matériel to a standard that ensures that items
acquired by the Defence Force fully comply with the
requirement and the related specifications, including
aspects such as reliability, availability, maintainability
and durability (RAM-D).
c. Ensure effective **in-service testing and evalu-**
**ation of** **combat readiness and** **system**
**efficiency.**
d. Conduct or manage directed, focused research
**and development in connection with the devel-**
opment of Defence Force requirements and the
related specifications.

16. Such capabilities are at present managed by:
a. Armscor Defence Institutes: Alkantpan, Armour
Development, Defence Decision Support Institute,
Eclipse, Ergotech, Flamengro, Gerotek, Hazmat, Institute for Maritime Technology (IMT), Protechnik.
b. CSIR Defence, Peace, Safety and Security (DPSS):
Electronics Defence Evaluation and Research Institute (DERI), Aeronautics DERI, Landwards DERI,
Special Operations DERI, Paardefontein Antenna
Test Range, Paardefontein Blast Range.
c. Denel: Overberg Test Range (air-, ground-, and
ship-launched weapons, evaluation of weapons/
combat systems, flight test support and limited satellite support).


-----

###### Sovereign Capability

17. **Sovereign capability here means the ability to ensure,**
**under full national control and without reliance on any**
direct foreign assistance, certain capabilities identified as vi**tal to national security, including, but not limited to, com-**
mand and control, secure communications, aspects of precision-guided munitions, elements of electronic warfare, relevant
algorithms and relevant software. This will require, as far as is
**practicable:**
a. The capability to integrate and support such systems and equipment.
b. The capability to **design, develop and support**
relevant algorithms and software.
c. The capability to design, develop and manufac**ture certain equipment locally, which does not ex-**
clude the use of imported components.
d. The control of those capabilities under custodian**ship by either a** **public or private South Afri-**
**can-owned company.**

###### Optimised Equipment and Systems

18. **Optimised here refers to equipment and systems spe-**
**cifically developed or adapted to meet the demands set by:**
a. A harsh and unforgiving operating environment:
heat, dust, torrential rain, little infrastructure and few
and poor roads.
b. A demanding **operational environment: low-**
force densities that require dispersed operations, no
clearly defined front line or even area of operations,
and insecure lines of supply.
c. The operational style developed by the Defence
Force to meet those challenges: high-mobility/hightempo, dispersed, joint operations
d. The need to be interoperable with selected legacy
equipment and systems, including some equipment
and systems used by the Police and other agencies
and departments of government
e. The desire to achieve increased interoperability
with regional partners.
f. The need to eEnsuring the **supportability of**
equipment and systems.

19. Examples of such optimised equipment include wheeled
combat vehicles (good operational mobility), long-range artillery (support of dispersed force elements) and rugged logistic
vehicles, as well as communications equipment suited to those
operational, geographic and climatic conditions.


###### Economic Benefit

20. The potential to leverage wider economic and indus**trial opportunity on the basis of necessary expenditure**
**on defence and security equipment and systems has**
been demonstrated in several developing countries:
a. Manufacturing and supporting defence matériel cre**ates skilled and semi-skilled jobs and develops**
the experience and skills of the people involved,
both within the defence industry itself and in the general industry companies that form part of the defence
and security supply chain, executing sub-contracts or
supplying some related equipment or components.
b. Development of defence equipment establishes, and
can sometimes develop, new technologies, tech**niques and processes that ‘spin off’ to other**
**sectors of industry to the benefit of the national**
economy, enhancing international competitiveness
and supporting the national development agenda.
c. Defence research and development develops new
technologies that also spin off to other sectors, sup**porting the National System of Innovation**
and also further **reinforcing the development**
**agenda.**
d. People with skills and experience gained in the defence industry also spin off to other sectors, **ex-**
**panding the national skills and experience**
**base.**

21. There is also the potential to align the defence acquisi**tion strategy with the industrial development strategy**
of the Department of Trade and Industry, for instance by designating certain sectors for localisation where there are common
technologies for military and civilian products. One possible example might be found in heavy vehicles, which could also have
some export potential.

###### Collateral Benefit

22. The defence sector has the demonstrated potential to
**create indigenous technologies and bring foreign tech-**
**nologies into the country and establish them, from which**
base they and the related skills can migrate to other sectors
**of the economy. Internationally, much existing technology has**
been a result of spin-off from developments in the defence industry. The trend today is for spin-on from commercial developments into the defence field. Much of the underlying technology
is, in fact, still a result of past defence research, and much fundamental and applied research around the world is still being driven
by the work undertaken in the defence field.


-----

23. The defence industry’s range of products and services
will contribute to the technology and knowledge base
**of the country. It will further publically pronounce on a**
**strategy that sets out its contribution toward addressing na-**
**tional strategic concerns, especially developmental driv-**
**ers such as education, health and economic development.**

###### LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIPS

24. The definition of what is critical, where sovereign control is required, and where the benefits of optimisation justify
the investment and cost, will be developed and set out in
**the Defence Industry Strategy, and amended from time to**
time as the strategic situation may require.

25. Achieving and maintaining the desired level of strategic independence, the desired sovereign capabilities, and the ability
to develop optimised equipment and systems will require suf**ficient, ongoing, long-term investment by government in:**
a. Relevant education, training and skills retention
programmes.
b. A defence science, engineering and technology
support capability and funding of both general and
specific research and development projects and
programmes.
c. Maintaining and modernising or upgrading facilities.
d. Export support to facilitate future research and
development.

26. The **responsibility lies with the Defence Force**
to ensure that sufficient (and sufficiently regular) funding is directed to maintaining defence industrial capabilities or
**technologies that are identified as having vital impor-**
**tance, especially in respect of the underlying technologies, the**
required skills, and the required research, design, development,
manufacturing and support facilities.


##### DEFENCE FORCE/DEFENCE INDUSTRY RELATIONSHIP


27. The **defence engagement of the defence industry is**
**premised primarily on the Defence Review, and on the**
**attainment of the Defence Strategic Trajectory.**

28. The focus of the defence/industry relationship is thus (in
the main) in the pursuit of: firstly, the development of strategic
technologies and capabilities; **secondly, the ongoing matériel**
and services needs of the Defence Force; thirdly, the in-service support of defence systems and prime mission equipment;
and fourthly, upgrades and modernisation, where appropriate.


29. **Defence matériel programmes will be specifically**
**guided by the** **Military Strategy, an** **optimised and in-**
**tegrated Defence Capability Strategy and a** **conse-**
**quent Defence Long-Term Capital Plan, which must be**
determined by the **Chief of the Defence Force. The de-**
fence matériel requirement will be ameliorated with avail**able resources, in order to establish long term plans and**
programmes. Defence matériel programmes will be executed
within the frameworks established for this purpose.

30. The objective is to develop a healthy partnership between the **Defence Force and its supporting industry,**
with local industry in principle enjoying preference, where it can
practicably and cost-effectively meet requirements. This will be
a policy principle in the new acquisition policy.

31. The strategic orientation of the defence industry will
be primarily informed by South Africa’s defence and security
**sector priorities. Local sourcing will be primarily pur-**
**sued, where possible, in the following areas:**
a. Manufacture of missiles and wider guided munitions
technology, products and systems.
b. Manufacture of critical munitions and ordnance.
c. Manufacture of critical and alternate energy and
propulsion sources.
d. Manufacture of critical and high-rate-of-use spares
and other stores.
e. Support of equipment, systems and weapons, and
the related training systems and facilities.
f. System integration to allow optimisation of equipment, weapons and systems for specific defence
requirements, and to minimise strategic risk.

32. This will be accompanied by an additional orientation
on ensuring:
a. The **commercial viability of South African de-**
fence products, particularly those that may be required by other regional and continental armed
forces.
b. **Harmonising, where feasible, military-off-the-shelf**
(MOTS) and commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS)
**requirements, or aligning defence orders with**
export orders, with the aim of achieving larger production orders to result in longer production runs
and the accompanying economies of scale.
c. **Mutual spin-on and spin-off of civilian and mili-**
tary capabilities.

33. An **integrated government focus, informed by the**
defence interest and so championed by defence, will be pursued, inter alia, in the following domains where viable prod

-----

**ucts, capabilities or particular niche areas exist:**
a. The aerospace sector.
b. The maritime sector.
c. The landward sector.
d. The command and control and Information Warfare
sector.
e. National Defence Industry Council specified South
African defence and security niche or competitive
edge capabilities.
f. Centres of excellence enhancing or contributing to
the National System of Innovation.
g. Potential new business in cooperation with other
nations, and particularly in cooperation with South
Africa’s strategic partners.

34. The support of equipment, systems and weapons, and related training systems and facilities, may (where it is practicable
and it holds no disadvantage in respect of operational readiness,
the ability to deploy forces, sustainability and resilience) be considered for out-sourcing.


##### INDUSTRY FOCUS AREAS


35. It is not the intention to recreate the exceptional breadth
and depth of capabilities that was a feature of the defence industry during the period of the arms embargo, as that:
a. Is not essential to South Africa’s national security;
b. Would be neither cost-effective nor practicable at a
time when defence companies worldwide are having to globalise to survive; and
c. Would tend to remove the industry from relevant
global supply chains, making it increasingly difficult to
win substantial export orders.

36. The intention is rather to focus on those areas and sectors
of defence technology and manufacturing that offer real potential
to meet the policy intent set out above.

37. It is important to ensure that the flow of national con**tracts for defence and security research, development, manu-**
facturing and support is structured and phased such that:
a. The Defence Force brings equipment and systems
**into service at a steady rate to ensure an** **ef-**
**ficient commissioning process** and to **avoid**
**block obsolescence.**
b. The **domestic defence and security industry**
has a viable base load of work to:
i. Sustain research, design, development, industrialisation and manufacturing capabilities and
capacities;
ii. enable it to continuously renew itself in terms


of human capital and capital equipment; and
iii. serve as a base for export ventures.

38. It is, further, the intention that the Defence Force, like all
other government entities, will contribute toward addressing
**national strategic concerns, especially** **developmental**
**drivers such as education, health and economic development.**
The defence industry’s range of products and services will also
**contribute to the technology base of the country.**

###### AREAS OF COMPETENCE

39. The focus of national support for the defence industry,
based on military priorities, will, therefore, be on primarily
**local sourcing, insofar as is practicable, in the following**
areas:
a. Support of equipment, systems and weapons and
the related training systems and facilities.
b. Manufacture of critical munitions.
c. Manufacture of critical, specialised batteries and other energy sources.
d. Manufacture of critical and high-rate-of-use spares
and other stores.
e. System integration, to:
i. Allow optimisation of equipment, weapons and systems for specific Defence Force
requirements.
ii. Minimise political/strategic risk.
f. Modernisation and upgrading of equipment, platforms and systems to optimise them for their roles
as conditions or requirements evolve, and to extend
their service lives.
g. Development of specific critical equipment and
systems.
h. Development of specific optimised equipment and
systems.
i. Sustained manufacture of equipment required in
large numbers or amounts.

###### KEY TECHNOLOGY DOMAINS

40. Further to the pursuit of the Defence Strategic Tra**jectory, the** **initial focus of the support for those capability**
areas will be on the following technology domains:
a. Command and control.
b. Information warfare, at all levels of war.
c. Secure communications.
d. Information technology, including data fusion
technology.
e. Intelligence-gathering sensor, analysis and evaluation
technology.


-----

f. Target acquisition and identification technology.
g. Unmanned systems (aerial, ground, surface and
under-water).
h. Missile and wider guided munitions technology.
i. Night and poor visibility observation and engagement technology.
j. Electronic warfare technology.
k. Rugged tactical vehicles optimised for operations in
the African theatre.
l. Mine and IED detection and protection technology.
m. Long-range artillery, precision bombardment and
point target engagement systems.
n. Chemical, biological and radiological defence, including the manufacture of military carbons and
canisters.
o. Battlefield medical care optimised for the African
theatre of operations.
p. Modelling and simulation.

41. The aerospace sector should be considered for inclusion in this group of key defence industry sectors if it is believed
that there is real potential to develop a viable product or viable
capabilities in particular niche areas. It may, for instance, be possible to:
a. Expand South Africa’s capabilities in the field of un**manned aerial systems on the basis of existing**
capabilities in that field and in related fields, and on
the basis of the airframe development capability resulting from UAV projects and the light multi-role
aircraft currently in development;
b. develop one or both of those concept aircraft into a
viable operational system with real export potential;
or
c. duild on the Air Force’s medium- to long-term requirements for **combat support and medium**
**transport helicopters to develop a local manu-**
facturing capability and linked maintenance, repair
and overhaul capability to support other helicopters
in the wider region.

42. In addition, government will support **niche capability**
**areas** in which the South African defence and security industry has a demonstrable edge or potential to gain such
**edge. Among them are:**
a. Precision-guided weapons and precision engagement systems.
b. Fire direction systems.
c. Products or technologies in any field in which an
edge can be established.

43. Government will further support the establishment of
**centres of excellence for each of the key domains and areas**


###### WORLD-CLASS ACQUISITION POLICY

44. Defence will retain a robust, world-class acquisition
**policy that is focused on: firstly, executing the defence capital**
plan; secondly, maintaining key defence technologies and capabilities through specific measures, conditions and provisions,
including the vesting of such in identified industry partners;
**thirdly, timely, efficient and cost-effective equipment acquisi-**
tion; fourthly, sustaining and further developing the South African defence industry; and fifthly, setting the parameters within
which Armscor (as the defence acquisition agent) will support
the defence acquisition process.

45. The entire acquisition effort will be informed and regulated through a single defence acquisition policy, binding on
both defence and Armscor, and such policy being firmly focused
on supporting the attainment of the Defence Capability Strategy
and consequent Capital Plan. A high premium will be placed
on both risk reduction and efficiency.

46. The entire acquisition process is required to pur**sue, to the fullest extent, the Defence Capability Strategy and its**
consequent Long-Term Capital Plan. The strategies, policies
**and procedures of both defence and Armscor will thus be ful-**
ly aligned and pursue a continuum of defence acquisition.

47. Predicated on the desire to achieve heightened levels of
efficiency, effectiveness and economy with commensurately reduced bureaucracy and shorter delivery timeframes, Armscor
will provide strategic assistance in the acquisition of de**fence systems, defence research and development and**
the through-life-support of defence systems. It will be the
**contracting and quality assurance authority for defence**
acquisitions.

48. To this end, the Defence Force is to develop a long-term,
securely funded, multi-year **Defence Capability Strategy**
**and consequent Capital Plan, enabling:**
a. The Defence Force to develop integrated acqui**sition approaches that will:**


of competence. This support will be part of the national drive
to enhance the National System of Innovation, thereby
creating imperatives for other national research bodies, such as
the Department of Science and Technology, to invest in these
sectors and areas of competence. Government will also seriously consider support for entry into other domains where
there is real potential for success, perhaps in **cooperation**
**with other nations.**


##### DEFENCE ACQUISITION AND PROCUREMENT POLICIES


-----

i. **Synchronise joint capability planning to**
enhance interoperability.
ii. Address **prime mission equipment as a**
**complete system, by means of synchro-**
nised projects.
iii. Allow long-term, coherent and **integrated**
**modernisation and upgrade plans to be**
developed and implemented.
b. The Defence Force to develop coherent **long-**
**term acquisition plans, to:**
i. Largely avoid block obsolescence.
ii. **Retain project management skills within**
Services, corps and branches.
iii. **Achieve long production runs and ac-**
companying **economies of scale, where**
applicable.
iv. Make possible **properly planned lifecycle**
**management of equipment, which may**
include using availability- or performancebased contracts placed with the industry to
complement or supplement internal capacities
and capabilities.
c. **Defence industry companies to plan their fu-**
**ture properly on the basis of the Defence Force’s**
long-term, integrated capability requirement planning and multi-year manufacturing, modernisation/
upgrade and support contracts, to which end defence acquisition plans will, except with respect to
particularly sensitive projects, be available in an open
form with sufficient detail of the requirements and
the allocated funding and funds flow to make such
planning practicable.
d. Coordination with domestic **industrial develop-**
**ment objectives of the Department of Trade**
**and Industry.**

49. As a **general principle, the acquisition of technology-**
sensitive equipment, weapons and systems will be dealt with in a
**phased manner to the extent possible, as to avoid the chal-**
**lenge of block obsolescence. Nonetheless, some equip-**
ment will require immediate and expedited acquisition.

###### REVISED PROCUREMENT POLICY

50. The intent of the defence industry policy will be further
**supported by a revised procurement policy that is focused**
on three primary tenets:
a. The seamless integration of procurement and
**acquisition policies in support of the Defence**
**Strategic Trajectory.**
b. **Responsive and reliable support to defence**
systems and prime mission equipment.


c. The **geographically decentralised procure-**
**ment of general stores and services.**

51. The purpose of the decentralised procurement of
**general stores** **and services is:**
a. To enable units to procure commodities and services
promptly as and when they are needed.
b. To **disperse Defence Force** **procurement ex-**
**penditure across a wider spectrum of the econ-**
omy and, particularly, among **small and micro**
**businesses.**
c. To embed units in their local economy, thereby further strengthening the linkage between elements of the Defence Force and the communities
within which they reside, **providing stimulus to**
**local economies and contributing to the develop-**
**mental agenda of government.**

###### DEFENCE INDUSTRIAL PARTICIPATION

52. The **Defence Industrial Participation (DIP) re-**
**quirements attached to the acquisition of equipment or sys-**
tems from abroad, will, in future, be focussed primarily on:
a. A balanced and aligned consideration between
**DIP and national industrial participation**
**(NIP) obligations that may emanate jointly from**
defence acquisition programmes, especially in that
the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) is pursuing NIP as the primary mechanism to effectively
implant NIP commitments, thus requiring regu**lar and** **close collaboration between the** **DTI**
and **Armscor industrial participation** **processes**
and approval forums.
b. Ensuring the effective and efficient through-life
**support of the equipment, including its upgrad-**
ing as required during its service life.
c. Ensuring support for key sectors of the indus**try and/or the establishment of identified key**
**technologies within the industry.**
d. Facilitating efficient linkage with related govern**ment initiatives as set out in the Industrial Policy**
Action Plan (IPAP), the National Science and Technology (NST) framework, the Preferential Procurement Policy Framework Act (PPPFA) and NIP policies
and regulations.

53. Export facilitation and access to international supply chains
will be important factors, but will rank after the above in priority.

54. In any future Request for Proposal (RFP), Request for
Quotation (RFQ), or in any other solicitation document, **for-**
**eign Original Equipment Manufacturers** (OEMs) must


-----

present a viable and binding industrial participation
**plan as part of the tender submission. To ensure both the**
**transfer of knowledge and the** **cost-effective through-**
**life support of defence matériel, selected industrial par-**
ticipation activities must address any, or all, of the following key
**domains in their proposal or quotation:**
a. Human capital/technology development priorities.
b. Advanced manufacturing priorities.
c. Participation in direct or indirect manufacturing of
selected defence equipment.
d. Targeted transfer of in-service support capabilities
to local industry and/or defence facilities during the
execution of the acquisition contract.

###### EXPORT SUPPORT

55. **Government will support export sales, technology**
transfers and joint ventures by the South African defence
**industry in all areas and domains, provided that the ex-**
ports, technology transfers or joint ventures do not: compromise national security; conflict with arms export or non-proliferation legislation and policy; expose sovereign capabilities; or
hamper the future development of the South African defence
industry.

56. That support will include:
a. Ministerial and wider government support for ex**port marketing drives.**
b. A **streamlined export approval process, in-**
cluding a Cabinet-level single point of contact and
provision for accelerated approval in cases where
that is required and where that is in line with national security interests and priorities.
c. **Favoured-nation status for countries identified**
by foreign or defence policy, for instance the SADC
countries, granting automatic approval for some
classes of equipment in the absence of any specific
case against such approval.
d. Pre-approval of **long-term support contracts**
for identified countries.
e. **Defence Force support to demonstrate equip-**
ment and to assist client evaluation teams, also
forming part of wider defence diplomacy.
f. **Immediate supply from Defence Force**
**stocks where practicable and when there is no ma-**
jor implication for national security, with automatic
provision for additional defence funding to replace
those stocks.
g. **Defence Force technical and training sup-**
**port for client forces, also falling within the ambit of**
defence diplomacy.
h. Support for the acquisition of South African defence


###### TECHNOLOGY CONTEXT

57. Defence technology is complex and ever-evolving, both
in respect of technologies developed for the defence environment and in respect of technologies taken over from the civilian
environment and adapted to defence needs. The impact of defence technology on the wider economy mostly takes the form
of unexpected and unintended technology spin-offs. These often manifest in the establishment of small, medium and microenterprises, as is visible in, particularly, the science, engineering
and technology sector in South Africa.

58. **Developments in technology have a major impact**
**on defence capabilities, particularly with regard to the de-**
velopment, manufacture and support of complex systems, such
as: the weapons system of a combat helicopter; the combat
management system of a warship; a ‘system of systems’ such
as an integrated air defence system; and which require a broad
range of technical and technological skills and capabilities.

59. Defence technology research and development by its
nature is mostly focused on the advanced application of
**the physical sciences in highly specialised fields, often re-**
quires **costly and dedicated infrastructure, may involve**
hazardous materials, often **involves extended timescales**
and is uncertain in terms of the outcomes. The step from
technology development to economic exploitation of the new
technology lies in product and system development, often in
terms of optimised, perhaps even unique, military capabilities.
The return on the investment comes from the export of the
defence matériel concerned, or of matériel developed from it
for export purposes.

60. The Defence Force must remain abreast of devel**opments in defence technology and other potentially relevant**


and security equipment, by means of financing as**sistance, providing export guarantees or similar**
measures.
i. Support for the acquisition of South African defence
and security equipment, by means of offsets and
**industrial participation, particularly within the**
SADC and on the wider African continent. Such arrangements must be to the mutual benefit of both
countries.
j. Coordination with the DTI and with the Industrial
Development Corporation to **support the ex-**
**port of designated localised products and**
**services.**


##### DEFENCE SCIENCE, ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY


-----

technologies in order to be in a position to:
a. **Attain the Defence Review and** **pursue the**
**Defence Strategic Trajectory.**
b. Develop and maintain the military-technological
**insight required to understand evolving military**
**capabilities and opportunities growing out of**
new or adapted technologies.
c. Support, modernise and upgrade equipment and
systems to optimal effect.
d. **Set appropriate requirements and specifica-**
**tions for critical or optimised equipment and sys-**
tems to be developed and/or manufactured locally;
e. **Develop, manufacture and support complex**
**systems, requiring a broad range of technical and**
technological skills and capabilities.
f. Be an educated client when acquiring equip**ment or systems from other countries.**

###### TECHNOLOGY FOCUS

61. Defence technology development is generally a **long-**
**term process that only shows returns after an extended pe-**
**riod of investment. This demands a long-term approach to**
planning, funding and managing, one that **extends over the**
**expected life of the technology. This is not amenable to the**
normal open-tender contracting process, implying that the management of defence technology research and **development**
**requires a management approach that is significantly**
**different to that adopted in business-focused private bodies or**
even that adopted by academic institutes.

62. Defence will fund technology tracking and evaluation
**of new technologies by designated defence institutes and**
other research bodies and, where that may be preferable, by
industry, to ensure that it and the industry keep up with trends
and developments.

63. The management of defence technology development will
be vested in a Chief Defence Scientist, having a broad de**fence research remit, and having** **specific responsibility**
for **defining, establishing and maintaining the defence**
**research and development requirement. The Chief De-**
fence Scientist will adopt a focused approach to prevent costly duplication of capabilities, capacities and effort to ensure that
it keeps up with trends and developments. Long-term fund**ing commitments will be directed to meet strategic defence**
technology requirements at both public and private **defence**
**institutes, research bodies, academia and industry.**

64. **Preference in such research and development sup-**
**port will be given to capabilities and technologies of stra-**
**tegic or other particular importance to defence, and to**


areas where capabilities and technologies may have wider economic and developmental potential, by means of funding:
a. **In-house research and development in niche,**
**specialised or sensitive areas.**
b. Background scientific and technology research and
development by universities.
c. **Directed research and technology develop-**
**ment by the CSIR, including specialised testing and**
evaluation, modelling and simulation and a high level
of systems integration capability.
d. Focused research and product development by
**companies of the defence industry.**
e. **Specific projects proposed by** **academia and**
other companies that are of value to defence.
f. The development and production of **technology**
**demonstrators where that is relevant to de-risk-**
ing future acquisition projects or to ensuring that
the Defence Force remains an intelligent, educated
buyer in specific fields of defence matériel.

65. Subject to the determinations of the Chief Defence Scientist, the defence focus will initially rest in the following tech**nology domains:**
a. Command and control.
b. Information Warfare, at all levels of war.
c. Systems integration.
d. Secure communications.
e. Information technology, including data fusion
technology.
f. Intelligence-gathering sensor, analysis and evaluation
technology.
g. Target acquisition and identification technology.
h. Unmanned systems (aerial, ground, surface and
under-water).
i. Missile and wider guided munitions technology.
j. Night and poor visibility observation and engagement technology.
k. Electronic warfare technology.
l. Rugged tactical vehicles optimised for operations on
the African continent.
m. Mine and IED detection and protection technology.
n. Artillery, precision bombardment and point target
engagement systems.
o. Chemical, biological and radiological defence, including military carbons and canisters.
p. Battlefield medical care optimised for the African
continent.
q. Modelling and simulation.

66. Defence will also support selected **blue-sky research**
**and development that falls into either of the above categories,**
on the basis of a codified, clearly set out Defence Research


-----

**and Technology Development Strategy that is aligned**
with the national technology and innovation priorities as set out
by the Department of Science and Technology from time to
time. At least 10% of research funds will be directed to bluesky research.

###### TECHNOLOGY SUPPORT TO DEFENCE

67. **Defence operational research means the use of sci-**
entific or specialised techniques, employing mathematical methods, simulation and qualitative or logical reasoning in systematic
and general approaches to **defence problem solving and**
**decision making.**

68. Cross impacting defence science, engineering and technology support, and in particular operational research, must be
established or enhanced in the following domains to:
a. **Support strategic decision making through**
analysis, modelling and experimentation to develop:
i. Defence policies and strategies appropriate to
South Africa and its strategic environment.
ii. An understanding of the complexity of current
and future conflict, future technologies to be
found in the spectrum of conflict and trends in
the future utilisation of technology.
iii. An understanding of current and future defence conflict, and defining the concepts, capabilities and systems required to meet future
challenges.
iv. The integration, optimisation, synergising and
balance of concepts, capabilities and systems
within the context of the Defence Force
Design.
v. Defining future defence capabilities and technologies to be acquired or procured and
which are to be prioritised in the Force Design, Defence Capability Strategy, and the
Long-Term Capital Plan.
b. **Support acquisition and procurement pro-**
**grammes through:**
i. The development, establishment and maintenance of the defence technology base.
ii. Support the acquisition or procurement of interoperable equipment or technologies.
iii. Support to the upgrade of existing systems
and enhancement of their interoperability.
iv. Testing and evaluation to effectively measure
the performance of the integrated system.
c. **Support lifecycle management of defence**
**systems through:**
i. Defence systems integrity management.
ii. Responsive adaption of current defence systems to diverse operating environments.


69. With an eye to ensuring sovereign control over identified
vital technologies and wider strategic independence, the government will control the extent of foreign ownership of South
African defence industry companies. Restrictions will apply in respect of defence matériel related to capabilities that are required
to be under sovereign control or are considered essential in the
interests of strategic independence. In principle:
a. The development, manufacture and support of defence matériel over which **sovereign control is**
deemed essential will, **to the extent possible,**
be restricted to South African defence compa**nies or, when necessary, partly South African-**
**owned defence companies. To this end, it will**
be important to make proper provision for singlesource contracts.
b. The development, manufacture and support of
defence matériel related to **strategic indepen-**
**dence will, to the extent possible, be restricted**
to South African defence companies or part**ly** **South African-owned defence companies,**
but **may be contracted to South African-**
**based defence companies.**
c. Where it is necessary or preferable – for instance
for access to technologies – for such companies
to carry out such work in partnership with foreign
companies, this will be permitted, provided only
that **suitable and agreed security measures**
are implemented.

###### SOUTH AFRICAN DEFENCE COMPANY

70. A South African defence company is one that is fully con**trolled by** **South African owners, who have** **at least a**
**51%** **shareholding, those being:**
a, South African companies with no foreign shareholding exceeding 49% and fully controlled by South
African citizens; and/or


iii. Proactive and reactive logistic maintenance
and repair on in-service systems.
d. **Support system-owners and operators of in-**
**dividual weapon systems through:**
i. Integration of the weapon system with other
weapons systems into higher-order defence
capabilities.
ii. The development, maintenance and adaptation of doctrine.
iii. The development, maintenance and adaptation of tactics, techniques and procedures.
iv. Evaluating the utilisation of weapon systems to
enhance performance.


##### DEFENCE INDUSTRY OWNERSHIP


-----

b. South African citizens who do not hold any dual nationality; and
c. whose executive management comprises South African citizens who do not hold any dual nationality;
and which, further,
d. have their relevant manufacturing and, preferably,
their relevant research and development facilities in
South Africa; and
e. are fully compliant with all relevant South African legislation, except insofar as there may be a waiver or
waivers granted in consideration of strategic issues.

71. This requirement does not preclude a South African company participating in a joint venture project with a foreign company, even on a minority share basis, except in that there may be
no direct linkage to sovereign projects other than by prior agreement with the Defence Force in such cases where cooperation
with foreign companies is essential to the project, for instance in
order to acquire or develop the required technologies.

72. Where there is any significant foreign interest in a South
African defence company as defined above, **security of un-**
**interrupted supply** to the Defence Force and **security of**
**all South African intellectual property will be ensured**
by means of **appropriate government-to-government**
**agreements.**

73. **South African defence companies may** **compete**
for any and all defence contracts within their field of competence, and will enjoy preference, provided that:
a. Their products and/or services fully meet the re**quirement in all critical respects.**
b. They demonstrate the ability to support that product through its lifecycle, including such upgrades
that may be necessitated or required from time to
time.
c. No foreign product demonstrates an overwhelming
advantage over the local product.
d. Their price and long-term support price structure
are:
i. Broadly in line with other offers; or
ii. are considered acceptable given the advantages of local sourcing.

###### PARTLY SOUTH AFRICAN-OWNED DEFENCE COMPANY

74. A defence company will be considered to be **partly**
**South African-owned for the purposes of defence contract-**
ing if:
a. **At least 26% of its shares are held by South African**
citizens or by a South African company.
b. Its relevant manufacturing and/or development fa

cilities, or those relevant to any contract in question,
are located in South Africa.
c. There is security of uninterrupted supply to the
Defence Force.
d. There is an agreement with the Defence Force, if
deemed necessary accompanied by a governmentto-government agreement, covering the **security**
**of intellectual property owned by the Defence**
Force or being developed under contract from the
Defence Force, including no transfer outside South
African hands or foreign access to such intellectual
property other in terms of that agreement or a specific contract.
e. The company demonstrates a real, tangible and
**enduring commitment to:**
i. Adding economic value to South Africa.
ii. Skills development in South Africa.
f. The company is fully compliant with all relevant
South African legislation, except insofar as there may
be a waiver or waivers granted in consideration of
strategic issues.

75. **Partly South African-owned defence companies may**
**compete for any and all defence contracts within their**
fields of competence, including items over which sovereign
**control is required, given that the relevant security require-**
ments are met, and will **enjoy preference over companies**
with no or a smaller South African shareholding, provided that:
a. Their products and/or services fully meet the re**quirement in all critical respects.**
b. They demonstrate the ability to support that product through its **lifecycle, including such upgrades**
that may be necessitated or required from time to
time.
c. No foreign product demonstrates an overwhelming
advantage over the local product.
d. Their price and long-term support price structure
are:
i. Broadly in line with other offers; or
ii. are considered acceptable given the advantages of local sourcing.

###### SOUTH AFRICAN-BASED DEFENCE COMPANY

76. A defence company may be considered to be South Af**rican-based if:**
a. The relevant manufacturing and research and
**development facilities are in South Africa and**
are locally controlled in respect of their operation
to the extent required to ensure **uninterrupted**
**supply to the Defence Force; or**
b. it has other major such facilities in South Africa; and


-----

c. there is **security of uninterrupted supply to**
the Defence Force; and, further,
d. there is an agreement with the Defence Force, if
deemed necessary accompanied by a **govern-**
**ment-to-government agreement, covering**
the security of intellectual property owned by
the Defence Force or being developed under contract from the Defence Force, including no transfer outside South African hands or foreign access
to such intellectual property other in terms of that
agreement or a specific contract;
e. the company demonstrates a real, tangible and
**enduring commitment to:**
i. Adding economic value to South Africa.
ii. Skills development in South Africa.
f. the company is fully compliant with all relevant
South African legislation, except insofar as there may
be a waiver or waivers granted in consideration of
strategic issues.

77. South African-based companies may compete for the de**velopment, manufacture and support of defence ma-**
**tériel in respect of which strategic independence is re-**
quired, and for the development, manufacture and support of all
other equipment, systems, stores and supplies, and will enjoy
**preference over foreign companies, provided that:**
a. Their products and/or services fully meet the re**quirement in all critical respects.**
b. They demonstrate the ability to support that product through its **lifecycle, including such upgrades**
that may be necessitated or required from time to
time.
c. No foreign product demonstrates an overwhelming
advantage over the local product.
d. Their price and long-term support price structure
are:
i. Broadly in line with other offers; or
ii. are considered acceptable given the advantages of local sourcing.

78. In exceptional circumstances South African based companies may be considered for sovereign items, but only within the
framework of contract-specific controls set to ensure sovereign
control of that matériel and the related technologies and intellectual property.

###### FOREIGN-CONTROLLED DEFENCE COMPANIES IN SOUTH AFRICA

79. Local defence companies that are not compliant with the
requirements set out above are not considered to be South


African, partly South African-owned or South African-based in
respect of sovereign equipment or systems or those considered
essential for strategic independence.

80. Such companies:
a. May compete for the development, manufacture
and support of defence matériel, commodities and
services **not considered sovereign or required**
for **strategic independence, and their bids will**
enjoy an advantage over entirely foreign companies
if all else is equal.
b. May be allowed to compete in respect of items
**required for strategic independence, if they**
can show that effective local manufacture and
**support can be established where that is prac-**
ticable, and that such manufacture and long-term
**support can continue despite opposition or even**
prohibition by the government of the country in
which they are headquartered or in which the majority of the ownership resides.

81. All companies wishing to compete for Defence Force
contracts must also have a record, or in the case of newer companies the demonstrated intent, to support the national development agenda as outlined in government policy from time to
time, particularly in respect of a commitment to training and
skills development and to deepening and expanding South Africa’s knowledge and technology base. Their performance and/
or commitment in this respect, with due allowance for variances
in what is practicable in a particular sector and in the case of
smaller companies, will be a factor in evaluating bids.

###### FOREIGN DEFENCE COMPANIES

82. **Local branches of foreign companies may compete**
for the development, manufacture and support of general defence matériel, commodities and services.

83. Where, however, such a local branch is in effect no more
than a marketing or representative office, that company will be
regarded as being a foreign company with no local presence.
Foreign companies with no South African branch may be allowed to compete for such contracts, but may be required to
establish a local branch to manufacture, support or assist with
the support of the relevant defence matériel if the contract is
awarded to them, if:
a. That is important to ensure effective support to the
Defence Force; or
b. there is a major economic impact; and if
c. such establishment is practicable.


-----

84. All foreign suppliers will be required to meet the indus**trial participation requirements set by the Department of**
Defence and the Department of Trade and Industry, as stipulated
by national economic and development policy, as well as other
relevant legislation.

85. **Commitment to supporting South Africa’s national de-**
**velopment agenda will, as in respect of South African-based**
companies, be a factor in evaluating bids.

###### STATE-CONTROLLED OR -OWNED DEFENCE COMPANIES

86. The establishment, development and retention of certain
**defence industrial capabilities will not solely be gov-**
**erned by market forces, due regard being had for strate-**
gic necessity and also for strategic advantage, and particularly
in respect of defence matériel over which sovereign control is
required.

87. **The state may, therefore, retain or establish state-**
**owned enterprises in technology domains that are key**
**to the intent of the defence industry policy and strat-**
**egy, as developed from national security and defence policy ob-**
jectives, but which are **not commercially viable in South**
**Africa.**

88. Where a commercial entity is active in such a technology
domain, but finds it is no longer viable as a business, the state
may:
a. Acquire that entity;
b. acquire control of that entity; or
c. invest in that entity or the relevant portion thereof,
with regard for the protection and control of that
investment.

89. Where the state chooses to acquire control or majority or
full ownership of a company, the owners will be compensated
to a mutually accepted market value, taking into account the
demonstrated and verifiable past investment in the company’s
defence capabilities and technology development made in good
faith by the owners to support the Defence Force.

90. State-owned entities that are potentially viable as commercial enterprises, and that are not engaged in areas that are either
sovereign or otherwise particularly sensitive, may be sold into
private ownership, in whole or in part, provided that there is assurance that this entity will continue with work deemed essential
to the Defence Force.

91. Private defence entities may not be sold, in whole or part,
to foreign entities without the agreement of the Minister of De

fence, which will not be unreasonably withheld. In a case where
the existing owners must divest themselves of their ownership
of a defence industry entity, the state may choose to acquire that
entity or a portion thereof at a mutually accepted market value.

92. Similarly, private defence entities may not close certain capabilities or exit the industry without the agreement of the Minister of Defence. Where existing owners must take such action,
the state may:
a. Enter into an agreement with the owners to support
retention of that capability, or to ensure the survival
of the entity or a part of the entity; or
b. acquire the entity, in whole or part, if applicable,
compensating the owners to a mutually accepted
market value.

93. In some cases where this might be a logical course of action, the state may enter into a public-private partnership arrangement with a defence industry entity, for instance a government-owned/contractor-operated arrangement in respect of a
manufacturing facility.

94. All such acquisitions, disposals or other such arrangements
will be in accordance with the relevant legislation and regulations except where the exigencies of the defence and security
environment might demand a departure, in which case a fair
outcome for the other party will be ensured by negotiation or
arbitration.

###### Denel

95. **Denel is a national security asset, with the pri-**
**mary purpose of designing, developing, manufacturing**
**and supporting defence matériel. In addition thereto, De-**
nel is charged with:
a. The **custodianship of assigned sovereign or**
strategic defence capabilities, technologies and abilities, inclusive of those that may be at risk, the loss
of which would threaten South Africa’s required defence capability.
b. The design, development, manufacture and support of important capabilities which may not be
**commercially viable.**

96. The divisions of Denel are classified as follows:
a. Denel Dynamics – Sovereign.
b. Denel Land Systems – Strategic.
c. Denel Aviation – Strategic.
d. Rheinmetall-Denel Munitions – Strategic.
e. Pretoria Metal Pressings (PMP) – Strategic.
f. Overberg Test Range (OTR) – Strategic.


-----

97. Denel will, in carrying out such projects, make optimal
**use of private South African companies in the defence in-**
dustry and in the wider industrial sector, acting as the prime
**contractor and, where it has the capability to do so, as the**
**system integrator.**

98. The **relationship between the** **Defence Force and**
**Denel will at all times remain a normal contractual one.**

99. Denel may also be contracted by other state entities
to carry out projects that are key to national strategy, suited
to its capabilities and not commercially viable, provided that it
can do so without detriment to its primary purpose.

100. Denel may dispose of, wholly or partially, to private owners such divisions that are not involved in sovereign projects or
deemed essential to strategic independence or key to the intent
of defence industrial policy. The state may allow investors,
local and foreign, **to acquire minority share holdings in**
those divisions in which it chooses to retain majority ownership. Any minority shareholding will be **strictly monitored**
**to ensure security and sovereignty. Due regard will be**
paid in this respect to economic imperatives and foreign policy
objectives.

101. **Consideration should be given to** **establishing a**
**maritime division within Denel to take over the manage-**
ment of the Naval Dockyard (and any other mutually identified
facility) in terms of a properly planned division of both functions
and responsibilities between itself and the Navy.
a. The position of the Dockyard as an entity managed
by Armscor has not produced the hoped for results.
b. Simply transferring it back to the Navy may, however, restrict its ability to carry out work that could reduce the cost of ownership to the Navy; examples
of such other work would include:
i. Refit, repair, modernisation, conversion or
upgrading of naval and coast guard vessels of
other countries, working in conjunction with
industry, in some cases as the prime contractor, in others as a sub-contractor.
ii. Support for the complex vessels of the offshore diamond and gas/oil exploration industries, working in conjunction with specialist
companies in those sectors.

102. The establishment of a **Denel maritime division will**
be an **optimal approach, specifically the application of De-**
nel’s systems engineering capability and its ability to sustain
better upkeep of warships and other naval vessels.

**103. Sovereign** **command and control technology** will


be established within either Denel or a selected South Afri**can-owned company.**

###### Armscor

104. Defence acquisition will be carried out by **Armscor** as
the **defence matériel acquisition agency to ensure the**
necessary compliance in the acquisition of defence matériel
and related stores. Armscor will also assist the Defence Force
to be an **intelligent buyer by, in** **concert with local in-**
**dustry as may be appropriate, conducting, contracting or**
**overseeing:**
a. Evaluation of acquisition, procurement, research,
development and manufacturing models in other
countries.
b. Evaluation of lifecycle management practices in other countries.
c. Research and evaluation in respect of foreign weapons, equipment and systems.
d. The planned and focused development of a science,
engineering and technology support capability:
i. In areas identified as key to the future capability of the Defence Force; and
ii. to support the operations and management of
the Defence Force.

105.  Armscor will, in principle, not develop or manu**facture equipment, nor compete in any way with local**
**industry, but will conduct, contract or coordinate:**
a. Background technology monitoring and research,
to be able to advise the Defence Force and local
industry.
b. Research and development in particularly sensitive
areas (such as chemical, biological and radiological
defence).
c. Research and development in areas in which it is
already engaged (such armour technology).
d. Research and development in niche areas as may be
identified by the Defence Force from time to time.

106. In the event of an urgent operational requirement that
cannot be met by industry, from available resources, Armscor
may, nonetheless, arrange and oversee development and manufacture, by sub-contractors or in-house.

107. **Armscor has the additional function of** **supporting**
**and assisting the development of the South African**
**defence industry and its capabilities. In this respect Arm-**
scor will work with the Defence Force and the industry to develop acquisition, procurement and logistic/technical support
strategies that:
a. Ensure optimal acquisition, procurement and support for the Defence Force.


-----

b. Support the national strategy to develop and
strengthen the defence industry.
c. Support South African defence industry market
penetration.


b. Ownership, use and transfer of background and
foreground intellectual property.
c. Ownership, use and transfer of defence intellectual
property created or developed, including the coownership relationship.
d. Management of indivisible defence intellectual
property.
e. The modification, altering, development, amendment or enhancement of defence intellectual
property.
f. The registration of patents.
g. Royalties arising or payable from defence intellectual
property.
h. Right of use or licence to use defence intellectual
property.
i. Third party transfer of defence intellectual property;
j. Loss or unlawful use of defence intellectual property;
k. Sale or change of ownership of defence intellectual
property.
l. Management of defence intellectual property under
instances of joint ventures, alliances and sale of company equity.
m. Measures of protection and confidentiality.
n. Safekeeping and general military security arrangements concerning defence intellectual property.
o. Arms control, dual-use and non-proliferation
considerations.
p. Procedures to manage or dispose of redundant defence intellectual property.
q. Settlement of disputes.

112. In some instances defence intellectual property **may be**
**further regulated by binding bilateral instruments con-**
cluded on a **government-to-government basis to either**
regulate all intellectual property exchanged between the two
countries or to regulate the management of specific intellectual
property related to a particular government-to-government
transaction.

113. The ownership of all and any intellectual property in
respect of any defence matériel or technology developed under
a direct government defence contract or indirectly as part of a direct government defence contract, will reside with defence,
unless specifically ceded to another body or person, regardless
of any patents that may be lodged.

114. Where the cost of development was shared by the
developing company, companies or individuals, the ownership
of the resulting intellectual property will be held pro rata by
defence and those companies or individuals as determined in
**the relevant contractual agreement(s), which will cover,**
inter alia, the required levels of sovereignty and secrecy, the use
of background technology, the future transfer of such intellectual


##### DEFENCE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY


108. **Defence intellectual property may, in the main, be**
**created or developed by:**
a. Investment and product development in the course
of an acquisition or procurement programme;
b. investment in a dedicated research and development
programme in pursuit of defence science, engineering and technology objectives; or
c. investment arising from the Defence Industrial
programme.

109. For the purposes of this section, **defence intellectual**
**property means:**

_Any intellectual property that is created exclusively or par-_
_tially with defence funds, and may be found in, or take the_
_form of, books, manuscripts, reports and notes, computer_
_software, inventions, drawings and designs, data items,_
_data packs, specifications, models, photographs, trade-_
_marks and other graphical images._

_Defence intellectual property includes intellectual property_
_that is created through indirect contracting, such as con-_
_tracts made by the other party with a sub-contractor, as_
_well as intellectual property that is obtained or created ex-_
_clusively or partially through the Defence Industrial Partici-_
_pation (DIP) programme or other contracts or co-opera-_
_tions of the Defence Force with foreign entities or countries,_
_where the Defence Force and/or the other party are legally_
_entitled to the intellectual property._

110. **The management of defence intellectual prop-**
**erty will be broadly guided by a Defence Force policy,**
**through contractual arrangements undertaken to regulate**
acquisition and research and development projects. Intellectual
property may be further regulated by means of patent reg**istration as may be decided on a case-by-case basis.**

111. The above places the burden on the state to ensure sig**nificant rigour concerning the management of defence intel-**
lectual property in future defence matériel contracts. Such
contracts may, based on the merit of each transaction, address
**important defence intellectual property considerations**
including but not limited to the following:
a. Management of commercial background and foreground intellectual property.


-----

property and the matter of royalties. Defence intellectual property that is brought into South Africa by a company, or is created
or developed by a company using its own funding, remains the
property of that company.

115. The Defence Force will not divest itself of such intellectual
property except with the agreement of the Minister of Defence
that so doing does not present a strategic risk. The Minister of
Defence, advised by the Secretary for Defence and the CEO of
Armscor, will decide on the management of intellectual property related to defence matériel deemed sovereign or critical to
strategic independence.

116. The **CEO of Armscor is the** **responsible author-**
**ity for the day-to-day management** of all Defence Forceowned intellectual property.

117. In managing its intellectual property, defence will keep
foremost in mind that an excessive emphasis on royalties
**will hamper the ability of the South African defence**
**industry to penetrate other defence markets. The**
**royalties to be levied will, therefore, not exceed accepted**
**international market trends and best practice. Where**
levying royalties would endanger the conclusion of export contracts, consideration will be given to waiving such royalties in
favour of concluding such contracts and furthering South African
penetration of the international defence market, with the resulting intrinsic benefits to the Defence Force.

118. As a general principle the Defence Force will not patent its
intellectual property, as that would:
a. Entail considerable and ongoing cost.
b. Compromise the security of the technologies, processes or products concerned.

119. The Defence Force will, instead, ensure the protection of
its intellectual property by implementing:
a. Best practice in the management of trade secrets.
b. National secrecy and security provisions.


tary nature, seeking interested parties for re-investment in defence industry, product enhancement, defence research or in
skills development relevant to defence or aligned with emerging defence requirements. Government will also encourage the
exchange of ideas between defence companies and companies
in other but related fields, to make a contribution to the wider
dissemination of knowledge and skills in South Africa.

122. The only restriction in this respect will be that security
considerations are taken fully into account, with the release of
technologies and the exchange of personnel required to be approved by the Defence Force in any case where confidential
matters are involved.


##### DEFENCE INDUSTRY STRATEGY


##### TECHNOLOGY SPIN-OFF


120. The spin-off of capabilities and technologies from
the defence industry and the defence research institutes into
the wider South African economy and industry will be
**encouraged and supported.**

121. **Royalty arrangements will be managed contractu-**
**ally** by the CEO of Armscor in close consultation with defence to extract optimal value from existing technology. The
preferred method of value-generation will be of a non-mone

###### DEFENCE STRATEGIC TRAJECTORY – FIVE MILESTONES

123. The Defence Strategic Trajectory (Chapter 9 of this
Defence Review) posits the following critical milestones to develop the defence capabilities that South Africa requires, namely:

a. **Milestone 1: Arrest the decline in criti-**
cal capabilities through immediate and directed
interventions.

b. **Milestone 2: Reorganise and rebalance the**
Defence Force as the foundation for future growth.

c. **Milestone 3: Create a** **sustainable Defence**
**Force that can meet ordered defence commit-**
ments (interim end-state of the Defence Review).

d. **Milestone 4: Enhance the Defence Force’s** **ca-**
**pacity to respond to emerging threats (end-**
state of the Defence Review).

e. **Milestone 5: Defend the Republic against an im-**
minent or dire threat.

###### PHASES FOR THE DEFENCE INDUSTRY STRATEGY

124. A defence industry sector strategy will be devel**oped that will: meet the critical defence needs; add substance**
to South Africa’s deterrent posture; add substance to South
Africa’s standing as a country; and provide the ability to utilise
defence equipment sales in support of foreign policy. The five
**overlapping phases set out below, which set out the broad**
**concept for the development of the** **national defence in-**
**dustrial strategy, and is broadly aligned to the five mile-**
**stones of the Defence Strategic Trajectory. These are:**

a.    Phase 1: Measures to retain selected capabili

-----

**ties** and capacities at risk and the consolidation of
the existing state-owned capacities.

b.    Phase 2: Ensure sustainment of those capabilities and capacities.

c.    Phase 3: Support the **economic turn-around**
of South African and South African-based defence
companies.

d.   Phase 4: Create conditions for further devel**opment of the South African defence industry, in**
cooperation, where that is relevant and practicable,
with the DTI, to support the establishment and development of downstream industries.

e.   Phase 5: Recover, recreate or develop sover**eign capabilities under South African ownership.**

125. While these milestones are essentially sequential, they
will **in some cases** be **overlapping or interlocking. The**
implementation of this strategy will be carried out in step with
the development and implementation of the acquisition and procurement policies set out above.

_Figure 15-1: Key Targets across the Defence Strategic Trajectory_


###### PHASE 1: SECURE EXISTING CAPABILITIES

126. The first step towards achieving the desired defence industrial capability is to secure the existing capabilities and
**capacities as a** **base from which to expand. This phase**
will centre on placing short-term contracts locally that are
focused on:
a. **Ensuring the** **immediate survival of particular**
companies.
b. **Ensuring the immediate retention of particular**
capabilities and capacities.
c. **Meeting identified requirements of the De-**
fence Force.
d. **Underpinning pending and potential export**
orders.

127. Such contracts will include orders for:
a. **Refurbishment of existing equipment that it is**
intended to keep in service.
b. **Upgrading and** **modernising certain** **defence**
**matériel.**


-----

c. **Replenishment** of **reserve** **ammunition**
**stocks and spares.**
d. **Continuing existing** **research and** **develop-**
**ment projects.**

128. Defence may also assist key companies financially to ensure their immediate survival and/or to upgrade facilities. Such
assistance must be provided within the regulations of the Public Finance Management Act or in terms of a waiver of those
regulations.

###### PHASE 2: SUSTAIN EXISTING CAPABILITIES

129. The second milestone is to ensure the sustainability of the
identified defence companies. This will be done by means of:
a. Placing multi-year contracts for identified items
that are **required for training (eg munitions,**
spares) or to replenish the reserve stocks of the
Defence Force.
b. Placing multi-year contracts for the support of
defence matériel in service.
c. Placing multi-year contracts to meet immediate
and near-term defence matériel needs of the Defence Force, in some cases in phased batches to
enable the Defence Force to coherently **rebuild**
**certain capabilities while simultaneously provid-**
ing industry with an extended order book.
d. Adopting an **acquisition strategy that makes**
maximum use of **common systems to achieve**
**greater interoperability and** **easier support**
**in the field on the one hand and greater econo-**
**mies of scale on the other. This strategy will not,**
however, be allowed to place commonality above
mission utility.
e. **Informing local companies of** **planned acquisi-**
**tions** and likely budgets, to enable them to plan
ahead and invest appropriately.
f. **Expanding the present levels of** **research and**
**development (R&D) funding and ensuring**
**alignment of R&D projects with Defence Force**
**priorities and, insofar as is practicable, with wider**
national R&D imperatives and goals.
g. Actively **supporting exports of defence maté-**
riel in production and upgrading of systems and
equipment already in service with other forces;
h. Establishing and supporting relevant ‘centres of
**excellence’.**
i. Supporting relevant **undergraduate,** **post-**
**graduate and technical courses at South African**
**universities and other** **tertiary educational**
**establishments.**


###### PHASE 3: SUPPORT THE TURN-AROUND

130. The third milestone is intended to support a turn-around
of the industry aimed at ensuring its long-term viability. This will
be achieved within identified existing capabilities and within capabilities that can be quickly and efficiently established:
a. Giving the Defence Force **medium-term and**
**long-term authority to commit funds to equip-**
ment projects and programmes.
b. **Standardising on platforms in production or**
about to enter production to extend production and
facilitate through-life support, albeit not favouring
commonality at the expense of mission-suitability.
c. Adopting a **half-generation change-over poli-**
**cy for equipping the defence force. This will guard**
against block obsolescence and give both the Defence Force and the industry the benefit of predictable longer production runs.
d. **Extending orders for in-production equipment**
and systems and items about to go into production,
to equip approximately half of the existing fleet or
envisaged fleet in each case.
e. Actively supporting the export of equipment
that is in current production for the Defence Force.
f. Making visible the Defence Force’s medium-term
and long-term requirements to the industry, ideally
by establishing a **Capital Expenditure State-**
**ment as a public document in respect of all but**
specifically sensitive projects and envisaged funding
levels.
g. **Supporting local development of equipment**
**and systems to meet requirements that have**
been identified and largely defined, insofar as this is
both practicable and financially sensible.
h. **Supporting joint ventures with foreign defence**
companies and countries.
i. **Guiding and** **supporting industry-funded re-**
**search and development to meet future re-**
quirements and to pursue some potentially relevant
**‘blue sky’ concepts.**

###### PHASE 4: SUPPORT FUTURE DEVELOPMENT

131. The fourth milestone is intended to **establish a base**
**from which the industry will be able to develop into**
**the future and expand its capabilities. This will be**
achieved by identifying jointly with the industry those ar**eas into which the industry can logically expand and then sup-**
port that expansion:
a. To meet identified sovereign and strategic independence requirements;


-----

b. where there are sufficiently substantial local
requirements;
c. where there is sufficient export or joint venture potential; or
d. where there is substantial potential for valuable spinoffs into the economy.

132. Export and joint venture potential, together with local requirements, exists in several fields, including guided weapons,
artillery systems and areas of electronic warfare, and can be
recreated in the field of tactical communications systems if that
capability is restored.

133. Areas of potentially substantial economic spin-off exist in
software development and in the local manufacture of various
MOTS items required by the Defence Force that also have civilian applications.

###### PHASE 5: REPOSITION SOVEREIGN CAPABILITIES

134. Where capabilities that have been identified as requir**ing sovereign control are in fact controlled by foreign com-**
panies, government will either:
a. Acquire those capabilities from their owners at a mutually agreed market value; and in accordance with
the relevant legislation and regulations, or,
b. failing that, re-establish the necessary capabilities
within DENEL and/or one or more South Africanowned companies.

135. In either case this will be accompanied by a focused
**programme to develop the skills base required for this to be**
done effectively and efficiently, where possible drawing back into
the industry South African individuals with relevant expertise and
experience to lay the foundation and to mentor their successors.


##### KEY INDUSTRY CAPABILITY AREAS


136. The following sections set out in outline the minimum requirement for primary industrial capability. These capability areas
apply particularly in respect of the key technology domains identified above, but are also cross-cutting in respect of all defence
technology domains.

###### EQUIPMENT AND SYSTEMS SUPPORT

137. This refers to a coherent system of through-life sys**tem management, from acquisition to disposal, including:**
a. Support during the acquisition of foreign-sourced
matériel.
b. Commissioning equipment and systems into service.
c. Routine maintenance and overhaul.


d. Battle damage, operational damage and accident
repair.
e. Controlled long-term storage and re-commissioning
after extended storage.
f. Decommissioning and disposal.
g. Support for equipment passed on to other armed
forces in the context of defence diplomacy in congruence with foreign policy and national security objectives to develop a system of closer defence ties
within the SADC and the continent.

###### SUPPORT TO MILITARY OPERATIONS

138. An important issue is the ability of the industry to support
**key equipment in the field. This may require the deploy-**
**ment of civilian industry staff into an operational area**
**or on operations. In such cases:**
a. Civilian members of defence industry companies
who deploy with South African forces on an operation will be appointed to the Reserve for the duration
of that deployment, in an acting rank commensurate
with their posts and responsibilities. This will ensure
that all South African personnel fall under a single legal system and that such industry staff enjoy the protections accorded to military personnel in the event
of capture by opposing forces or arrest by neutral
forces. They will be issued, on a temporary basis,
with appropriate clothing and personal equipment,
which may include firearms if this is considered necessary. Such appointment will not in any way affect
their rights and duties in terms of applicable labour
legislation except insofar as required in terms of the
conduct and security of operations and to ensure
their safety.
b. The Defence Force will be responsible for the transport, protection, accommodation and subsistence
of such company staff to and within the operational
area, with those costs being for its account, to be
charged against the cost of the operation concerned.
Defence industry staff deployed in an operational
area will be required to adhere to all instructions issued by the local command in respect of movement
and security.
c. To cater for inherent risks of being deployed to an
operational area, special measures must be developed to ensure due care and adequate compensation in the event of injury or loss of life.

###### CRITICAL MUNITIONS AND RELATED MATTERS

139. This refers particularly but not exclusively to:
a. All munitions likely to be used in large quantities,


-----

munitions for **locally developed weapons, and**
**specialised munitions with limited shelf-life.**
b. **Specialised batteries for, among other things:**
communications and other electronic equipment;
missiles, torpedoes and other guided weapons; and
remotely operated systems.

###### HIGH RATE-OF-USE SPARES AND CRITICAL STORES

140. This refers to, among other things:
a. Spares for weapons, weapon systems and **un-**
**manned systems.**
b. Spares for communications and other electron**ic equipment.**
c. Spares for combat vehicles and tactical logistic
**vehicles.**
d. Spares for combat and transport rotary-wing and
**fixed-wing aircraft.**
e. Spares for naval vessels.
f. Replacement filters for respiratory (individual and
collective) equipment.
g. **Pharmaceuticals, medical stores, decontami-**
nation chemicals and stores, and spares for medical equipment.
h. **Field rations, uniforms and general** **field**
**equipment.**

141. It is necessary to keep in mind that some of these spares
and stores will be expended in the course of disaster aid and
similar operations.

###### SYSTEM INTEGRATION

142. A system integration capability critically allows
the Defence Force to **acquire optimal sub-systems and**
**equipment from different suppliers in order to:**
a. Develop **optimised equipment and systems**
without the cost of developing sub-systems.
b. **Deploy and support equipment and systems;**
c. **Integrate complex system environments with**
other systems to construct a ‘system of systems’.
d. Develop system backbones or links to **facilitate**
**interoperability among forces.**
e. **Modernise,** **upgrade and** **convert equipment**
and systems optimally.

143. The system integration capability must include the ability
**to independently:**
a. Integrate precision weapons and related systems
with in-service and future platforms.


b. Modify key missile (and related system) algorithms,
for example those governing guidance and control,
attack profiles and electronic counter-counter-measures capability.
c. Integrate unmanned systems with other in-service
and future systems.

###### EQUIPMENT MODERNISATION AND UPGRADE

144. Most modern platforms (aircraft, ships and vehicles) and
systems have a service life of twenty to thirty years, thus requiring the Defence Force to modernise and upgrade such
**systems to ensure** **optimal effectiveness and to** **meet**
**evolving threats. Having the ability within the country to**
modernise, upgrade and convert equipment and systems allows
the Defence Force to optimally manage its equipment both in
terms of its utility and in terms of cost-effectiveness.

145. This capability is in many respects a combination of
the ability to support equipment and of a systems integration
capability.

###### CRITICAL EQUIPMENT AND SYSTEMS

146. Critical equipment and systems are those that are essen**tial to the conduct of operations or those which can pro-**
**vide a useable tactical edge. Examples include:**
a. **Secure communications systems.**
b. **Information operations systems.**
c. **Electronic warfare systems.**
d. **Reconnaissance and** **intelligence collection,**
management and evaluation systems.
e. **Precision weapons, including missiles and guided**
and homing bombs and projectiles, and particularly
low cost, man-portable and low-collateral-damage
weapons, and fire direction systems.

147. Having the ability to develop, manufacture and support
such systems will also provide the capability to optimise them
to suit the Defence Force’s needs.

###### OPTIMISED EQUIPMENT AND SYSTEMS

148. The operational environment and the operational
**style of the Defence Force are such that there is a require-**
**ment for optimised systems and equipment in some de-**
fence capability areas, and real potential advantage to be gained
in others. It will not be practicable to autonomously develop
optimised equipment in all cases, but it will be possible to do so:
a. Where the numbers required justify local devel**opment and industrialisation.**


-----

b. In partnership with original equipment
**manufacturers.**

###### UNMANNED SYSTEMS

149. The **strategic, operational and tactical potential**
**of unmanned systems is advancing and expanding at a signifi-**
cant rate. The Defence Force must make optimal use of such
systems and understand the impact on own forces operations
of such systems in the hands of opposing forces. The Defence
Force will draw on technical and scientific advice to:
a. Evaluate and monitor **developments in un-**
**manned systems and related technologies at the**
strategic, operational and tactical levels.
b. Develop service-level and joint unmanned systems
**doctrines and strategies.**
c. Work with the defence industry, the relevant research and development bodies and the relevant
government departments to develop and imple**ment a national unmanned systems strategy**
to cover:
i. The employment of unmanned systems, including integration at relevant levels.
ii. The acquisition, integration and support of unmanned systems.
iii. The development and production of unmanned systems in South Africa.

###### LARGE-SCALE ACQUISITION OF CIVILIAN-STANDARD EQUIPMENT

150. There is a good logic for manufacturing locally, without necessarily developing locally, normal **civilian standard**
**equipment that must be acquired or procured in large**
**numbers or quantities. Quite apart from military advantage,**
this will further job creation and sustainment, reduce import expenditure and also potentially lead to export earnings.

###### CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL AND RADIOLOGICAL DEFENCE

151. South Africa does not intend to use, acquire or develop
chemical, biological or radiological (or nuclear) weapons; nor
is there any near-term likelihood of South Africa becoming involved in armed conflict with a country that has such weapons.
It is, however, necessary for South Africa to conduct research
**and development work in this field in order to be able to:**
a. **Understand the risks and dangers involved;**
b. develop the necessary intelligence collection and
sensor technologies to guard against such attack;


c. acquire or develop and manufacture **protective**
**equipment and clothing for critical facilities,**
emergency response teams and military personnel;
d. acquire or develop and manufacture relevant inocu**lations, antidotes and supportive medicines**
for personnel who may be exposed to such agents;
or weapons
e. acquire or develop and manufacture **decontami-**
**nation equipment and materials.**

152. The responsibility for ensuring that the necessary capabilities are to hand is that of the Defence Force. It is, therefore, also
the responsibility of the Defence Force to initiate, fund
**and support the necessary research to allow effective and**
efficient acquisition and/or development and manufacture of
the necessary equipment, clothing and medicines. All research,
development, manufacture, production and storage carried
out in respect of this requirement will be carried out in strict
**compliance with South Africa’s relevant international**
**treaty obligations and the related national legislation and**
**regulations.**

###### GENERAL COMMODITIES

153. The Defence Force requires various general commodities and civilian-standard equipment in large quantities and numbers. While there is no critical need to manufacture such items
in South Africa, this can make economic sense in some cases,
and particularly so when there is also a substantial civilian market
for the same or an essentially similar item. There may be a particular opportunity here to support small and micro-businesses
and military veterans, especially where there is logic to procuring
particular commodities from businesses in the immediate area of
a Defence Force base.


154. The success of the defence industry will be its **integra-**
**tion into mainstream South African industrial policy**
as a distinct and supported sector in the wider indus**trial base. Defence thus has an onerous responsibility to work**
together with all stakeholders towards this end, and specifically
the integration of the defence industry sector into the Industrial
Policy Action Plan, and any subsequent amendment. The next
iteration of the National Development Plan should include the
Defence Industry as part of South Africa’s national industrial base.

155. The future defence industry strategy will be de**veloped by the National Defence Industry Council,**
drawing on the expertise within the Defence Force, the Defence


##### CONCLUSION


-----

Secretariat and the defence acquisition agent, and in conjunction
with the industry and with inputs from the Department of Trade
and Industry and the Department of Science and Technology.
This strategy will be **updated as required to take into ac-**
count the evolving strategic situation and developments
**in defence technology and the international** **defence in-**
**dustrial environment.**

156. The implementation of this strategy will be carried
out in step with the development and implementation of the acquisition and procurement policies. The strategy will further be
**aligned and interlinked with government’s wider eco-**
**nomic and industrial development strategies, including:**
a. Support for small business enterprises.
b. Furthering the general BBBEE and military veterans
policies as they develop.
c. Inclusion of the defence industry as a sector in its
own right in the IPAP of the DTI, rather than jointly
with Aerospace (IPAP 2012/13 – 2014/15, Paragraph 14.17) and specific recognition of and support
for realising this sector’s potential in respect of:
i. Exploiting new opportunities created by
South-South cooperation (IPAP, 12.1.2).
ii. Potential for development of long-term advanced capabilities (IPAP, Cluster 3) and specifically 14.15 “advanced manufacturing” and
14.16 “advanced materials”.
iii. In relation to other sectors, including:
(1) Metal fabrication and boat-building
(Cluster 1), including the potential for
the development of a comprehensive
ship-building sector.
(2) Automotive products and components,


and medium and heavy commercial vehicles (Cluster 2).
(3) Aerospace, electro-technical and ICT
(Cluster 3).
d. Inclusion of the defence industry in the DTI’s
Manufacturing Competitiveness Enhancement Programme (MCEP).
e. Aligning, without sacrificing strategic independence,
the Defence Force acquisition strategy with:
i. The Preferential Procurement Policy Framework Act.
ii. The Competitive Supplier Development Programme (CSDP) of the DTI.
iii. The Technology Localisation Programme of
the Department of Science and Technology.
f. Inclusion of the defence industry in the Support
Programme for Industrial Innovation (SPII) of the

on Defence (1996) and the Defence Review (1998). The 1996

## DETERMINING THE LEVEL OF    DEFENCE AMBITION


##### INTRODUCTION


###### Perennial Defence Questions

1. All governments across the world face similar questions
when attempting to identify their national defence requirements:
a. What is the nature of the current and future security
and defence environment?
b. What international role does the country aspire to?
c. What regional and continental role does the country
aspire to?
d. When and how should ‘hard’ and ‘soft’ power be
deployed, including military power?
e. What work will accordingly be required of defence?
f. What must defence be able to at a stretch?
g. What should defence not do?
h. When required to do all things at all times, which
tasks could be done in alliance with other countries
and what capabilities will be required as a result?
i. What risks must government be prepared to take,
since government cannot insure against every imaginable risk?
j. Consequently, how much is the nation prepared to
pay for security and the resources defence requires?
k. How should defence be structured, organised and
equipped to best fulfil requirements within resource
constraints?

###### National Defence Intent

2. An analysis of the above questions is intended to lead to a
common understanding of the level of defence required by the
country, of a realistic national defence requirement and how it is
to be satisfied – a National Defence Intent. The essential elements of this are an understanding of, and agreement on, what is
expected of defence, how this is to be achieved and what broad
capabilities this would require. These are captured, expressed
and elaborated on in the Defence Review, which is government’s highest-level policy statement on defence.


###### The Defence Review

3. The Defence Review must express government’s intent
for defence in a way that enables lower-level defence planning.
As such it must:
a. Highlight key aspects of the environment impacting
on defence – the context for defence planning;
b. Outline South Africa’s national security policy – a vital
governance factor in defence planning;
c. Discuss the mandate, missions and roles of defence
and the priorities accorded to various tasks in order
to support national security policy – statutory and
policy governance factors;
d. Define the defence outcomes to be pursued in terms
of national security policy – the ends of defence;
e. Detail the corresponding strategic defence concept
and strategic capabilities – the Ways and Means of
Defence;
f. Give strategic guidelines on all of the above for lower-level defence planning.

4. It is only when defence intent has been unpacked to the
level of detail where the resource and cost implications become
visible, that it will become evident whether the stated level of
intent is feasible, or not. If the allocated or anticipated resources
are insufficient to establish and sustain the capabilities required by
the stated defence intent, adjustments to the defence requirement, the defence concept or the resource allocation, or a combination of these will be required to establish a balance between
intent and resources.


5. The level of defence ambition is an expression of national
security policy and government’s foreign policy, understood
within the context of the defence mandate, as derived from the
statutory framework governing defence, particularly the constitutional functions of defence. All these factors form the governance framework within which defence ambition and the corresponding defence requirements must be determined.


##### ESTABLISHING THE LEVEL OF DEFENCE AMBITION


-----

6. In addition, the level of defence ambition and requirement
is context-dependent. This comprises the geostrategic setting
for defence, as derived from environmental analyses and intelligence appreciations, and scenarios at a strategic and defence
level.

7. Subject to the governance factors and within context, defence intent comprises three broad issues:
a. Defence outcomes – the objectives to be pursued
by defence – the ENDS of defence.
b. Defence mission, strategic goals, tasks and concepts
– the WAYS of defence.
c. Defence capability cequirements – the broad capabilities and force levels required to and achieve the
outcomes – the MEANS of defence.

8. The defence mandate derived from the Constitution is a
general statement of purpose, covering the full spectrum of possible defence employment. The functions listed in the Constitution stipulate the purposes for which the Defence Force may
be employed. This needs to be qualified in the light of environmental circumstances and the national security policy, government priorities and the availability of resources.

9. Defence will thus not be expected to become involved in
every possible contingency. Involvement in many contingencies
will be discretionary and complete categories could be eliminated as a matter of policy, based on their extreme unlikelihood,
resource constraints, government priorities or other considerations. The defence outcomes are a function of the sub-set of
contingencies defence will be expected to deal with and reflect
the ends government wishes to achieve through defence involvement in the selected contingencies.

10. The defence concept broadly describes the way by which
the defence outcomes will be pursued. It includes the priority
accorded to various contingencies or classes of contingencies,
guidelines on concurrency and whether capabilities must enable
an autonomous or collaborative response (either bi- or multilateral).

11. The defence capability requirement is a statement of the
level of operational capability that would be required by or
committed to a particular contingency or class of contingencies,
in accordance with the defence outcomes and defence concept. Since it involves broad classes of threat, within hypothetical futures, only broad statements of requirement are possible.
These will nevertheless give valuable guidance to lower-level
defence planning.

12. The level of defence ambition is thus contained within the
Defence Review and elaborates on the types and objectives of


operations, missions and tasks envisaged in selected situations,
broad guidelines concerning the conduct of such operations, including guidelines concerning concurrency, and the capabilities
required for such operations. It is a vital high-level policy guideline for all defence planning and must be the subject of consensus between government and defence, and of great importance
within defence itself.


##### ‘GEO-STRATEGIC & DEFENCE SCENARIOS’ – A TOOL TO DETERMINE DEFENCE AMBITION


###### Environmental Scan and Intelligence Appreciations

13. While the future is inevitably shrouded in uncertainty, it
is impossible to plan defence capabilities without some idea of
how the future might develop. The first stage of this work is
therefore to review national and defence intelligence appreciations and environmental analyses to determine the main characteristics and trends that are observed in the environment.
This work reflects on relevant environmental characteristics and
trends at the global, continental, regional and domestic levels.

###### Strategic Scenarios

14. The characteristics and trends identified during the environmental analysis give an indication of possible future developments but cannot accurately predict the future. The way
in which trends develop and the interaction between factors
inevitably introduce uncertainty. Even if the environment remains relatively stable, the future can therefore develop along a
spectrum of alternative pathways. This will impact on defence
requirements. Defence planning must therefore take account
of alternative futures.

15. The use of scenarios is an accepted way of accommodating and preparing for such alternative futures in a planning
process. Scenarios are purpose-specific and are constructed
around those drivers affecting the issue under investigation.
Strategic scenarios reflecting relevant trends and possible highlevel developments identified in the environmental scan were
therefore written to create alternative contexts for deliberations
on defence capabilities.

16. Strategic scenarios were developed to reflect the emerging environment. These are:
a. Status Quo – A Continuation of the Current Trajectory.
b. Africa Arising – An Optimistic Future.
c. Regression – A Pessimistic Future.


-----

17. Each scenario was developed in summary and detailed format to sketch various contexts within which events requiring a
defence response could occur. The scenarios are dealt with in
detail in a separate report.

18. It is important to note that the futures described in the
scenarios are entirely hypothetical but were considered plausible in light of current environmental analyses and intelligence
appreciations. They were not predictions, ie statements regarding what will happen within some bounds of probability, but are
statements about the spectrum within which the future might
develop. They also did not include extreme events that would
dramatically alter the defence landscape, such as a melt-down of
the global political and/or economic system, catastrophic longterm environmental disruption or widespread and hostile major
power involvement in Africa.

19. Extreme events are not impossible. The most extreme –
major meteorite strikes and eruptions of mega-volcanoes that affected all life on Earth – have occurred in geological time and are
possible, even probable, in the future. However, such events
alter the security landscape to such an extent that the “rules of
the game” are redefined. A direct major power threat to South
Africa would be such an event, implying a significant strategic
re-alignment. While it is valid to ask “what if?” regarding such
events, planning that is actually implementable within available
resources must proceed from more constrained visions of the
future. The above scenarios represent such a vision.

###### Consequent Defence Scenarios

20. Events requiring the deployment of military forces do not
occur in a vacuum. The strategic scenarios provide context to
such events. Levels of threat involving combinations of target
and source, compatible with the strategic scenarios, are therefore identified to describe plausible manifestations of events or
conflict that might occur within the particular strategic scenario.
The spectrum of plausible contingencies represents a defence
scenario compatible with the strategic scenario.

21. This two-step approach, working from strategic scenarios
to compatible defence scenarios, is not unique to South Africa.
References to a similar approach have been found in literature
regarding the Australian, Swedish and Bulgarian defence planning
processes.

22. To illustrate the relationship between scenarios at the
strategic and defence levels: Given a strategic scenario of relative political stability, advancing democracy and economic development at a regional level – the Africa Arising scenario – a
state-based threat against South Africa is highly unlikely but overt
armed conflict might still be possible in parts of Africa. Similarly,
within the same strategic scenario, an intra-state defence sce

25. The defence intent framework is a mechanism to give
structure to the deliberation of defence requirements. In the
absence of such a structure it is extremely difficult to coherently
debate the complex relationships between all the factors that will
influence a decision on defence capabilities. Deliberations can
easily zoom in on a highly unlikely worst-case scenario or some
pressing current concern, to the exclusion of many important
but less dramatic contingencies. A framework such as this makes
it possible to trace a logic in terms of the whole picture.

26. The framework consists of two sub-frameworks, one designed to investigate the inter-state dimension, the other the
intra-state dimension. Each sub-framework lists a spectrum of
possible threats, from those that involve low levels of violence
or threats of natural origin, to those involving extreme violence
such as civil war within a country or total war between states.
The second dimension of the frameworks lists the locus or focus
of a threat and, in some cases, whether the source would be African or non-African. A combination of a particular level of threat
and a focus/source combination describe a contingency that may
require a defence response.

27. The framework is used in the first place to identify possible
defence contingencies that would be plausible within the strategic
scenarios. The set of contingencies compatible with a strategic
scenario represents the corresponding defence scenario. Each
contingency must be considered in terms of the possible defence
response, the scale of the response, the priority accorded to it,
and various other factors to enable a decision on whether provision for such a contingency should be included in the Strategic
Intent. These deliberations will determine where the focus of
defence effort should be, what level of capability would be required and what provision should be made for future develop

nario of general civil conflict in South Africa is highly unlikely, but
general threats to human security will still exist and might be a
serious threat to some countries.

23. Each contingency implies a possible level of military involvement, including SANDF involvement. Potential SANDF
involvement could thus include participation in multilateral
peace missions, direct defence of South Africa, an autonomous
intervention, and so forth. During the process the motivations
and qualifications relating to each contingency and the possible
modes of SANDF involvement should therefore be noted.

24. The collection of such plausible contingencies comprises
the defence scenario for the corresponding strategic scenario.
The same process of analysis is thus conducted for each strategic
scenario.


##### DEFENCE AMBITION FRAMEWORK & METHODOLOGY


-----

ments. These conclusions, guidelines and motivations form the
basis for the policy that will direct detailed defence planning.

28. While the conceptual approach and the output of the process must inevitably be presented to defence principals and decision-makers, there is a risk in exposing the finer mechanics in
a forum where conditions preclude discussion in sufficient depth
to create a full understanding. People are very likely to differ on
or misunderstand aspects of the structure, definition or content
of a framework or model. Understanding and agreement that
have taken days or weeks to achieve among staff intimately involved in developing and using such a tool, cannot be created in
minutes. If the presenter is not totally au fait with the tool and
the content and/or is not given sufficient time to properly explain, misconceptions will inevitably be formed. Once formed,
such misconceptions are very difficult to correct and can undermine the credibility of the entire exercise. This is not just true of
this framework, it is a reality that should be borne in mind when
any complex analysis is presented to decision-makers.

29. This is emphatically not a mechanistic, paint-by-numbers
process. It requires high levels of judgment and important decisions on strategic guidelines for further planning, but in giving
structure to deliberations on intent, it will contribute to convergence on this key issue.


###### INTER-STATE FRAMEWORK

30. The inter-state framework reflects the spectrum of possible scenarios for inter-state threats and is intended to facilitate
discussion on an appropriate South African defence ambition
regarding such threats, whether they involve South Africa, its
external interests, other African countries and/or non-African
states. The levels of threat included are as follows (verbatim
from Figure D-1):
a. **Political and Economic Conflict: Alliances,**
propaganda, economic and political cooperation/
sanctions, military cooperation and/or assistance.
Conflict management through negotiation, mediation, arbitration.
b. **Sub-National Conflict: Boycotts, seizures, vio-**
lations of territorial integrity, assassination, acts of
terror, sabotage, hostage-taking, state-sponsored
plundering of resources, training, advice and military
assistance.
c. **Overt Armed Conflict: Sporadic armed clashes,**
skirmishes, raids and temporary incursions by conventional forces. Limited ends rather than major
change in status quo. (Examples: Libya-Egypt 1977,
Mali-Burkina Faso 1985, Mauritania-Senegal 198991).


_Figure D-1: Defence Intent Framework: Inter-State Dimension_


-----

d. **Limited War: Protracted, sustained operations by**
conventional forces, partial/temporary invasion, intent to affect significant change in status quo such as
regime change or annexation of territory. (Examples:
Ogaden War 1977-78, Ethiopia-Eritrea War 19982000).
e. **General/Total War: Full mobilisation, war in all**
dimensions, intent to invade, occupy and conquer,
complete change in international order. (No examples globally since WWII).

31. The above threats may be directed at:
a. South Africa.
b. South Africa’s external interests.
c. Another African country.
i. SADC.
ii. Non-SADC.
d. A non-African country.

32. The source of threat may be African or external. The reason for this distinction is that the defence capability and logistical
implications of inter-continental force projection are considerable, implying a superpower or coalition of major powers as
source.

33. The framework is depicted in Figure D-1.

_Figure D-2: Defence Intent Framework: Intra-State Dimension_


###### INTRA-STATE FRAMEWORK

34. The structure of the intra-state framework is conceptually
identical to that of the inter-state framework. The rows in the
table describe various levels of potential threat to security, from
low-level threats of both natural and human origin, to full civil
war. The threat spectrum is as follows (verbatim from Figure
D-2):
a. **Threats to General Human Security: Natural**
and human disasters, crime, breakdown of essential
services, plundering of resources, mass migrations,
large numbers of illegal aliens, refugees, protests,
civil disobedience/unrest.
b. **Civil Threats to Constitutional Order: Violent**
protests, sporadic communal violence, mass civil disorder, uncontrolled organised crime, breakdown of
law and order.
c. **Sub-state Threats to Constitutional Order:**
Systematic low-key violence by non-state groupings
including terrorism, assassination, hostage taking, seizures, sabotage, piracy.
d. **General Civil Conflict:** Widespread communal
inter-group violence and civil disorder. (Examples:
Kenya 2007-2008, Jos, Nigeria 2010).
e. **Insurgency: Armed rebellion, revolt or insurrection**
to weaken or gain control of the state. (Examples:


-----

Uganda-LRA 1987, Tuareg Rebellion 2007-2009).
f. **Civil War: Armed intra-state conflict between**
civilian groups or between the state and a group
motivated by identity issues, a desire for secession
or for control of the state. (Examples: Liberia 19891996, Algeria 1991-2002).

35. Threats may involve South Africa, SADC and non-SADC
states, South African interests in such states, and non-African
states. The framework is depicted in Figure D-2.

36. As before, the framework is used to map defence scenarios considered plausible within the higher-level context, and to
identify the scenarios that should be included in the deliberation
of South Africa’s level of defence intent.

###### RISK ASSESSMENT

37. The selection of the contingencies to be addressed in the
defence ambition requires the prioritisation of plausible contingencies according to a consistent set of criteria. A risk model
developed for the purpose of assessing strategic niches in the
defence industry was adapted for this purpose. The risk associated with an event is typically defined as the probability of the
event, multiplied by some measure of the impact of the event.
In essence this describes the approach used in the risk model.

38. The probability of a contingency is related to the scenario

_Figure D-3: Risk Assessment: Illustration_


with which it is associated. So, for instance, it seems logical that
the probability of armed conflict between countries would be
higher in the pessimistic scenario mentioned earlier, than in the
optimistic scenario. However, a scenario is not a prediction and
even if it were, it would be impossible to predict the probability
of a future event with precision. The estimates of probability
used in the model are therefore not only first-order judgments
of absolute probability within the context of the particular strategic scenario, but should reflect a judgment of the likelihood of
occurrence of each contingency relative to the other contingencies.

39. The potential impact of each contingency is assessed using
the following criteria:
a. Impact on the South African economy.
b. Impact on the economy of the region.
c. Human impact in South Africa in terms of death and
displacement.
d. Human impact in the region in terms of death and
displacement.
e. Impact on South Africa’s territorial integrity.
f. Impact on South Africa’s international standing.
g. Impact on morale in South Africa.

40. A scale is used to measure potential impact in terms of
each criterion. This scale is also expressed as numerical scores
that enable the computation of average impact across criteria.
Risk is then expressed as the product of probability and impact.


-----

The assessments are plotted graphically to enable a visual comparison of the relative probability, impact and risk of various contingencies. Figure D-3 is an illustration of such a graphic.

41. According to the definition of risk as the product of probability and impact, contingencies having both a high probability
and a high impact are high-risk contingencies. These would occupy the upper-right sector of the graphic, as illustrated by Contingency 1 in Figure D-3. Contingency 3, on the other hand, has
a very high impact but such a low probability that it falls in the low
risk sector. For the purpose of the illustration, high-, mediumand low-risk sectors are indicated but this illustrates the general
principle. In practice the decision on exactly where the boundaries should lie, while still following the principle, is a matter of
judgment. The position of a contingency represents its absolute
risk. The size of the circle represents the risk of the contingency
relative to Contingencies 2 and 3. In combination these give
an indication of the absolute and relative priorities contingencies
should enjoy. Since hypothetical future events are being considered, this can obviously be nothing more than a judgment of the
potential order of magnitude of the impact of a type or category
of contingency.

42. The changes in the positions of the contingencies under
the various scenarios give a useful indication of possible developments and priorities. This information is used to define the
assessments in the defence intent framework. In any single scenario, higher risk contingencies would normally assume higher
priority. However, when multiple scenarios are considered,
contingencies that may constitute a low risk in most but a very
high risk in one, might justify a higher priority. Interactions between contingencies should also be considered since work invested in some contingencies could have the effect of reducing
the probability of occurrence of others. In yet other cases, the
decision might be taken to merely monitor risk indicators related
to a scenario or contingency, using a change in those indicators
as a trigger for measures to deal with or contain an emerging
situation.

43. However, it cannot be over-emphasised that the scenario
analysis and risk assessments are not assessments of or predictions regarding actual anticipated events. They are mental exercises that are intended to help participating staff think through the
spectrum of possible futures in a structured, logical manner, so
that they will better understand what the future might hold and
will therefore be better prepared to make recommendations regarding future defence requirements. It is, essentially, a way of
improving judgment.


##### ANALYSIS OF SCENARIOS


###### STRATEGIC SCENARIO

44. Despite the economic and military rise of the East, it maintains healthy relations with Western countries marked by a reduction in political tension in order to maintain good trade relations. The UN Security Council has provided Africa and South
America each with a de facto permanent seat, allowing the
interests of developing nations to be better represented. This
places reconstruction and development in Africa much higher
on the UN agenda and creates more urgency and commitment
in the UN, the World Bank and among EU donors and agencies
to become more closely involved in assisting poor and conflictstricken African countries.

45. Within the AU and regional economic communities
(RECs), African states unite more closely to protect and promote common continental and sub-regional political, economic
and security interests given the high demand for Africa’s natural
resources. The number and intensity of intra-state conflicts continue to decline as in the rest of the world. Donors also start
to invest more in demobilisation, disarmament and reintegration
(DDR) and security sector reform which were underfunded for
a long time.

46. Africa maintains its record economic growth rate with
booming prices in commodities such as oil, gas and coal, whichhas enabled Africa to make significant progress in its strive towards achieving the Millenium Development Goals (MDGs).
Reforms in many African countries towards building more mixed
economies in sectors such as agriculture and manufacturing, reduce reliance on income from such commodities. More scientific
ways of farming enable Africa to largely avoid food security crises,
despite water scarcity and droughts caused by climate change.
Africa’s overall economic growth reduces economic inequalities
within and between countries.

47. Most African countries have a growing middle class as
social mobility is improving. Economic growth is also allowing
African states to significantly improve their education and health
systems. Africa maintains its general trend towards civil and political freedom.

48. The exponential growth in cell phone use in Africa is en

-----

abling various civic groups in Africa to mobilise around common
interests for elections and to hold their governments more accountable, which results in improved governance and democratisation. Large-scale infrastructure projects are improving connectivity and trade between African countries and improve the
export of goods to other continents. It also enables a freer
movement of skilled and unskilled labour within and between
RECs.

49. In summary, the strategic scenario is characterised by a
stable international system, relatively rapid but uneven economic growth and political development and high levels of African cooperation with growing participation in global economic
and political affairs. There is relative peace and stability, with
sporadic but decreasing conflict in some countries. Solidarity,
constructive engagement, development and participation in and
through international institutions are the order of the day. There
has been significant improvement in human development and
progress toward African Renaissance ideals.

###### DEFENCE SCENARIO: INTER-STATE

50. In this strategic scenario the possibility of high levels of
armed conflict between states and involving African states, par
_Figure D-4: The Inter-State Defence Scenario: Optimistic Trajectory_


ticularly SADC states, is considered much reduced. Plausible
defence contingencies comprising the defence scenario are depicted in Figure D-4.

###### Threat Directed at South Africa

51. Apart from peacetime interaction and political or economic rivalry between states, any overt armed threat against
South Africa is considered implausible. The only plausible threat
is at the level of sub-national conflict but is highly unlikely and if
it were to manifest, would be very limited and localised. The
exception is a cyber threat that will be present in varying intensity in every scenario. Limited war against South Africa is not
considered plausible or probable in the context of the optimistic
strategic trajectory.

###### Threats to External Vital Interests

52. South Africa’s vital interests may include matters related
to food and water security, energy security, security of trade,
strategic lines of communication and communication hubs,
threats to South African territory abroad and threats to the life
or property of South Africans abroad. Direct state threats to vital
interests, although plausible, are unlikely in an optimistic trajec

-----

tory. If such threats were to manifest, they are likely to take the
form of sub-national threats such as seizures or occupations of
external assets or territory. On the other hand, conflict between
other states could indirectly threaten South African interests in
those countries.

###### Direct Threats against SADC and the Continent

53. Political and economic rivalry/competition in SADC and on
the continent will be a reality in any scenario, although in the
optimistic scenario there will be a greater tendency towards cooperative relations between states.

54. In the optimistic scenario conflict involving African states is
not expected to escalate beyond sporadic/limited overt armed
conflict. This may involve actions instigated or supported by external actors to secure access to resources. Limited war would
not be expected.

###### International Conflict

55. It is considered plausible that even on the optimistic trajectory international conflict to the level of limited war may occur
somewhere on the planet. Political dynamics and set foreign
policy goals will determine the level of South African participation, if any, in the resolution of such conflict.


###### Inter-State Risk Profile: Optimistic Trajectory

56. The risks associated with inter-state contingencies involving South Africa and SADC states are depicted in Figure D-5.
In the initial analysis that is described in this annexure, the risks
for the rest of Africa and beyond were not assessed. However,
while the probability of inter-state conflict elsewhere on the continent may be higher than in the SADC sphere, the impact on
South Africa will be lower. The risk for South Africa may therefore arguably be similar.

57. In the optimistic strategic scenario higher impact defence
contingencies have such low probabilities, and higher probability
contingencies such low impacts, that the risks associated with
both sets are low. Relatively speaking, however, the highest
risks are associated with the possibility of sub-national conflict
involving a SADC state or states (implying possible SANDF involvement in peace missions) or peaceful political and economic
interaction and rivalry (implying SANDF support to other departments and defence interaction with other states).

###### DEFENCE SCENARIO: INTRA-STATE

58. In the optimistic strategic scenario the intra-state threats
to Southern Africa could generally be expected to be limited
in scope and severity. In the wider African environment more


_Figure D-5: Risk Assessment for the Inter-State Defence Scenario: Optimistic Trajectory_


-----

severe threats are considered plausible, while at a global level
anything remains possible – despite conditions of general peace
and progress, there will still be individual countries that may implode. The intra-state defence scenario is depicted in Figure
D-6.

###### Threat to South Africa

59. In the optimistic strategic scenario the only intra-state
threats are general threats to human security. There is no overt
internal threat to the constitutional order.

###### Threat to SADC States and/or South African In- terests in Such States

60. Internal threats to the level of sub-state threats to the constitutional order are considered plausible within SADC. These
would generally be dealt with as a purely domestic matter but
may on occasion require multilateral countermeasures. Where
such threats constitute a threat to South Africa’s vital interests,
autonomous action may be required in exceptional circumstances.

_Figure D-6: The Intra-State Defence Scenario: Optimistic Trajectory_


###### Threat to Non-SADC States and/or South Afri- can Interests in Such States

61. Internal threats to the level of insurgencies are considered
plausible in Africa beyond SADC. Low levels of threat would
usually be dealt with as a domestic matter but where severe
threats to security arise, these would generally be dealt with in
a multilateral context as AU- or UN-mandated peace missions.
Where such threats constitute a threat to South Africa’s vital
interests, autonomous action may be required in exceptional
circumstances.

###### Internal Threats beyond Africa

62. The entire range of internal threats to the level of civil war
is possible. Low levels of threat would usually be dealt with as
a domestic matter but where severe threats to security arise,
these would generally be dealt with in a multilateral context by
international coalitions or as UN-mandated peace missions.

###### Intra-State Risk Profile: Optimistic Trajectory

63. In general, the risks associated with intra-state threats to
South Africa and SADC are low. In relative terms the most im

-----

portant threats are associated with lower-order contingencies.
The risk assessment is depicted in Figure D-7.

64. The most important threats to South Africa are expected
to be general threats to security such as crime, natural and manmade disasters, breakdowns of essential services, the plundering of resources, protests, civil disobedience/unrest, etc. Even
in the optimistic scenario protests could become violent, leading
to limited communal violence and civil disorder. The risks for
SADC are similar, although organised violence constituting a substate threat to the constitutional order may be possible in some
states.


##### THE MIDDLE-ROAD TRAJECTORY  ‘MAINTAINING THE STATUS QUO’


###### STRATEGIC SCENARIO

65. The international system is a multi-polar world with continuing diffusion of power. There is increasing pressure particularly from developing countries to reform the UN Security
Council, the G8, the IMF and the World Bank to reflect current
international dynamics and to better represent the interests of
the developing world. The US, the EU, Russia, China, India and
Japan continue to play major roles, but with other states and
other types of international actors occasionally rising to importance on various international issues.

66. Stable economic relations are considered more important
than military or political-ideological concerns, but competition for
access to natural resources and markets in developing regions,


_Figure D-7: Risk_
_Assessment for the_
_Intra-State Defence_
_Scenario: Optimistic_
_Trajectory_

including sub-Saharan Africa, is creating political tension between
emerging and developed economies. Prior to the international
economic recession, Africa experienced relatively high rates of
economic growth. African countries with valuable minerals and
significant oil and gas reserves recovered well after the recession.
Low-income African countries without significant infrastructure
and industrial capacity, were less affected by the recession. On
average, most African countries experience higher and steady
economic growth rates, but on an insufficient scale to meet the
demand for development on the continent. Inadequate economic growth causes slow progress with Africa’s general health
status and human development compared to the rest of the developing world. There is uneven development in and between
Africa’s RECs. Africa therefore made limited progress in terms of
sustainable human development and achieving the MDGs. Africa’s high level of professional skills loss inhibits its potential for
job creation, innovation and direct global integration.

67. Africa continues its general trend towards democratisation
and respect for human rights, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa.
Drawn-out intrastate conflicts in countries such as the DRC,
Somalia, Uganda and Nigeria are difficult to stop and remain a
problem in terms of peace and security on the continent. Yet
the number of inter- and intra-state conflicts in Africa is declining together with the number of deaths in armed conflict. In
this sense Africa has made progress towards a more stable and
peaceful continent, but is largely dependent on UN/multinational
peace missions in the Great Lakes as well as Sudan/Darfur and
its neighbouring states, to prevent these regional conflicts from
escalating.


-----

68. The number of refugees in Africa’s conflict hot-spots is
increasing at an alarming rate – creating tension between neighbouring countries about the burden that refugee camps place
on their economies and security forces. Food security problems
due to climate change and old farming methods are worsened
by the large numbers of refugees and internally displaced people, as many people are unable to grow crops on a sufficient
scale and therefore become dependent on international food
aid.

69. Except for oil-producing countries such as Algeria, Angola
and Nigeria, most African states invest very little in their armed
forces, which creates a general decline in military capabilities and
the ability of states to control their own territory. South Africa is
a case in point, with a stagnant defence budget which is declining
in real terms, high inflows of illegal immigrants and a low level
of education among military professionals, which is eroding the
SANDF’s image, credibility and standing in Africa. African militaries have become dependent on strong powers to take part in
African peace missions, particularly for air transport and logistics.

70. While the AU has ratified many policies and resolutions,
it struggles to provide sufficient early-warning and political intervention to prevent conflicts, making the AU reactive instead of

_Figure D-8: The Inter-State Defence Scenario: Current Trajectory_


pro-active. Due to a lack of resources and capacity, the AU also
struggles to partner with foreign donors and development agencies for reconstruction and development on the continent. The
lack of regional cooperation in the AU has resulted in the African
Standby Force not reaching its set milestones and being largely
unprepared for large-scale peace enforcement.

71. In summary, the international system is relatively stable.
There is moderate to rapid but unstable economic growth in
some African countries, stagnation or regression in others. Regional development is uneven. Generally there is progress toward peace, stability and democracy but some countries and
regions are still afflicted by persistent conflict. Regional cooperation in support of AU ideals is limited. Human development
continues to lag behind the rest of the developing world, impeding global integration.

###### DEFENCE SCENARIO: INTER-STATE

72. In this strategic scenario higher levels of inter-state conflict
are possible than in the optimistic scenario but limited war involving South Africa or SADC is considered implausible due to
the absence of plausible motivations and relatively limited military capabilities. The defence scenario is depicted in Figure D-8.


-----

###### Threats to South Africa

73. The highest threat level against South Africa considered
plausible under the current trajectory is overt armed conflict involving a contiguous state or an external source. This is purely
because the capability to launch a strike or raid against South
Africa exists, not because there is any real expectation of such
an eventuality. On the contrary, the probability is considered to
be very small. However, it is possible that unforeseen events
could drive the security situation in a direction where an armed
incident could arise. Armed conflict involving a remote African
source is not considered plausible due to a lack of any credible
motivation, the lack of capability to project and sustain forces
over the distances involved, the need for complicity of a contiguous state and the absence of a historical precedent for aggressive force projection by any other than a major power against a
non-contiguous state. A substantial geo-strategic shift would be
required to render such an eventuality plausible.

###### Threats to South Africa’s Interests

74. As in the optimistic scenario, threats to South Africa’s interests, although plausible, are unlikely. If such threats were to
manifest, they are likely to take the form of sub-national threats
such as seizures or occupations of external assets or territory.
On the other hand, conflict between other states could indirectly
threaten South African interests in those countries.

###### Threats to SADC Countries

75. Threats to the level of overt armed conflict involving a


SADC state or states are considered plausible on the current trajectory. This is an expression of current military capabilities and
the general security situation within the strategic scenario, which
makes it extremely unlikely that international tensions could escalate to a level where a limited war could occur.

###### Threats to Non-SADC Countries

76. On the current strategic trajectory it is considered plausible that tensions over latent issues that led to limited war between states in the past could escalate, precipitating new bouts
of armed conflict. Limited war involving African states beyond
SADC is therefore included in the defence scenario.

###### Threats to Non-African Countries

77. Limited war between states outside Africa is considered
plausible. However, general or total war between states – essentially wars of conquest, which imply a dramatic change in the
international system – is excluded.

###### Inter-State Risk Profile: Current Trajectory

78. The risks associated with the above defence scenario are
illustrated in Figure D-9. As indicated by the arrows in Figure
D-9, the probability of sub-national and overt armed conflict
involving a SADC state or states has increased significantly relative to the optimistic strategic scenario, as has the probability of
sub-national conflict involving South Africa. All the contingencies except overt armed conflict involving a SADC state or states
remain low in absolute terms. Overt armed conflict (SADC)

-----

has, however, edged into the medium risk sector. This implies
the possibility of SANDF involvement in peace missions in the
SADC region.


##### DEFENCE SCENARIO: INTRA-STATE


###### Threat to South Africa

79. As indicated in Figure D-10, the intra-state threats to
South Africa in the current strategic scenario include general
threats to human security and civil threats to the constitutional
order. The latter could, for example, include violent protests,
sporadic communal violence and civil disorder resulting from
unsatisfied expectations.

###### Threat to SADC States and/or South African In- terests in such States

80. On the current trajectory all levels of intra-state conflict,
to the level of insurgency and civil war, are considered possible
within the wider SADC. This implies the possibility of SANDF
involvement in multilateral peace missions or autonomous action to protect vital interests threatened by such conflict.

_Figure D-10: The Intra-State Defence Scenario: Current Trajectory_


###### Threat to Non-SADC States and/or South Afri- can Interests in such States

81. As before, all levels of intra-state conflict are possible within an African context.

###### Internal Threats beyond Africa

82. The entire range of internal threats to the level of civil war
is possible.

###### Risk Profile: Optimistic Trajectory

83. In general, the risks associated with intra-state threats to
South Africa are low but any level of threat could arise beyond
South Africa’s borders, increasing in severity beyond contiguous
states. The risk assessment is depicted in Figure D-11.

84. As indicated by the arrows, the probability of a number of
contingencies is considered significantly higher than under the
optimistic strategic scenario, increasing the risk associated with
those contingencies accordingly. While most are relatively low
impact contingencies, thus remaining in the low-risk sector de

-----

spite the higher probabilities and relative risks, the higher-impact
contingency – general civil conflict in a SADC state or states – has
moved into the medium-risk sector. This, as indicated earlier,
implies possible SANDF involvement in peace missions in SADC
and/or autonomous action where vital interests are threatened
by such conflict.


##### PESSIMISTIC TRAJECTORY  ‘A PATH OF REGRESSION’


###### STRATEGIC SCENARIO

85. The international system is a turbulent and competitive
multi-polar system with rising economic and military tension between strong powers. Cooperation within and between RECs is
declining internationally including Africa, due to competition between states for access to dwindling energy sources and minerals
to maintain their economic growth. The UN, AU and SADC
have become largely ineffective in international affairs as member
states fend for themselves. There is a strong shift to mercantilism
as countries try to protect their industries against cheap imports
by means of tariff barriers and other trade restrictions particularly
in the North.

86. As strong powers try to compete for or maintain exploitation rights for fossil fuels and minerals in African countries, they increasingly turn a blind eye to unconstitutional changes of political
power, human rights violations and economic mismanagement
of African governments. Undeclared small arms and conventional weapons transfers to African governments often form part
of contracts to obtain rights to exploit natural resources which
exacerbates the proliferation of small arms on the continent.


_Figure D-11: Risk Assess-_
_ment for the Intra-State Defence_
_Scenario: Current Trajectory_

87. A lack of solidarity, cooperative intent and security cooperation in Africa has aggravated the situation of inter- and intrastate conflicts on the continent. Border disputes over oil-rich areas have escalated into incidents of small-scale battles between
neighbouring states.

88. As African countries try to cope with rapidly increasing
populations and youth bulge, urbanisation and mega-cities, they
spend less on maintaining and expanding their commercial and
industrial infrastructure – resulting in the deterioration of much
of Africa’s economic infrastructure. Most African states cannot
keep up with the demand for essential services and policing in
mega-cities. Organised crime syndicates and some international
terrorist groups exploit this situation and expand their activities
– becoming a threat to state security. There are also more incidents of inter-communal fighting between religious and ethnic
groups competing for political power.

89. The military capabilities of armed forces in most African
countries have deteriorated extensively and many have been
reduced to militias that mainly protect the ruling elite and their
economic interests. As a result, military interventions aimed at
protecting foreign economic interests have increased. Incidents
of piracy around the Horn of Africa and the Gulf of Guinea are
increasing due to a lack of law and order on land – raising concerns about the impact on international trade.

90. Strong powers are making increasing use of private military
and security companies (PMSCs) to protect their economic interests in Africa, without cooperating with international protocols
for regulating the PMSC industry. Subsequently security sector
reform is receiving less attention in Africa.


-----

91. African countries are unable to feed their growing populations with internal produce due to climate change and continued subsistence farming. Africa therefore faces serious food and
water security challenges and many countries are dependent
on international food aid. The deterioration of security in many
African countries results in the withdrawal of NGOs and UN
agencies from the continent – leaving few organisations behind
who are able to provide aid in both urban and remote rural
areas.

92. In summary, the international system is turbulent with
intense competition for global dominance and increasing economic and political instability at global and continental levels.
There is widespread conflict within and sometimes between African states due to demographic pressures and competition for
resources. Economic resources are severely strained. Solidarity, cooperative intent and collective security mechanisms have
been eroded and have in some cases broken down. There
is increasing military intervention by external powers to secure
their interests, particularly access to resources.

###### DEFENCE SCENARIO: INTER-STATE

93. In the turbulent international environment sketched in the
pessimistic strategic scenario, conflict to the level of limited war
involving a SADC state or states, other African states and external powers is possible, as depicted in Figure D-12.


###### Threat Directed at South Africa

94. Despite the turbulent environment, a crisis escalating to a
limited war with another state would require the confluence of
multiple causative factors. While this is plausible, the probability
is considered low. If an armed threat were to develop, it is most
likely to involve a contiguous state. An external attack on South
Africa is plausible if, for instance, South Africa harboured factions that posed a threat to the vital interests of a major power
or directly threatened such interests. This is highly unlikely as
long as South Africa remains a pivotal state in the region and a
responsible international actor. As before, the threat level for
this has been kept at the level of overt armed conflict simply
because the capability exists.

###### Threats to South Africa’s Interests

95. Threats to South Africa’s interests could arise within a
conflict between South Africa and another state, or as a consequence of conflict involving other states in the region. This
could manifest in any level of conflict, up to and including limited
war.

###### Threats to SADC, Non-SADC and Non-African Countries

96. Threats to the level of limited war are considered plau

_Trajectory_


-----

sible within the pessimistic trajectory. This could include substantial external support to African belligerents or direct external
intervention in Africa.

###### Risk Profile: Pessimistic Trajectory

97. In the pessimistic scenario the probability of conflict is significantly higher than on the optimistic or current trajectories, as


_Figure D-13: Risk Assessment_
_for the Inter-State Defence Sce-_
_nario: Pessimistic Trajectory_

indicated by the arrows in Figure D-13. The absolute risks are
accordingly greater.

98. The relatively low impact of political/economic rivalry and
sub-national conflict results in low risks despite moderate to high
probabilities. Limited war and overt armed conflict involving
South Africa or a SADC state or states, however, are higherimpact contingencies that move into the medium-risk sector as a

_Figure D-14:_
_The Intra-State_
_Defence Scenario:_
_Pessimistic Trajec-_
_tory_


-----

result of increased probabilities within the pessimistic scenario.
These are also the contingencies carrying the highest relative
risks.

###### THE DEFENCE SCENARIO: INTRA-STATE

 Threat to South Africa

99. As indicated in Figure D-14, the intra-state threats to
South Africa in the pessimistic strategic scenario include anything
up to an insurgency. This may be limited to some areas of the
country and may not enjoy wide domestic support, but would
require a significant contribution by defence to maintain law and
order in the affected areas.

###### Threat to SADC States and/or South African In- terests in such States

100. On the pessimistic trajectory all levels of intra-state conflict, to the level of civil war, are considered possible within the
wider SADC. This implies the possibility of SANDF involvement in multilateral peace missions or autonomous action to
protect vital interests threatened by such conflict.

###### Threat to Non-SADC States and/or South Afri- can Interests in such States

101. As before, all levels of intra-state conflict are possible within an African context.


###### Internal Threats beyond Africa

102. The entire range of internal threats to the level of civil war
is possible.

###### Risk Profile: Pessimistic Trajectory

103. In general, the risks associated with intra-state threats to
South Africa may include localised, low-level insurgency but any
level of threat could arise beyond South Africa’s borders, increasing in severity beyond contiguous states. The risk assessment is depicted in Figure D-15.


104. The preceding analysis sketched three scenarios at the
strategic level. These were elaborated into collections of generic contingencies representing corresponding defence scenarios. The associated risk analyses were judgments regarding the
probability and impact of those contingencies in the context of
the strategic scenarios. All of this is a mental exercise designed
to stimulate and structure thoughts about possible futures.
Those futures are hypothetical but are considered plausible in
the light of current environmental analyses and intelligence appreciations. They do not include extreme events that would
dramatically alter the defence landscape, such as a melt-down of
the global political and/or economic system, catastrophic longterm environmental disruption or widespread and hostile major
power involvement in Africa.

_tory_


##### CONSOLIDATION OF ANALYSIS ACROSS ALL THREE SCENARIOS


-----

105. There can be no guarantee that the future will play out
within the constraints sketched above. However, it is impossible
to plan in the absence of objectives and constraints – mathematically, optimisation of an objective function is only possible within
given constraints. If either changes, the solution will change.
So, too, with defence planning, where expectations of the future
(including the funding to be allocated to defence) are vital constraints. If those expectations change significantly, re-planning is
required.

106. The analysis as it stands thus implies certain planning assumptions and/or guidelines:
a. Force planning within a constrained future.
b. The management of risks outside that future by other means.
c. Re-planning if events indicating a departure from that
constrained future should develop.
d. The use of the force-in-being to deal with extreme
events until the Defence Review can be implemented.

107. However, defence capabilities must also support and enable the regional, continental and global role South Africa desires and is expected to play, ie defence must be configured and

_Figure D-16: The Inter-State Defence Scenario: Consolidated_


equipped to reflect and give expression to South Africa’s international status and its national security and foreign policies. Balance
must be achieved between national ambitions, defence capabilities and defence funding.

108. As a starting point, planning assumptions/guidelines must
be set within the constrained future of the scenarios. Since
neither the optimistic nor the current trajectories pose any real
challenges for defence, the following general guidelines are proposed:
a. Contingencies considered plausible within the pessimistic trajectory will be set as baseline.
b. Priorities will be set as follows:
i. High- or medium-risk contingencies affecting
South Africa or its vital interests.
ii. High- or medium-risk contingencies affecting
SADC and similar contingencies affecting the
rest of Africa.
iii. Low-risk, high-impact contingencies.
iv. Peacetime defence interaction and support to
government departments.
v. Other contingencies.
c. The SANDF force-in-being should be capable of
dealing with high- or medium-risk contingencies.


-----

d. Given sufficient warning and resources, the SANDF
should be capable of expanding or adjusting to meet
low-risk, high-impact contingencies.  Early warning
systems will be in place and resources will be allocated as and when required.
e. South African involvement in contingencies other
than threats to South Africa or its interests will be
discretionary within the context of peace missions
or other multinational actions.
f. Force planning will make provision for concurrent
activities to a specified level. Where that level is exceeded, higher risk contingencies will take priority.
g. Cyber security will be a ubiquitous requirement.

109. In addition to these general guidelines, specific guidelines
will apply in determining the capability requirements for the inter- and intra-state dimensions.

###### CONSOLIDATED INTER-STATE DIMENSION

110. The consolidated inter-state scenario is presented in Figure D-16.

111. Specific guidelines applying to the inter-state dimension
are.
a. As the leading state in SADC and in Africa, South
Africa must be able to match the military capabilities
of its peers. In terms of defensive capability, despite
the absence of any military threat to South Africa
from the region, this means that the SANDF must
as a force-in-being at least be able to defend against
a threat to the level of overt armed conflict from
a neighbouring state. This capability should be the
focus of a balanced, sustainable military force, able
to meet other commitments.
b. The SANDF force-in-being should provide the basis
for expansion to a level where the SANDF will be
able to defend against a threat of limited war from a
contiguous state.
c. No specific provision will be made for overt threats
from non-contiguous African sources:
i. There are no plausible causative factors or
strategic motivations evident.
ii. Globally there is no historical precedent for
such action.


iii. The capability to project force over the distances involved is very limited.
iv. It implies complicity of a contiguous state or a
violation of the integrity of such a state. In the
first case it will be treated as a threat from a
contiguous state; in the second, as a threat to
that state, which will be dealt with multilaterally.
d. A threat to South Africa from external sources beyond Africa constitutes an extreme event that implies major power involvement. Due to the asymmetry this entails, the extreme unlikelihood of such
an event and the limited resources available to the
SANDF, the SANDF will not specifically make provision for such a threat. The risk will be managed
primarily by other means.
e. The SANDF should be able to contribute to multinational peace missions to the level of peace enforcement in the context of inter-state limited war
involving other African states. However, such involvement and the scale thereof are discretionary
and will be determined by the specific situation.
Criteria for such involvement and a predetermined
maximum level of involvement are to be set.
f. Threats to South Africa’s interests will preferentially
be dealt with at a multilateral level. However, the
SANDF should have the capability for limited autonomous operations in defence of vital interests.
Those interests and the maximum level of autonomous action are to be defined.
g. SANDF deployments beyond Africa will be exceptional, of limited scale and duration, and subject to
other priorities. In general, threats to security closer
to South Africa will enjoy priority.
h. Contingencies at the level of general or total war
are excluded from the planning baseline due to the
low probability and resource implications thereof.
The development of such a scenario implies a major change in the international order, requiring replanning of defence capabilities.
i. Participation in military diplomacy, assistance and
other cooperative interaction will be a standing
commitment in support of South Africa’s regional,
continental and global role.


-----

###### CONSOLIDATED INTRA-STATE DIMENSION

112. The consolidated intra-state scenario is presented in Figure
D-17. As before, the focus of the force-in-being is on mediumto high-risk contingencies, although in its internal role even some
low-risk contingencies may involve SANDF support to the SAPS
and other departments.

113. Specific guidelines applying to this dimension are:
a. The SANDF force-in-being should have the capability to fulfil the following short-term requirements:
i. Assistance to the SAPS and civil authorities in
dealing with general threats to security.
ii. Assistance to the SAPS and civil authorities in
countering low-level threats to security including civil threats to the constitutional order and
sub-state threats such as terrorism and piracy.
iii. The protection of South Africa’s external interests against direct or indirect threats. Threats
to South Africa’s interests will preferentially be
dealt with at a multilateral level. However, the

_Figure D-17: The Intra-State Defence Scenario: Consolidated_


SANDF should have the capability for limited
autonomous operations in defence of vital
interests. Those interests and the maximum
level of autonomous action are to be defined
(including maritime interests!).
iv. Participation in multinational regional/continental peace missions occurring in the context of
general civil conflict in a SADC state or elsewhere in Africa. Such participation shall be discretionary to a predetermined maximum scale
and shall be subject to other priorities.
b. In the longer term the SANDF shall have the ability
to scale up to the following requirements:
i. Assistance to the SAPS and civil authorities in
countering a significant internal threat, including low-level insurgency.
ii. Participation in multinational regional/continental peace missions to the level of peace
enforcement in a civil war situation. Such participation shall be discretionary to a predetermined maximum scale and shall be subject to
other priorities.
