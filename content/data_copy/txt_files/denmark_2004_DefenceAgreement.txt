# The Danish Defence Agreement 2005 - 2009


-----

### The Liberals, the Conservatives, the Social Democrats, the Danish People Party, the Social Liberals and the Christian Democrats have entered into the following agreement for the Danish Defence.
 Introduction

1. The Danish Defence is an important factor in working towards the realisation of the foremost goals of the Danish foreignand security policy, namely democracy, freedom and human rights.

The goals of the Danish Defence are the following: 1) to counter direct and indirect threats to the security of Denmark and
allied countries, 2) to maintain Danish sovereignty and the protection of Danish citizens, 3) to work towards international
peace and security in accordance with the principles of the UN Charter, specifically through conflict prevention,
peacekeeping, peacemaking, and humanitarian operations.

Changes in the international security environment require the Danish Defence to strengthen its capacities in two central
areas: 1) Internationally deployable military capacities and 2) the ability to counter terror acts and their consequences.

The United Nations is the framework of the efforts to create international order. In recent years the UN has developed a more
effective capacity to engage in peace supporting operations and this development should be supported. At the same time the
ability of the UN, as well as the ability of regional organisations, to prevent and resolve conflicts, among other places in Africa,
should be strengthened.

The political parties behind the Defence Agreement agree that NATO is the central forum for joint security – and defence
cooperation. The collective defence remains strongly anchored within NATO. NATO is the framework of the transatlantic
partnership and a guarantor of European security. Denmark will continue to contribute to NATO, including the NATO
Response Force.

The Danish Defence will contribute with ready, well-equipped and effective forces for international operations, as well as a
strengthened coordination between the military and the civilian humanitarian effort in the area of operations.

Furthermore, in the case of the Danish opt-out with regard to the EU defence policy possibly being removed in the future,
Denmark will be able to participate in the EU efforts within peacemaking, peacekeeping, conflict prevention, humanitarian
operations and the strengthening of international security in accordance with the principles of the UN Charter.

The political parties agree that the structure and capacity of the Danish Defence during 2005-2009 should be organised in a
way that will ensure that Denmark, in the event of a possible removal of the opt-out, will be immediately able to contribute to
future European defence initiatives, including combating terrorism, preventing the spread of weapons of mass destruction
and peace supporting operations with force contributions from both the EU and NATO.

The current security environment, including the enlargement of NATO and the EU, is of such a nature that the conventional
military threat to the Danish territory has ceased for the foreseeable future. There is no longer a need for the conventional
territorial defence of the Cold War.

The terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 and subsequent terrorist attacks have demonstrated that the security challenges
and risks confronting Denmark and other nations have significantly changed. New asymmetric and unpredictable threats
such as international terrorism and the spreading of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery have entered
the scene.

The threats do not necessarily have to originate from Denmark’s geographical proximity, but may nevertheless constitute a
risk to Denmark, our allies and our common values, even if they manifest themselves abroad. Accordingly, the priority of
Danish security policy should be aimed at possessing the capability to counter the threats where they emerge, regardless of
whether this is within or beyond Denmark’s borders. Therefore, Danish Defence – together with other national components –
should focus on strengthening the total defence of Denmark and its population and on ensuring Denmark’s capability to
participate in international operations.


-----

The unpredictable aspect of the threats means that organising Danish Defence to counter a well-defined threat scenario is
no longer possible. Therefore the Danish Defence should be organised according to a capacity-based approach whereby a
wide range of capacities can be made available in situations in which Danish security or Danish interests are threatened or
affected, directly or indirectly, or where Danish responsibilities within the international community make this necessary. The
unpredictable nature of the threats demands a higher priority on military readiness and the capability to deploy military
capacities wherever they are needed, regardless of whether this involves humanitarian efforts, peacekeeping operations,
emergency situations in or outside Denmark, or participation in regular military operations.

### Total Defence

In general, total defence encompasses the utilisation of all resources in order to maintain an organised, functional society
and to protect the population and the national assets.

The threats to be countered by total defence cut across national borders and the domestic administrative domains of various
public authorities. As a result, threat containment demands joint solutions and close coordination among the accountable
international and national authorities.

One of the benefits for Danish society, from Danish Defence’s previous conscript training for the mobilisation-based combat
force, is that many persons were trained as conscripts in several disciplines that have now become increasingly relevant.
This applies to fields such as surveillance, first aid, emergency response and defensive measures to counter atomic,
biological and chemical weapons, etc. In the current situation, other parts of the conventional conscript training for territorial
defence has lost much of its relevance, but personnel are still needed to enable Danish Defence to contribute to total
defence. The compulsory military service, as stipulated in Article 81 of the Danish Constitution, should therefore be adjusted
accordingly.

In other regards, total defence is to be strengthened to the greatest possible extent by integration of national emergency
response effort and Danish Defence, in a structure that ensures synergy and simplification. Comparably, the Home Guard is
to be integrated into the operational and support structures of Danish Defence – without sacrificing its identity.

In addition, total defence is to be bolstered by establishing a total defence force comprising some 12,000 soldiers who have
completed a relevant 700-hour training programme over a four-month period. Within the first three years following completion
of the initial joint military training programme, this force shall be at the disposal of Danish Defence for performing total
defence tasks for the Danish community, provided that the capabilities of the standing forces of Danish Defence, the national
emergency management effort and the Home Guard are insufficient. Total defence force thereby ensures that Denmark has
sufficient available capacity to contain threats against the country and to handle large-scale catastrophes.

The needs of the Danish Defence are directly proportionate with the numbers of young people that are called upon to do
military service. All young men are required to attend “The Day of the Danish Defence” and all young women are invited to
attend it. On this day the Danish Defence introduces itself, presents career opportunities and distributes relevant information.
On the basis of this day of presentation and orientation of the Danish Defence the participants then inform the Defence
whether they would like to volunteer to do conscription or whether they are interested in another form of employment with the
Danish Defence. Subsequently the Defence draws up a contract for voluntary army training and also decides the number of
conscripts needed. Finally the suitability of individuals - conscripts as well as volunteers – for army services is evaluated.

Payment as well as other benefits for conscripts will be raised compared to the present pay during the first four months of
conscription.

Compulsory military service, including questions on numbers, duration and content, will be evaluated at the end of 2006.

### International Missions

The armed forces are to be reorganised and developed. Together with Denmark’s allies, Danish Defence must be able to
participate effectively in high intensity operations under often difficult and unstable conditions; accordingly, the means must
be obtained for stabilising actual areas of conflict and for rapidly deploying the forces in such areas. By so doing, Danish


-----

Defence can and should have a much greater capability than before to participate in peace-support operations, e.g., conflict
prevention, peacekeeping, peace-making, humanitarian and other similar missions.

The military effort must be planned in coordination with other Danish endeavours to obtain maximum effect of the overall
effort and fortify Denmark’s capacity to shoulder responsibility. The relevant organisations should be gathered as early as
possible to prepare the deployment of Danish military contingents, which would enable the definition of any relevant civilian
stabilisation efforts in the sphere of military operations from the outset. A focused effort and mutual exploitation of military
and civilian experience in this context would make it possible to get better results and thus – other things being equal – also
reduce the need for a military presence.

In the joint opinion of the parties, the recent and foreseeable developments of security policy make it possible to disband the
mobilisation defence in order to strengthen the capability of Danish Defence both to contribute to total defence, including the
capability to contain terrorist actions and impact, and to deploy well-trained, well-equipped units in international missions. It
must be possible to deploy Denmark’s armed forces both at home and abroad, whereby the defence of Denmark, in cooperation with Denmark’s allies, will obviously be the overriding task if the need arises.

### Other Issues

Danish Defence is to be reorganised by streamlining and trimming the staff and support structure for the benefit of the
operational capacities. Centralising the administration of personnel, material and establishments, etc., will reduce
administration for the Defence Command, the Royal Administration of Navigation and Hydrography, the Home Guard
Command, the Defence Construction Service, the operational commands and subordinate authorities, including regiments,
air bases, naval bases, schools, etc. The modifications will shift the current balance between the staff and support structure
and the operational commands in favour of operational capacities.

The parties of the accord note that steps have been taken to outsource Danish Defence’s ITC operations. The parties agree
that the institutions and authorities of the Ministry of Defence must continue to be managed as efficiently as possible. A result
of the Ministry’s efficiency engineering strategy is that all operating tasks will be reviewed to assess their outsourcing
suitability. As a result, focus will be brought to bear on the unexploited outsourcing potential and thereby exploit the market
competition to increase the efficiency and quality in the performance of operating assignments.

**In summary:**

-  Danish Defence will be reorganised to provide operational capacities and to release resources that enable Danish
Defence to mobilise and deploy forces promptly and flexibly in international operations and to maintain deployed
capacities that are the equivalent of some 2,000 personnel (1500 from the Army and 500 from the Navy and Air Force).

-  The current mobilisation defence and affiliated structure are to be disbanded. The remaining staff and support structures
are to be streamlined and trimmed to meet the precise needs for supporting the operational units, including total defence
and other domestic task performance.

-  The tasks of the national emergency management effort, the Home Guard and the Ministry of Defence are to be gathered
under the sphere of the Minister of Defence.

-  The present compulsory military service scheme under the Ministry of Defence is to be reorganised and targeted on total
defence. At the same time, this compulsory military service scheme will form the basis of military recruitment of anyone
who wishes to contribute to embedding Danish Defence in the Danish community.

-  The total number of operational units is to be reduced in return for a focused and qualitative reinforcement of the
remaining units.

-  Several military barracks and establishments are to be closed.

-  Financial resources will be released for deploying Danish military contingents in international operations.


-----

### Army

2. The Army’s capacity for rapid deployment of forces to prevent crises from occurring or developing further will be
additionally strengthened, at the same time as maintaining forces abroad for a longer period of time and to a greater extent
than before. Accordingly, the Army will be grouped in two brigades under the framework of the Danish Division. The Danish
Division staff and divisional troops, as well as one of the brigades, will primarily consist of professional soldiers, while the
other brigade will primarily comprise soldiers on a response-force contract. The brigades will be organised to enable the
flexible deployment of a relevant military contingent according to the tasks and terms of the actual operations. It is presumed
that the deployment and logistics are planned and continuously tested in conjunction with exercises, participation in NATO’s
Response Force, etc., so as to include the Navy and Air Force in this process in relation to sea and air transporting, enabling
military forces to be deployed on short notice.

The Danish Division, and affiliated brigades and divisional troops, are to be affiliated with the Allied Command Europe Rapid
Reaction Corps headquartered in Rheindahlen, Germany, and it will also be possible to affiliate the units with the
Multinational Corps North East, headquartered in Poland. Furthermore, Denmark will continue to participate in the
Multinational Standby Forces High Readiness Brigade for UN operations (SHIRBRIG) with a headquarters company, a
reconnaissance unit, a military police unit and staff personnel. The forces designated to SHIRBRIG will be obtained from the
Army’s two brigades.

The accord parties agree that Denmark must work for a development of SHIRBRIG, so that the multinational brigade –
besides peacekeeping operations on the basis of chapter VI of the UN Charter – can be deployed with more robust units in
peacemaking operations on the basis of chapter VII of the UN Charter.

The compulsory military service is to be reorganised so the training programme enables the conscripts to perform national
tasks in a total defence context. The training programme is aimed at individual military training that enables the soldier to
perform tasks in uncertain environments and at training that enables the soldier to function in small units, under leadership,
and perform tasks in a total defence context and which includes training in total-defence capabilities (e.g., fire fighting,
emergency response, maintaining law and order, etc.). Thus, the training programme is primarily aimed at total defence effort
within Denmark, whereas the training of soldiers for actual combat units requires a considerably longer training programme
in the form of a nine-month long training of reaction forces which is available to anyone who might be interested in this, with
a view to permanent employment in the armed forces or deployment in international operations.

Additionally conscripts will continue to be used for tasks related to the obligations of Danish Defence towards the Royal
Family, including the Life Guard and Calvary Squadron. The readiness obligation of these conscripts, who are called up for 8
and 12 months respectively, ceases after their tour of duty.

3. Based on the above, the Army will be reorganised as followed:

-  Two brigades, Sjællandske Kampgruppe (Sealand Task Force), Jysk Kampgruppe (Jutland Task Force), the task force
under the Danish Division, the Army Operational Command’s reconnaissance battalion, as well as the combat battalions
– five in all – of the territorial defence will be disbanded. In addition, a number of divisional troops will be disbanded,
including Squadron 724 (an anti-tank helicopter company) that is part of the Air Force’s present organisation). The
helicopters will subsequently be used for the for the forming of a helicopter observation and light transport detachment.

-  The Danish Division and staff, one communication unit, and one communication centre based in Haderslev and divisional
troops in the form of one standing telegraph battalion, and one electronic reconnaissance company in Fredericia, one
cadre-manned military police company in Aalborg, one standing engineers battalion in Skive, one standing artillery unit
consisting of staff, target reconnaissance battery and unit for managing air support in Oksbøl, a UAV battery (unmanned
air vehicles for reconnaissance) and air-defence missile unit in Varde. In addition to this a company for civilian, military
cooperation (CIMIC), to be located in Vordingborg. The accord parties will decide on how the CIMIC-capacity could be
strengthened based on the evaluation of lessons learned within the defence agreement period.

-  1. brigade consisting primarily of professional personnel is to be established with a staff and staff company in Haderslev,
one standing armoured battalion in Holstebro, one standing mechanized infantry battalion in Høvelte, one standing
reconnaissance battalion in Slagelse, one standing light reconnaissance squadron on Bornholm, one standing logistics


-----

battalion and one standing military police company in Aalborg, one standing armoured engineers company in Skive and
one partly standing artillery unit in Varde. The brigade is designated to NATO at high readiness.

-  2. brigade primarily comprising personnel on response-force contracts is to be established with staff and staff company,
one cadre-manned mechanized infantry battalion in Slagelse, one cadre-manned mechanized infantry battalion in
Høvelte, one cadre-manned mechanized infantry battalion in Holstebro, one cadre-manned artillery unit in Varde, one
cadre-manned armoured engineers company in Skive, one cadre-manned logistics battalion and one cadre-manned
military police company in Aalborg, as well as one standing, light reconnaissance squadron on Bornholm. The brigade is
designated to NATO at lower readiness.

-  The Danish Operational Logistics Group is to be established primarily based on permanent personnel in Vordingborg.

-  The Jæger Corps (special forces) shall be increased to approximately 135 specially trained soldiers.

-  Basic training is to be established in Aalborg, Skive, Holstebro, Fredericia, Varde, Slagelse, Høvelte and Vordingborg.

-  The Army’s school structure is to be adapted to the actual need. The Army's basic sergeant training programmes will be
gathered in Sønderborg.

-  The three military bands within the Army’s organisation are maintained.

-  Sjælsmark Barracks will be sold, whereas the training grounds in Melby will be closed, and an attempt will be made to
exchange the army range in Hevring, which will be demobilised. A garrison support unit will be established at other
establishments.

The Defence Budget is based on a calculated figure equivalent of some 2,150 full-time conscripts for the Army per year,
corresponding to the actual calling in of approximately 6,000 conscripts each year. The total number of permanent personnel
amounts to approximately 9,150 full-time equivalents, and the number of response force contracts amount to roughly 4,070,
for which 27,800 sustainment training days have been earmarked.

In the placement of the Army’s units and authorities, priority has been given to a balanced number of units in relation to
regional considerations, an expedient utilisation of barracks, including structural condition and environmental factors, as well
as educational aspects, including exercise grounds, whereby the subsequent consolidation of the various modifications may
bring about a need for additional changes.

The following Army equipment is to be procured:

-  Staff exercise simulation system (tactical simulation system for Army command training).

-  Command and control systems (C3I) (communication and command systems).

-  Reconnaissance vehicles

-  Infantry combat vehicles, whereby a number of M113 armoured personnel carriers and 180 (Leopard 1) tanks are to be
phased out.

-  Armoured wheeled vehicles.

-  Preliminary acquisition of a modern fire-support system.

-  Rescue vehicles

-  Engineering equipment.


-----

-  Logistics (part I and II).

-  Climatic equipment.

-  Update of the Field Hospital.

-  Tactical vehicles, as well as special equipment for the Army Special Operations Forces.

-  ABC equipment for joint military utilisation.

### Navy

4. The specialised capacities of the Navy in carrying out littoral operations are to be maintained and further developed, while
simultaneously continuing the initiated development regarding flexible support ships and patrol ships. The capacity to
participate in NATO’s Standing Naval Forces, and participation in the NATO Response Force, is to be prioritised, as this will
make it possible to contribute relevant units and task group staff as well as the requisite command platform. Three patrol
ships are to be procured within the defence agreement period, while four Standard Flex 300 vessels are to be phased out.

Moreover, the Danish Navy’s capacity to perform national tasks, including tasks in the North Atlantic region, is to be upheld.

Several national and international initiatives regarding the state’s responsibility to provide maritime security, to implement
measures to combat the pollution of marine environments and to safeguard the shipping trade against terrorism, increase the
scope of the surveillance and monitoring of civilian shipping in Danish waters, which in turn increases the consumption of
resources. To strengthen the operational performance of the emergency response services, the Air Force and Navy’s rescue
coordination centres are to be merged as a joint rescue coordination centre (SRCC) under Admiral Danish Fleet in Århus.

The Navy’s compulsory military service is to be reorganised so that naval conscripts theoretically undergo the same training
programme as specified for Army conscripts, in that the Navy’s training programme will also include a number of days at sea
for the purpose of recruiting the Navy’s permanent personnel. In addition to this, a number of conscripts will be called up for
nine months as crew members on the Royal Yacht. Conscripts who serve a tour of duty on the Royal Yacht do not have a
subsequent readiness obligation as do other conscripts.

5. The Navy is otherwise to be reorganised as follows:

-  The submarine service will be decommissioned.

-  Danish Task Group Staff will remain in Korsør and will be designated to NATO at high readiness.

-  The Maritime Assistance Service (MAS) under Admiral Danish Fleet in Århus, which is in the preliminary phase of
development, is to be expanded.

-  Two flexible support ships with two operational crews and one maintenance crew are to be placed under the 2nd
Squadron in Frederikshavn. One flexible support ship, with helicopter, will be designated to NATO at high readiness.

-  Three patrol ships with three crews and one maintenance crew are to be placed under the 2nd Squadron in Korsør.
Three corvettes are to be phased out, concurrent to the gradual operational implementation of the patrol ships. One
patrol ship or one corvette will be designated to NATO at high readiness.

-  Ten patrol vessels (Standard Flex 300), including four vessels in combat configuration, with four crews and one
maintenance crew, are to be placed under the 2nd Squadron in Korsør. Two vessels in surveillance configuration with
three crews are to be placed under the 1st Squadron in Korsør. Four vessels for mine counter measure operations with
four crews and one maintenance crew are to be placed under the 2nd Squadron in Frederikshavn. Two vessels in
combat configuration and two for mine counter measure operations are to be designated to NATO at high readiness. Two
Lindormen-class minelayers and one Falster-class minelayer are to be phased out.


-----

-  The chartering of an additional civilian vessel for strategic sea lift, so that the total capacity amounts to two, pursuant to
NATO's Prague Capabilities Commitment.

-  Four Thetis-class offshore patrol vessels (OPV’s) with four crews and one maintenance crew, as well as two fishery
protection vessels and one Agdlek-class inspection cutter with a total of five crews are to be placed under the 1st
Squadron in Frederikshavn.

-  Two training vessels, one transport vessel and three icebreakers are to be placed under the 1st Squadron in
Frederikshavn.

-  Six MK II units with six crews and two environmental units are to be placed under the 1st Squadron in Korsør. Two
environmental units under the 1st Squadron are to remain in Copenhagen. Eight Barsø-class cutters are to be phased
out, concurrent to the gradual operational implementation of the MK II vessels.

-  The Navy’s Frogman Corps (special forces) is to be increased to approximately 90 frogmen, and the Navy’s EOD service
are to be gathered under the Navy’s Diving Centre, which is to be established in Kongsøre.

-  Operational logistics elements are to be established in Korsør and Frederikshavn that can separate the requisite logistics
in conjunction with the deployment of naval units in international operations.

-  The Naval Basic Training School is to be transferred from Auderød to Frederikshavn. The Naval Reserve Officers and
NCO School is to be established in Frederikshavn. Auderød is to be sold.

-  The number of squadrons is to be reduced to two, whereby the 3rd Squadron and the 5th Squadron are to be
decommissioned.

The total number of permanent naval employees is set at roughly 3,400, and the number of response force contracts is set at
around 50, for which approximately 300 sustainment training days are earmarked each year. The Defence Budget is based
on a calculated figure equivalent of some annual 200 full-time conscripts for the Navy.

In determining the basing of naval units and commands, priority has been given to the expedient utilisation of the requisite
maintenance capacity, including the technical competencies, etc., as well as to striking a suitable balance between the naval
bases, as the subsequent consolidation of the various modifications may bring about a need for additional changes.

The following equipment is to be obtained for the Navy:

-  Three patrol ships.

-  Radar and sensor packets for the patrol ships.

-  Four maritime helicopters for use on the Flexible Support Ships and the Patrol Ships.

-  Lynx helicopter upgrade.

-  Preliminary acquisition of air defence missiles, air-to-ground missiles and fire-command and control (C2) integration for
the patrol ships.

-  Insertion crafts vehicles, as well as special equipment for the Frogman Corps.

### Air Force

6. The influx of new transport aircraft (Hercules C130 J) and new helicopters (EH 101) increases the capacity of the Air
Force to support land-based military operations and humanitarian efforts, just as inspection aircraft (Challenger) give the Air
Force sufficient capacity for environmental surveillance and for addressing other domestic needs, including tasks in the North
Atlantic region. In addition, upgraded F-16 aircraft continue to constitute a significant capacity compared to the national


-----

sovereignty defence (defence readiness) and relevant participation in international operations, including participation in the
NATO Response Force. The overall fighter aircraft structure, including the number of operational aircraft, is to be adapted in
accordance with actual tasks and with respect to the F-16 aircraft’s total lifetime and the possibilities of introducing new
fighter aircraft in the long term.

The level of ambition for the Air Force’s contribution of fighter aircraft to international operations is fixed at eight fighter
aircraft at high readiness and eight fighter aircraft at lower readiness.

NATO’s decision to establish a large air operational facility at Karup, which is a significant, high-priority contribution to
NATO’s air defence capacities, includes a need for continued development of the command organisation of the Air Force,
and for the Air Force to make a broadly-scoped contribution to operational personnel and support for the air operational
facility.

Danish participation in NATO’s Prague Capabilities Commitment concerning air to air refuelling and strategic air transport is
to be strengthened.

The Air Force’s compulsory military service is to be reorganised so that Air Force conscripts will in principle undergo the
same training programme as Army and Navy conscripts.

7. In addition, the Air Force will be reorganised as follows:

-  The land-based air defence system (DeHawk) will be abolished.

-  A staff will be established at the Air Tactical Command that can be detached and deployed autonomously or together
with other Danish units.

-  Eight fighter aircraft at high readiness and eight fighter aircraft at lower readiness designated to NATO, which means that
– together with aircraft for national task performance – considering the requisite number of training aircraft, the remaining
flight time of each aircraft, etc., 48 operational F-16 aircraft will be maintained and organised in two squadrons that are
expected to be placed at Skrydstrup Air Base.

-  One transport aircraft at high readiness and an additional two transport aircraft for occasional deployment at lower
readiness are to be designated to NATO. The aircraft are part of a transport unit consisting of four transport aircraft and
three inspection aircraft based in Aalborg.

-  One transport helicopter unit consisting of four helicopters designated to NATO at high readiness. The contributions are
to be part of a helicopter unit consisting of fourteen EH-101 helicopters, which also participate in national rescue efforts,
etc. The helicopters are based at Karup Air Base.

-  One helicopter observation and light transport detachment consisting of four helicopters is to be designated for NATO on
high readiness. The detachment is part of a helicopter company consisting of eight Fennec helicopters.

-  One mobile air operations facility with long-range radar, based at Karup Air Base and Skrydstrup Air Base, designated to
NATO at high readiness. In addition, the overall radar structure consists of one mobile radar (Multebjerg), a stationary air
operations facility (Karup) and two stationary radar facilities (Skagen and Bornholm).

-  In addition to this, the following are designated to NATO at high readiness: one unit for establishing airfields, one
communication unit, one unit for examining and air-evacuating casualties and a staff unit.

-  The Air Force’s Special Training School and the Air Force’s Command and Combat Support School are to be
amalgamated at Karup Air Base.

-  The primary maintenance of transport aircraft, inspection aircraft and helicopters is to be outsourced, the main workshop
at Værløse Air Base is to be closed down and the air base is to be sold.


-----

The total number of permanent Air Force personnel fixed at around 3,400, and the number of response force contracts is set
at around 250, for which approximately 2,500 sustainment training days are earmarked each year. The Defence Budget is
based on a calculated figure equivalent of some 100 full-time conscripts annually for the Air Force.

In determining the placement of the Air Force’s units and commands, priority was given to optimum utilisation of the total
available capacity, as the subsequent consolidation may lead to a need for additional changes.

The following equipment is to be procured for the Air Force:

-  One Hercules C-130-J transport aircraft.

-  Electronic warfare systems.

-  Command and control systems for F-16s, etc., (C3I, Link 16).

-  Upgrading of F-16s (M5).

-  Participation in PCC (air to air refuelling and strategic air transport).

-  Mobile control and reporting centre.

-  Participation in NATO’s jointly funded capability initiatives (PCC), including Allied Ground Surveillance and AWACS.

Denmark continues to participate in the Joint Strike Fighter project.

### Joint Services

8. The disbanding of the mobilisation defence and affiliated structures make it possible - in combination with technology
development – to centralise the administrative functions of Danish Defence to achieve a streamlined, efficient utilisation of
the available resources. Centralisation of the administration also leads to fewer levels of administration thereby shortening
the chains of command and enhancing interdepartmental resource utilisation.

In order to streamline and improve the efficiency of the Department of the Ministry of Defence and to strengthen the lines of
communication between the Minister of Defence and the Chief of Danish Defence, the Department is to be reorganised so
that the activities of the Department are focused on strategic development and overall management and control. As a result
of this, a number of tasks are to be transferred from the Department to the Defence Command. The Defence Staff is to be
located in Copenhagen as close to the MoD as possible.

A powerful, centralised financial department is to be established under the Defence Command, and the requisite qualitative
and quantitative resources are to be allocated for the financial management of the armed forces.

9. In the light of the above, the joint military sphere is to be reorganised as follows:

-  The Defence Personnel Service will be represented at the strategic management level of the Danish Defence concerning
personnel-related matters. The Personnel Service is to be established on the basis of the Personnel Staff of the Defence
Command, similar functions at the Royal Danish Administration of Navigation and Hydrography, the Defence
Construction Service and the Home Guard Command, as well as the personnel administration departments of
subordinate authorities. The Defence Personnel Service will be located partly in Copenhagen and partly in Hjørring.

-  The Defence Material Service is to be established and charged with managing the entire material area, based on
segments of the existing material staff and information staff of the Defence Command, similar functions under the Royal
Danish Administration of Navigation and Hydrography, the Home Guard Command and the three existing material
commands as well as the Defence Research Service. The Defence Material Service will be represented at the strategic
management level of the Danish Defence. In the area of ITC, the launched outsourcing procedure is to continue so that
Danish Defence will primarily run the operational ITC systems in future. A maintenance facility organisation comprising

10


-----

national and regional maintenance centres and repair facilities is to be established under the Material Service.
Furthermore, a depot organisation is to be established comprising a main depot in Skrydstrup and a number of issuing
depots affiliated with Danish Defence units. The Defence Material Service is to be placed in Vedbæk.

-  The Defence Research Establishment is to be decommissioned as a unit within the Defence College’s organisation and
established as an individual department within the Defence Material Service.

-  The Defence Construction and Establishment Service will be represented at the strategic management level of the
Danish Defence and will be established on the basis of the existing infrastructure segment of the Material Staff of the
Defence Command, the Defence Construction Service and subordinate authorities, as well as on the basis of
corresponding functions of the Home Guard Command and the Royal Danish Administration of Navigation and
Hydrography. The Service will be charged with the management of all tasks within the establishment sphere. A number of
regional support centres (“custodial departments") are to be established for addressing local needs in relation to
authorities, units and establishments. The Defence Construction and Establishment Service is to be located in Hjørring.
The properties of the Defence Construction Service in Copenhagen and Viborg are to be sold.

-  An Accounting Service is to be set up for managing the overall accounting activities of Danish Defence, including
development, data validation, management of financial controller activities, and more. The Defence Accounting Service is
to be situated in Hjørring. The Defence Accounting Service will be represented at the strategic management level of the
Danish Defence and will be located in Hjørring. .

-  The commenced centralisation of the Defence Health Service is to continue and a number of regional healthcare centres
are to be established for servicing all military authorities and units in the region concerned. The Health Service is to be
placed at Skalstrup Air Base, and the Jægersborg Barracks are to be sold.

-  The commenced development of the Royal Danish Defence College, which in general is leading to the reinforcement of
core military competencies in international policy, strategy and military operations, as well as military command and
management, is to continue.

-  Danish Defence’s communication is to be strengthened by founding the Defence Communication Service under the Chief
of Defence. The Communication Service shall manage the internal and external communication of the armed forces and
thereby ensure the highest possible degree of transparency in defence matters.

-  Organisational matters and division of task and responsibilities between the Defence Information and Welfare Service,
including the National Service Board, the Defence Communication Service and the Defence Personnel Service will be
evaluated during the defence agreement period.

-  The number of personnel to be deployed in international staff services is to be adapted to the reductions achieved in
NATO’s command structure.

-  The Greenland Command and the Command of the Faeroe Islands are to continue as autonomous military authorities
and are to be reorganised for current developments in the complicated Defence tasks in the North Atlantic. The
demobilisation of the radar station and naval radio base on the Faeroe Islands is currently being considered, in
cooperation with NATO and with the involvement of the Regional Government of the Faeroe Islands.

-  A working group is to be established with the aim of analysing pros and cons, including financial aspects, of
amalgamating the three operational commands and the associated tasks in one joint operational command.

In determining the placement of functional services of Danish Defence, priority has been given to exploiting Danish
Defence’s existing establishments and to counterbalancing regional political factors.

The total human resources allocated to the joint military sphere involve approximately 7,850 full-time equivalents.

### Home Guard

10. The disbanding of the mobilisation defence and the territorial defence, in their previous form, makes it possible for the
Home Guard to target its efforts on total defence. The overarching structure of the Home Guard will be divided into an active
and a passive structure.

It is a prerequisite that personnel in the Home Guard’s active structure have undergone the by law required training of 250300 hours within the first three years of service, including a 100 hours basic training programme, in order to be issued
weapons. In order to remain part of the active structure a minimum of 24 hours operationally relevant service is required
each year. An additional requirement for annual shooting practice and training is laid down for personnel, who have a
weapon issued. The active structure is made up of personnel with an adequate training level, which will be evaluated
annually.

The active members of the Home Guard are, pending their level of activity in activities of the Home Guard, part of the Home
Guard’s reaction force, the Naval Home Guard’s seaborne units and other units within the Home Guard. In particular the
tasks of the so-called 3,000 man force will be refocused in order to allow the Home Guard to provide a similar reaction force
divided across the five Local Defence Regions in the future called Total Defence Regions. The aforementioned personnel will
be trained equivalently to the total defence training given to conscripts in the Armed Forces. It is foreseen that the Home
Guard will be aimed at total defence and joint contributions together with the National Rescue Preparedness Corps and the
Total Defence Force. The Home Guard will among others provide a command structure within the Total Defence Regions, in
which the other parts of the Armed Forces contribute 800-1,200 reserve officers and NCOs able to command personnel and
formations from the Home Guards and the Total Defence Force.

When employed the Naval Home Guard will continue to be part of the navy’s operational structure, taking part in the national
maritime tasks, including general maritime surveillance, assistance to among others the police and the Customs Service.
The Naval Home Guard will also take part in the maritime environmental preparedness and search and rescue organisation.
Measures of effectiveness for the operational tasks are to be laid down, including the ability to react on alerts.

The passive structure of the Home Guard constitutes the remaining members of the Home Guard, who will not be issued
equipment and weapons.

To exploit the synergy between the capacities of Danish Defence and the Home Guard, the Home Guard is to be
incorporated into the support structure of Danish Defence. In addition to this, integration in the future total defence structure
is being considered in conjunction with considerations on how to incorporate the tasks of the civilian readiness in Danish
Defence. Further integration is to be implemented so that the Home Guard maintains its identity.

Personnel who have completed the conscript training programme provided by the other armed forces may join the Home
Guard forthwith on a voluntary basis, in order to be utilised in the task force mounted by the Home Guard for performing total
defence tasks.

11. On this basis, the Home Guard is to be reorganised as follows:

-  The Home Guard will be divided into an active and a passive structure.

-  The future role of the Home Guard Command is to be evaluated further and in connection with the considerations
concerning the possible integration of the National Rescue Preparedness Corps’s structure and tasks into the general
structure of the Armed Forces as laid down in this document paragraph 12. The Home Guard is to have a seat in the
working group.

-  The Home Guard is to be integrated into the defence support structure.

-  The local defence regions are to be called total defence regions. Regions and districts are to be reorganised according to
need.

12


-----

-  The tasks of the so-called “3000-man force” are to be redefined, and a task force of corresponding size is to be
established and dispersed among the five total defence regions.

-  Utilising the 800-1,200 reserve officers and NCOs a command structure is to be established in each of the five regions
capable of commanding the total defence force when activated.

-  The military authorities of the Home Guard are to be serviced in future by Danish Defence’s remaining depot and
maintenance structure.

The Home Guard’s appropriation of approximately DKK 700 million (2004 price index) is to be scaled down concurrent to the
integration within Danish Defence’s support structure and to the redefinition of the Home Guard’s tasks and organisation to
an appropriation of approximately DKK 430 million (2004 price index).

The following equipment is to be acquired for the Home Guard:

-  Personal equipment for high priority units.

-  Five vessels to replace five MHV 90 class vessels.

-  Simulation equipment (including naval simulator)

-  Equipment for containing terrorism activities (equipment for surveillance, guarding, barricading, etc.).

-  Maritime environmental equipment for the Naval Home Guard vessels.

-  Communication equipment.

-  Observation equipment.

The Home Guard shall also take over relevant equipment that has been phased out by the Armed Forces.

### The National Rescue Preparedness Corps

12. The civilian preparedness with affiliated budget has been transferred to the sphere of the Minister of Defence as of 1
February 2004. It is agreed that the political accord on the rescue preparedness after 2002 is to be respected.

By centralising the administration of the national emergency management effort and Danish Defence’s tasks into an
integrated structure, total defence force is strengthened, while simultaneously synergising and simplifying the overall
structure of total defence

A task group has been appointed and charged with considering how to incorporate the structure and tasks of the national
emergency management effort with Danish Defence’s general structure, including the way and extent to which joint utilisation
of functional services, barracks, schools, etc., can occur. The results of the task group’s efforts must be presented by the end
of 2004.

It is generally perceived that two factors are of particular importance for the successful integration of the National Rescue
Preparedness Corps with Danish Defence. Firstly, it must be ensured that the requisite reorganisation of Danish Defence is
carried out, so that sufficient focus is brought to bear on the management of the emergency management tasks, and on
maintaining and developing the core competencies that exist in the national emergency management structure. Secondly, it
must be ensured that the efficient management of the daily emergency management organisation is upheld and developed.
The mandate of the task group is enclosed as an appendix.

It has been assessed that the current radio systems of the emergency management authorities meet the daily
communication needs of the emergency management authorities, but that a need may exist to strengthen the communication
capacity in the event of large-scale emergency situations. In light of this, a committee is to be appointed and commissioned

13


-----

with the drafting of a proposal for a new nationwide radio communication system for the overall emergency management
effort. It is assessed that the system can be implemented from 2007, at the earliest. For this reason, a proposal is also to be
drafted regarding the preliminary bolstering of the communication within the emergency management system in conjunction
with large-scale emergency situations. The expenditures connected with this are to be covered by the defence appropriation
within approximately DDK 15 million. The results of analyses, etc., are to be presented to the accord parties.

### Other Issues

13. DKK 2 million is to be allocated for the work performed by “The Blue Beret” association in support of personnel who have
been deployed in international service.

14. DKK 7 million of the Ministry of Defence budget is to be allocated each year for carrying out specific projects related to
defence policy and security policy at the Danish Institute for International Studies (DIIS). An additional DKK 5 million and
equivalent of approximately 10 fulltime employees are designated for the establishment of an independent security studies
research capacity, with focus on defence policy, organisationally linked to the Defence College.

15. Danish Defence’s personnel composition is to be continuously adapted, under consideration of Danish Defence’s task
performance, personnel-related flexibility, recruitment potential, structural adjustments, and more. The Armed Forces are to
be a modern, dynamic and attractive workplace, capable of recruiting both genders. The Armed Forces will therefore focus
on ensuring that recruitment for the Armed Forces follows the general development in society, aiming at a broad and varied
recruitment base representing the diversity of the Danish society. The requirements including physical and psychological
requirements for joining the Danish Defence are to be maintained.

An anonymous survey concerning attitudes to the mission and the local population will be carried out among Danish soldiers
in international missions. The survey will also evaluate the training efforts of privates and officers to stressful tasks abroad in
order to assess if the existing preparations and training is adequate. The result of the survey will be presented to the accord
parties.

The personnel agreement system within the responsibility of the Ministry of Defence is sought to be simplified following
negotiations with relevant personnel organisations. The manning level of the Danish Defence counted in full-time equivalents
are to be reduced from approximately 29,000, of which 6,500 are full-time conscript equivalents, at the end of 2004 to
approximately 26,400 full-time equivalents, of which 2,450 are full-time conscript equivalents, by the end of 2009. The
personnel composition, etc., will be indicated in the annual appropriation act.

Reserve personnel will continue to be of great significance to Danish Defence’s task performance in relation to international
missions, but also in relation to the training of Danish Defence units and total defence. As a result of the demobilisation of the
mobilisation defence and affiliated structures, the quantitative need will decline and for this reason the number of reserve
officers in the structure is to be adjusted during the accord period.

16. It is generally agreed that the daily operation of Danish Defence must be streamlined and trimmed for actual assignments.
Therefore, relevant efficiency engineering and adjustments of the organisation must be carried out at regular intervals to
ensure ideal, relevant operational capacity. Large-scale structural reorganisation measures will be presented to the accord
parties.

17. There is also further agreement that the budget must be observed. Unforeseen expenditures arising during the period
must be offset by the requisite adjustment of organisations, other activities or similar. Such adjustments must be
incorporated in the annual appropriation bill, based on discussions with the accord parties.

18. Detailed information on structural issues and the consumption of resources, including personnel, will be indicated in the
annual appropriation act. The annual appropriation bill, as well as the acts that implement the budget, are to be discussed in
advance with the accord parties. In addition, the agreeing parties are to be continuously informed on matters within the
framework of this agreement that are of significance to the personnel structure and the acquisition of equipment. Moreover, a
statement of activities, including deployments and redeployments, the financial situation of Danish Defence and on the
implementation of the accord, especially on the developments af the functional services is to be prepared each year with a
deadline of 1 January. The statement is to be sent to the Defence Committee of the Parliament and should lay the

14


-----

groundwork for a discussion between the agreeing parties. The purpose of the discussions is inter alia to consider necessary
corrections to the development of the Danish Defence during the agreement period in order to ensure ideal relevance of
Danish Defence and its capacities and to evaluate the coherence of the activities, efforts and economy of the Home Guard.

19. The accord parties are to be informed of the participation of Danish Defence in international operations, including under
the auspices of the UN, NATO and - in the event that Danish Defence opt-out is rescinded – the EU, whereby the parties will
determine their position to this in conjunction with the relevant parliamentary discussions.

20. It is generally agreed that the coordination of the military and civilian effort in international operations must be
strengthened, to synergise the individual efforts and heighten the visible effect of the overall Danish effort. A working group,
including Non-Governmental Organizations, under the chairmanship of the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs is to be
established to draw up procedures for the cooperation between emergency agencies and the Danish Armed Forces. The
result will be presented to and debated by the accord parties.

21. The “Act on the Aims, Tasks and Organisation, etc. of the Armed Forces,” the “Act on Danish Defence personnel”, the
“Act on Conscription” and the “Home Guard Act” are to be amended in accordance with the present Danish Defence accord.

22. A detailed consolidation of the accord’s individual projects will be implemented up to autumn 2004. The results will be
presented to the accord parties to ensure the requisite structural and financial coherence, including an assessment of the
possibilities within the financial framework to obtain additional operational capacities.

23. The scope of the reorganisation of Danish Defence is such that substantial initial investment is required. It is estimated
that this investment will amount to around DKK 1.5 billion, broken down as DKK 0.8 – 1.0 billion for buildings and
refurbishment of buildings, and up to DKK 0.5 – 0.7 billion for personnel-related costs. A final account of the implementation
expenditure will be prepared in conjunction with the consolidation of the accord during the course of 2004.

It is agreed that the implementation expenditure is to be kept within Danish Defence budget and that the reorganisation of
Danish Defence must therefore be implemented over a period of time. The importance of the implementation funding not
being obtained by making actual operating cutbacks is also agreed. This will affect the operational capacities of Danish
Defence, including the ability to deploy these capacities in the short and long term, and that this would otherwise have a
negative impact on Danish Defence personnel. It is also important that the international commitment, and the training carried
out for this, including the participation in NATO’s Response Force, can be upheld, and that the support structures must be
capable of functioning properly during the implementation period.

In the light of this, the parties agree that the implementation funding can be obtained by reducing the ordinary building and
construction programmes and by delaying the employment of some of the permanent military staff until later in the accord
period and using the saved wage sums for implementation expenditure. The parties also agree that Danish Defence – after
the usual presentation to the appropriation authorities – may directly spend the revenue from the sale of properties resulting
from the transfer of military authorities and units on the related investment expenditures or for acquiring properties for the
relocating of the military authorities and units in question. The proceeds from the sale of Danish Defence properties are to be
placed in Section 35, from which the above-mentioned expenditures are to be effected. Expenditures will also be effected
from here for the new NATO headquarters.

It is estimated that the total personnel adjustments, including dismissals, resulting from the present agreement cannot be
carried out solely by natural wastage. The job and training-consultant scheme for supporting the employment and training of
discharged or dismissed personnel is to be continued. Personnel adjustments resulting from the structural modifications are
to be implemented in accordance with previous practice in so far as retraining, supplementary training, etc. and withdrawal
terms in general, including note no. 101 (Finance Act 2004) regarding access to acquire up to an additional 10-year
pensionable age for personnel covered by the Civilian Worker Act. The affected personnel are to be offered other
employment within Danish Defence system wherever possible.

Furthermore it is agreed that a working group under Defence Command Denmark is to be established to evaluate the
beneficial arrangements for the personnel which have been a part of the Danish Defence Agreement 2000 – 2004 in order
soonest possible and no later than 1 October 2004 to present proposals for further possible steps within the existing
framework. The personnel organisations will be included in this work.

15


-----

An implementation plan is to be drafted and presented to the group of accord parties.

24. The defence budget for the accord period has been established on the assumption that the defence budget will be
adjusted according to previous practice[1]:

The defence budget (all the amounts are stated according to the 2004 price index).

**All amounts are MDKK**

|2005|2006|2007|2008|2009|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|18,600|19,300|19,300|19,200|19,100|



To this should be added the transfer of the national emergency management agency, with affiliated budget (approximately
DKK 450 million) to the sphere of the Minister of Defence as from 1 February 2004.

Danish Defence is to be fully compensated for the operation of the ice-breaking services and for any new acquisitions for this.

25. An allocation of DKK 900 million p.a. of total defence budget for 2005 is earmarked for the participation of Danish armed
forces in international operations. In addition, DKK 50 million is to be earmarked for international police readiness effort. The
reserve totalling DKK 950 million is to be allocated to Section 35. General reserves may only be used following a decision by
the Government and the Parliament. The reserve may only be activated for international operations. A less consumption of
up to DKK 200 million can be carried forward to the subsequent fiscal year. If more than DKK 200 million are not spent in a
fiscal year, the remainder will revert to the national treasury. In case of a possible excess consumption the Parliament will
decide how to provide the necessary funding.

26. Investment in equipment is to be increased and targeted in relation to relevant, future operational capacities to an extent
that assists in reducing the “technology gap” between Denmark and certain other allies. It should also be ensured that
Denmark can live up to the commitment to participate in NATO’s capability initiatives, including strategic sea and air
transport, air tanking, etc., stated by the Government during the NATO Summit in autumn 2002. Approximately DKK 2.845
billion is to be set aside each year for equipment investment and just as in the present accord period, there must be a
general balance between payments and allocations for new projects throughout the accord period. The equipment debt at
the end of 2009 will thus correspond to the debt at the end of 2004 of approximately DKK 6.7 billion (2004 price index). An
equipment survey is enclosed.

1 In addition to the defence budget, Danish Defence may apply any earned interest income under the scheme on independent liquidity. In
other regards, the defence budget is regulated according to the same rules as the rest of the national budget. Consumption in excess of
or less than the budget may be carried forward to the subsequent financial year. The carrying forward of appropriations over the amount
of 2% of the appropriation may only be performed if so accepted by the Finance Committee of the Danish Parliament. However, Danish
Defence may – as a result of the significant structural changes – carry forward consumption in excess of or less than the budget of up to
4% to the subsequent financial year during the accord period.

### Joint Planning of Civilian and Military Efforts in International Operations

Denmark’s increased military commitment to international operations of recent years has raised the issue of whether it would
be expedient to strengthen the coordination of civilian and military efforts. New experience has been gained in humanitarian
aid and reconstruction aid connected to the resolution of military conflicts. In the West Balkans, Eritrea, Afghanistan and Iraq,
the humanitarian aid has been more or less based on specific agreements among the humanitarian organisations and the
military in the form of logistics support and the removal of landmines, etc. It is common to these situations that they involved
extensive destruction of local social structures and generated a need to involve many organisations in resolving the conflict.

The purpose of the overall Danish effort in a conflict area is to stabilise and normalise the situation. Water, electricity,
transport, police, basic administration and a functioning trade and industry are all basic prerequisites for achieving this goal.
International crisis management operations are therefore not only a military task. For the civilian population in a crisis area
improving their social and economic situation in the area and improving the security situation are directly related. For this
reason, the overall Danish effort in a conflict area must therefore involve a greater degree of coordination and goalorientation than before, so that an area of conflict can be stabilised and normalised as quickly as possible. This can be
instrumental in reducing the military operation and in ensuring the greatest possible effect of the Danish resources that are
applied within an internationally coordinated framework.

The Government intends to strengthen the capability of Danish Defence to carry out international military operations in the
years to come. At the same time, the need for deploying military forces across a broad spectrum of tasks and in vastly
different situations seems to be increasing. Denmark should expect to remain in Iraq where useful experience in coordinating
the civilian and military efforts has already been gained. It is expected that the international effort in Afghanistan will be
enlarged to include additional provincial reconstruction teams, which by nature are an expression of a coordinated effort
involving civilian and military involvement in the form of a civilian reconstruction effort under military protection. The need for
an increased Danish effort in this area cannot be ruled out. A Danish military force is also present in Kosovo. The Danish
contingent is expected to be reduced concurrent to the general adjustment of KFOR.

It is difficult to predict where the next international military conflicts will take place. Increasing focus is being brought to bear
on conflicts in the African continent where the international community is intensifying conflict-prevention and peacekeeping
efforts. Other areas of conflict include the greater Middle East region or the Caucasus.

The take-over of crisis management in Bosnia by the EU is expected to serve as an example of how future military
operations become incorporated in a more broadly coordinated effort. It is expected, therefore, that the EU will be charged
with the overall strategic command. In this context, the EU will have the opportunity to demonstrate the simultaneous
application of a number of foreign policy instruments that are available to the Union. Thus the operation will encompass a
combination of a military force, the build up of a local police force and court system, as well as support for the development
of democracy and social progress in Bosnia. Denmark will not be able to participate under the auspices of the EU as a result
of the Denmark's opt-out regarding EU defence policy.

The security situation may in some instances cause non-governmental organisations, such as private emergency relief
organisations and international organisations, to be initially unable or willing to operate in a crisis area. Situations may also
arise in which international or local police are not present. In such situations the military force will be compelled to provide a
more limited, specific assistance in the local area, as well as handle assignments such as the re-establishment of the police
force and the judicial system. This is not a core competency of the military force, nor should it be, in the opinion of the
Government. In situations where the military force must perform such tasks as these in the military task force area, the
Government wants to ensure that the military force has the requisite financial means and possibly other support, including
advisory services. The transfer of the Emergency Management Agency to the Ministry of Defence also prepares for the
possibility of exploiting the unusual competencies which the Emergency Management Agency has at its disposal in
conjunction with assistance in humanitarian emergencies.

As a security situation gradually improves, it will usually be possible for other civilian governmental and non-governmental
organisations to operate in the area. In this context it is important that the military force’s performance of these tasks is
reduced as much as possible, and that the emergency relief organisations or private enterprises with the requisite expertise

18


-----

come in and shoulder the task. Military forces will still be able to support the performance of such tasks by civilian
organisations to the extent that the forces have the relevant equipment and expertise at their disposal.

Therefore, the Government wishes to use a new initiative to ensure that the application of Denmark’s national resources in
international crisis management operations is focused, effective and coordinated, regardless of the security situation.

The planning and preparation of an international crisis management operation in which Danish military units are deployed in
an autonomous sphere of responsibility must, from the operation’s outset, include all Danish contingents that are included in
the organisation, as wellas articulate the objectives for the conclusion of the efforts. In other words, activities that are
implemented by the military, the emergency management corps, the police, the foreign service and – to the greatest possible
extent – the private relief organisations. This will occur in cooperation and dialogue with all of the organisations and by
exploiting the fundamental differences and competencies of the various organisations.

The aim is to provide stabilising efforts that meet elementary humanitarian needs, assist vulnerable and exposed groups and
generate direct results for the local populace in the deployment area. Examples of this are the re-establishment of
infrastructure that ensures access for actual humanitarian relief efforts, the re-establishment of public buildings, including
local administration, exercise of authority, police and judicial system, schools and health centres, the re-establishment of
water and electricity and support for civilian relief organisations.

As part of the Government’s initiative, a standing group of public officials is to be appointed for planning and coordinating the
Danish military and civilian humanitarian effort. The participants of the public officials committee will come from the Ministry
of Defence, the Defence Command, the Emergency Management Agency and the Danish Police. The Ministry of Foreign
Affairs will chair the public officials committee and ensure coordination with relevant Danish relief organisations, as well as
any private enterprises. To strengthen the joint planning and coordination of the Danish civilian and military effort, if at all
possible a management unit will be established under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the operational area within or near the
Danish military contingent. The unit will be charged with contributing to the coordination, information sharing and
improvement of the overall efficiency, in conjunction with the Danish activities. To ensure a fast, effective effort aimed at the
specific needs, the management unit will take decisions regarding the specific project proposals in the light of the criteria that
apply to stabilising efforts. If the set-up of such a management unit is not possible or necessary, it will be possible to affiliate
one or more advisors with special expertise in relevant areas, to the military force.

A focused Danish humanitarian effort must occur to the greatest possible extent within the sphere of responsibility in which
the Danish military force is deployed. The basic assumption is that private Danish and international relief organisations
should be in charge of implementing the stabilising efforts funded by Denmark. The humanitarian efforts of other
organisations in the deployment area should be coordinated as much as possible with the Danish efforts.

The stabilising efforts will continue to be financed under the aid to developing countries programme, and it will be possible for
the specific initiatives to be implemented by civilian relief organisations. The Government also wishes to set aside DKK 15
million in the appropriation act for civilian activities that can be performed by Danish military forces when the security
situation makes it difficult for civilian organisations to operate in an area. If the funds are not used, they can be used on other
humanitarian aid.

The direct joint planning of the military and civilian effort does not involve any organisational or decision-making hierarchy
among the various organisations. The effort will involve the setting up of a framework or a set of rules for the joint effort. In
this conjunction, the Government will work to further the development of the dialogue and the mutual understanding between
the civilian and military organisations via the teamwork in the Humanitarian Contact Group.

Furthermore, the Government will heighten the priority of the existing joint training and education of civilian and military
organisations and continuously evaluate the cooperation for the purpose of increasing the personnel’s capacity and mutual
understanding among the key Danish organisations.

### The Mandate of the Task Group Regarding the Transfer of the National Emergency Management Agency under Danish Defence

A decision has been made to gather the tasks of the national emergency management agency under Danish Defence. In the
light of this decision, a task group has been appointed and charged with the task of drafting a proposal for the best possible
integration of the national emergency management response and Danish Defence.

It is generally perceived that two factors are of particular importance for the successful integration of the national emergency
management effort and Danish Defence. Firstly, it must be ensured that the integration of the national emergency
management agency and Danish Defence causes the greatest possible synergising and strengthening of the overall
emergency management capability. Secondly, it must be ensured that the efficient management of the daily emergency
management organisation is upheld and developed.

It is noted that the political agreement on the emergency management organisation after 2002 which was entered into by all
parties of the Danish parliament on 21 June 2002 runs until the end of 2006.

In the light of this, the task group must set up models for the integration of the national emergency management agency and
Danish Defence. Among other things, the models must involve proposals for

-  Handling official tasks and tasks regarding coordination, management and development of the overall emergency
management organisation.

-  The voluntary aspect.

-  The future command structure.

-  The future establishment structure.

-  The future conscript training programme.

-  The future depot, maintenance facilities and distribution structure.

-  The future school structure.

-  The future, interdepartmental services within Danish Defence, such as the Personnel Service, Material Service,
Construction Service, Accounting Service, etc.

-  International missions

-  The chemical and nuclear emergency response, including a consideration of the working relationships with the
radiological and biological emergency response units.

The most expedient implementation of each individual element, including the date of integration, should be considered.

In conjunction with setting up the models, the task group must also describe the technical and financial benefits and
drawbacks connected to the models.

The task group comprises representatives from the Department of the Ministry of Defence (chairman), the Defence
Command, the Department of the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Justice, the Emergency
Management Agency and the Department of the Ministry of Finance.

The Agency for Governmental Management, which possesses unusual expertise regarding the most appropriate
organisation of public officials, will assist the task group in connection with the planning, process organisation, analyses and
preparation of papers, including model proposals, etc.

The results of the task group’s efforts are to be presented to the Government’s Coordination Committee by the end of 2004.
