# Hungary’s National
 Military Strategy

Foreword

At the beginning of the second decade of the 21st century, emerging security chal­
lenges that stem from an unpredictable global environment have given rise to the
importance of the role of armed forces, including the Hungarian Defence Forces. At
the same time, the force structure – even having undergone several rearrangements
in the past twenty years – and the inherited defence equipment are only partially
capable of dealing with the diversified and complex challenges of the future. The
formation and development of a defence force capable of successfully responding
to both conventional and emerging security challenges requires significant time
and resources. The experiences of today are insufficient in themselves to prepare
us for the conflicts of tomorrow; we also have to timely recognize the changes that
will shape the future. By taking into account the experiences of present conflicts
and also the predicted potential future challenges, the goal of the National Military
Strategy is to determine, in the mid- and long term, the scope of the use of the Hun­
garian Defence Forces and the directions of their capability development.

The Hungarian Defence Forces are on the road to modernization. The National Mili­
tary Strategy is a significant milestone on this road. Taking into consideration the
possibilities, the Strategy provides an ambitious plan for the future of the defence
force. We are well aware that we have taken on ourselves an extraordinary task: we
are to lay a new foundation for our defence force both in moral and professional
terms in a period beset by financial difficulties. The road ahead requires clear vision,
strategic thinking, resolve, perseverance and – above all – rigorous implementation.

We have to abandon the previously denizened, comfortable, but altogether danger­
ous attitude that national defence is feasible without substantive military strength,
relying on a bare minimum of own capabilities, and trusting solely in the solidarity of
NATO and EU nations. This approach, which is a far cry from that of the Alliance, can
only lead down the bitter path of further deterioration of our defence force. Only a
strong, confident and proud defence force can be of service to Hungary, Europe, and


-----

NATO. The new National Military Strategy is a reflection of this mentality, and it pro­
vides directions for the renewal of the Hungarian Defence Forces. The Strategy that
is firmly grounded in reality allows us to avoid the pitfalls of this road. I am confident
that the Strategy will serve as guidance for interested fellow countrymen as well, and
as such, increase the support for the case of national defence within our society.

### Hungary’s National Military Strategy*

I. Introduction

1 The purpose of the National Military Strategy (hereinafter referred to as: Strat­

egy) is to determine the strategic objectives, directions, tools and resources
needed for the Hungarian Defence Forces to fulfil their mission in line with the
Fundamental Law of Hungary, the legal regulations determining the activities of
the defence sector, the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation’s (hereinafter referred
to as NATO) Strategic Concept and the European Security Strategy, and based
upon the principles stipulated in the National Security Strategy.

2 The Strategy is one of the important tools of the modernization of the Hungar­

ian Defence Forces; it provides mid- and long-term guidance for the Hungarian
Defence Forces, determining their role in defending Hungary and asserting her
interests. For that purpose the Strategy sets the main principles of using and
maintaining and gives directions for developing the armed force. It also deter­
mines the purposes and means by which the Hungarian Defence Forces shall
become a modern force with flexibly and efficiently applicable capabilities and
a balanced structure.

3 The available budgetary resources determine the implementation of the Strat­

egy; their scarcity, however, also fosters the adoption of a new efficiency driven
approach. After putting an end to the decline of capabilities of the Hungar­
ian Defence Forces the consistent implementation of the Strategy provides a

-----

chance for creating a transformed, resource efficient, sustainable, well-organ­
ised armed force based on solid foundations, which shall gradually become
modernised with the increase of available budgetary resources.

4 The Strategy shall contribute to establishing a thriving contact between the vol­

untary armed force and the Hungarian people, resulting in its prestige increas­
ing within society. An important element of strengthening that relation is a welloperated voluntary reserve system.

II. Fundamentals

5 The changes of extraordinary dynamics and magnitude in the global security

environment come together with unpredictability. Even in the early 21st century,
military force can still play a primary role in a regional conflict in Europe and its
neighbouring regions. All that still necessitates maintaining a credible military
force.

6 In our globalised world, due to the application of modern technology and en­

hanced economic cooperation, individual states and regions increasingly de­
pend on each other, and their security is becoming increasingly less separable.
The external and internal factors of security become connected, and emerg­
ing crises have an increasing impact on international stability. Crises emerging
even in regions of significant distance may have a direct or indirect impact on
Hungary’s security.

7 The security of the transatlantic area is indivisible. The stable transatlantic rela­

tions as well as the European integration are the cornerstones of Hungary’s se­
curity and stability. It is in our fundamental interest to maintain a long-term and
balanced transatlantic relationship, the prerequisite of which is the strengthen­
ing of European defence capabilities.


-----

8 Hungary is committed to the maintenance of international peace and security.

Strengthening international mechanisms serving the prevention of crises and
the management of conflicts is of fundamental importance from the aspect
of Hungary’s security. For that reason Hungary strives to fulfil an active role in
global and regional organisations forming a part of the international security
structure.

9 Hungary does not consider any country as its enemy, and strives to settle any

disputes peacefully, in accordance with the principles of the Charter of the Unit­
ed Nations (hereinafter referred to as UN) and the norms of international law.

10 In case of aggression against Hungary – in accordance with the provisions of

Article 51 of the Charter of the UN – the country shall take all necessary meas­
ures to defend its independence, territory, airspace, population and material
goods.

11 The defence of the country is a cause of national importance comprising of

two basic pillars: sovereign national force and Allied cooperation. In order for
the Hungarian Defence Forces to fulfil their constitutional obligations and those
deriving from Hungary’s NATO and European Union (hereinafter referred to as
EU) membership, the development of sovereign national force is essential.

12 Security is complex and its elements are closely connected, therefore, the is­

sue of national defence cannot be interpreted separately from other fields of
security on its own. The management of security challenges reaches beyond
the competence of individual ministries, and therefore requires harmonised
governmental cooperation.

13 The Hungarian Defence Forces are the main guarantor of Hungary’s sovereignty

and territorial integrity. The Hungarian Defence Forces play a decisive role in the
protection of Hungary’s freedom, constitutional order and security against any


-----

external military threats. Their recognized performance in international opera­
tions has a significant impact on Hungary’s international prestige and influence,
contributing to the increase of the country’s ability to assert its interests.

14 The Hungarian Defence Forces must possess the fundaments of the capabili­

ties needed for the armed defence of the country, to be able to expediently de­
velop those capabilities in the case of the deterioration of the security environ­
ment. The sovereign national force must be developed gradually in a planned
manner taking Hungary’s NATO responsibilities into consideration.

15 The Hungarian Defence Forces participate in operations that contribute to

strengthening the security of Hungary and its Allies. Their external employment
takes place upon a legal decision following the proper international legal au­
thorisation, within the framework of international organisations or in an ad-hoc
coalition, along common values and interests.

16 The voluntary reserve system is an integral part of a modern armed force based

upon professional and contracted personnel. It provides a framework for the
training of our fellow countrymen wishing to take an active role in the defence
of the homeland and their employment in peacetime and under special legal
order. According to the stipulations in the legal regulations, during a state of
national crisis or a state of preventive defence, subject to the decision by the
Parliament on introducing military service based on conscription, the Hungar­
ian Defence Forces also rely upon the military service of adult male Hungarian
citizens with a residence in Hungary.

17 The prestige of the Hungarian Defence Forces by society is of fundamental

significance from the aspect of successful performance of their tasks. The edu­
cation of the on-coming generation in national defence and its familiarization
with military values have an important role in increasing the prestige and public
acceptance of the Hungarian Defence Forces.


-----

III. Operational Environment

18 The importance of non-military aspects of security is constantly increasing,

however, that does not go together with a decrease of the role of military fac­
tors. The successful implementation of the tasks of the Hungarian Defence
Forces is decisively influenced by the conditions in which they must execute
their mission. The necessary capabilities can only be determined by taking into
consideration the challenges arising from the security environment, the rights
and obligations deriving from Hungary’s membership in the Alliance and ratified
international conventions, the characteristics of the anticipated employment of
the military force and the available financial and human resources.

A) Security Environment

19 Hungary’s security environment is characterised simultaneously by develop­

ments strengthening and weakening the stability of our region including our
country. The tendencies prevailing in the immediate vicinity of Hungary shift to­
wards stability, however, the security of those regions previously struck by crises
remains fragile. Global developments make the security environment difficult to
predict in the long run, which, in the worst case, can halt or even reverse the
positive changes currently witnessed in our region. The emerging security chal­
lenges of a global scale are expected to significantly increase in importance in
the mid- and long-term.

Developments Strengthening Security and Stability

20 The security of the immediate environment of Hungary is fundamentally stable;

most countries in the region have become or wish to become members of
Euro-Atlantic organisations.


-----

21 The current level of the threat of a conventional attack against Hungary and its

Allies is marginal and current processes also underline that in the mid-term. The
probability of an attack with the use of non-conventional means with limited
purpose is also rather low, however, it cannot be ruled out completely.

22 Adopting its new Strategic Concept in Lisbon NATO has taken another signifi­

cant step towards being capable of successfully responding to the challenges
of the 21st century. The Strategic Concept determines the directions through
which the Alliance – adapting to the changed security environment – is capable
of fulfilling its role stipulated in the North Atlantic Treaty (Washington Treaty) and
ensuring the defence of its member states.

23 New structures and mechanisms have been elaborated in the EU’s Common

Security and Defence Policy (hereinafter referred to as CSDP), which may fur­
ther increase the role of the EU in security policy.

Developments Working Against Security and Stability

24 As a result of the regional conflicts of the past decades the stability of some

parts of the immediate vicinity of our region still remains fragile, and in the
broader neighbourhood the possibility of a conventional conflicts still exists,
indeed, may even increase in certain regions, which may have indirect impact
also on Hungary.

25 The proliferation of chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear weapons of

mass destruction and their means of delivery – including dual use products
and the know-how necessary for their manufacturing – still constitutes an un­
predictable source of danger to international peace and security. The access
of hostile state and non-state actors to such weapons also appears as a dan­


-----

ger. The fact that access to high technology has become easier can further
increase the offensive capabilities of hostile state and non-state actors.

26 The activity of international terrorist groups with global ambitions has decreased

in the western world, nonetheless terrorism remains a significant global threat of
our time, since the causes, primarily social in nature, conducing to its appearance
and evolution have not been successfully eliminated. Thus terrorism still consti­
tutes a danger to the security and values of the Transatlantic Community and,
indirectly, Hungary.

27 A power shift of a global scale can be witnessed: emerging powers are acquir­

ing increasing economic and political influence. This process is not coupled
with a military challenge to the transatlantic region, however, the continuous
increase of the military budget of emerging powers may lead to a source of
tension in mid- and long-term.

28 The primarily economic and demographic changes occurring in the world are

leading to an increase in importance of certain regions outside Europe, and
thus Europe’s relative decrease in significance. This strengthens the demand
for reviewing current security structures.

29 The global financial and economic crisis might decrease the cohesion of the

EU. A significant decrease in the expenditure of European states on defence,
however, might have a negative impact on the transatlantic relations.

30 The stability of states and regions that have difficulties in or are incapable of

adapting to the challenges of globalisation is fragile and developments there
can take an unpredictable direction. That may strengthen the base of interna­
tional terrorism, and could become a source of risks arising from mass migra­
tion. States falling into anarchy or failed states can constitute a threat to the


-----

concerned region’s stability and may provide safe haven and training grounds
for terrorist groups with global ambitions.

31 The expected aggravation of economic, social and demographic problems

concerning states on the periphery may strengthen the position of extremists
and lead to an anti-western atmosphere.

32 The security and stability of individual regions are still primarily determined by

the policies of individual states, however, the role of non-state actors in shap­
ing the security environment is constantly growing. Our security therefore, is
increasingly influenced by actors outside international security structures not
directly controlled by politics.

33 Access to and use of global commons – the high seas, international airspace,

space and cyberspace – constitute new challenges and potential sources
of danger. The increasing number and potential damage caused by attacks
against computer networks is especially threatening. The characteristics of cy­
ber threats which are different from those of conventional threats necessitate a
comprehensive review and possible amendment of our concepts of war.

34 The impacts of the development of information society can be felt in all fields

of national and international security. Besides the numerous positive impacts,
the negative aspects of this development are also significant. Modern infocom­
munication tools used by state and non-state actors may contribute to creating
a security risk.

35 The issue of energy security constitutes an ever-increasing problem. The number

of import dependent consumers and the vulnerability of transport routes are
growing. A non-adequate diversification of energy sources is especially a char­

acteristic of our region. The global climate and environmental change, environ­
mental pollution, the impacts of increasingly extreme weather conditions, the


-----

depletion of raw materials and natural resources, access to drinking-water and
food problems of an increasing scale are expected to be the major sources or
amplifying factors of conflicts. We must also expect a growth in the number and
severity of natural and industrial disasters.

B) Allied Membership and International Conventions

36 Hungary’s NATO Membership constitutes collective responsibility and tasks

and also the possibility of collective action. The core tasks stemming from Al­
lied membership comprise of contribution to collective defence tasks and inter­
national operations, participation in maintaining and developing the capabilities
necessary for that and the strengthening of partnership relations.

37 Collective defence implemented according to Article 5 of the Washington Treaty

– the defence of both the country and its Allies – is one of the basic pillars of
the security of Hungary. The military tasks under the clauses of mutual assist­
ance and solidarity stipulated in the Treaty of Lisbon of the EU constitute further
tasks.

38 Participation in international operations is a diverse task to which we must be

able to contribute even in strategic distances. Hungary, based upon its concern­
ing level of ambition, is ready to and capable of stationing one thousand troops
in international operations at any given moment.

39 We must actively participate in international arms control and other confidence

and security building activities. We must contribute to the prevention of the pro­
liferation of conventional weapons and weapons of mass destruction and their
means of delivery.


-----

C) Characteristics of the Anticipated Employment of the Armed

Force

40 The armed force can be employed in the full spectrum of possible operation

from low to high intensity. Despite the fact that the Hungarian Defence Forces
participate in low intensity international operations today, in the mid-term they
must also be capable of being employed in high intensity operations.

41 The employment of the Hungarian Defence Forces generally occurs in crisis

management operations, in many cases significantly far from Hungary, under
extreme natural and climatic conditions, on terrain difficult to access with no
host nation support. During crisis management, the wide-scale application
of network centric warfare, intelligence and reconnaissance, precision guided
weapons and modern technical tools, civil-military cooperation, psychological
warfare and special operation forces become necessary. Crisis management
usually takes place in weak states incapable of performing their basic tasks
where security has to be established and maintained against irregular, paramili­
tary organisations, insurgents, armed groups and international mercenary and
terrorist groups.

42 Mass armies are replaced by smaller, flexibly employable armed forces com­

prised of highly trained soldiers. Instead of wide frontlines, fighting often takes
place in populated and built-in areas in the vicinity of civilian populations and
infrastructures, against an enemy difficult to identify.

43 The humanitarian intervention and assistance of the international community

with the use of military force can become necessary more often. Crises cannot
be managed by military force alone; their handling requires complex civilian
and military efforts and cooperation, with special regard to the mutual interde­
pendence of military and civilian experts operating in the same area of opera­
tion. Military and civilian efforts cannot be distinctly separated from each other.


-----

Not only state, but also non-state actors are present in a decisive manner in an
area of operation.

44 Exploiting the technological superiority available within the Alliance, any direct

physical contact between armed forces will usually be preceded by a strike
launched from outside the area with the use of unmanned devices in order to
break the expected resistance.

45 Ground manoeuvres of the armed forces are required for establishing direct

contact with the opposing party usually not organised in a regular way and its
civilian environment and also other actors participating in the crisis manage­
ment to support the achievement of the desired political objectives.

46 Supporting political objectives with military means requires the application of

various and occasionally all forms of military activities. Soldiers must in all cases
contribute to the achievement of the political objectives in the aforementioned
environment of multiple actors.

47 In international operations, the objective of the armed force is not only to establish

the security conditions necessary for rebuilding and repel the activities of armed
resistance, but as necessary, they must assume a role in the rebuilding until sta­
bility has been established. If civilian governmental and non-governmental or­
ganisations are also active in the area of operation, close cooperation with them
in the spirit of a comprehensive approach is an essential condition of success.

48 The employment of military force usually takes place in countries with a dif­

ferent culture, a fragmented society, underdeveloped infrastructure and state
organisation. The adequate preparation and training of the employed force for
the expected conditions is of great importance. During the preparation of the

soldiers special attention must be paid to make them familiar with the cultural
and political conditions of the region concerned.


-----

49 Due to changes in the global security environment, the role of intelligence and

counter-intelligence gains importance. The complex challenges that character­
ise the area of operation and the often changing security situation also increase
a demand for precise and timely information and analyses.

50 The high operational tempo and operational engagement characteristic of the

past decade is expected to decrease, but will still remain significant. Opera­
tional participation will demand quick decisions from decision makers.

51 Due to the quick information distributing capabilities of the mass media and

the internet, the time allocated to making decisions and the space to manoeu­
vre is constantly decreasing: certain governments are often forced to make
decisions on military interventions of a humanitarian purpose, or their termina­
tion, without thorough preparation, giving in to the pressure of public opinion.
Since society sets rather strict moral criteria regarding the way of executing
operations, it is expected of military forces to perform their task with great
precision, with the least possible civilian casualties and the lowest possible
losses. Operational activities can easily gain strategic or political significance
through the media. Due to that, commanders of the troops and each and every
soldier must perform their duties with the utmost caution during operational
activities.

52 The meaning of the concepts of war and attack have broadened, because

the emerging asymmetrical challenges non-lethal in nature, and not linked to
conventional weapons, are capable of inducing enormous material damage
and chaos. Depending on the damage caused, a non-armed attack may be
considered equal to an armed assault. Such threats are constituted primarily
by cyber-warfare whose potential in its capability of creating material damages
and obstructing public order is hardly less in significance than that of conven­

tional weapons.


-----

53 Technological development has brought about and made available new capa­

bilities and weapon systems, which transform the framework and character of
warfare as previously known.

D) Resources

54 The impact of the detrimental global economic environment that developed

since 2008 on the national economy and within that the central budget signifi­
cantly decreased the budgetary resources available to the Ministry of Defence.
This negative trend constitutes an even more significant challenge due to the
fact that national defence had been underfinanced in the previous period, too.

55 In order to stop and reverse the negative processes, the Government of Hungary

committed itself in a resolution that the budget of the Ministry of Defence for
the budgetary years of 2013-2015 will be provided at least at the nominal value
of the budgetary allocation for the year 2012, while from the budgetary year of
2016, with an annual increase of no less than 0.1 percent of the GDP, the total
budgetary allocation will reach 1.39% of the GDP by 2022, which is close to the
average of European NATO Member States.

56 In order to implement the Strategy and especially the objective targeting the

establishment of a sustainable military force, we must seek to ensure that a 4030-30% proportion of personnel, operation and maintenance, and procurement
costs be realised in the mid-term within the defence budget.

57 Beyond financial resources, the nature of the available human resources is of

critical importance in respect of the operation of the Hungarian Defence Forces.
The prepared, motivated and committed soldier performing a special public

service is the Hungarian Defence Forces’ greatest asset. His retention and ad­
equate supply is ensured by the implementation of the objectives stipulated in


-----

the human resources strategy of the Ministry and the systematic operation of
human resources subsystems.

58 Complex military challenges of our time can only be tackled by an armed force

whose personnel has received high-level education and training, has adequate
physical and psychological endurance, is capable of high-level performance in
an international environment, and is motivated and committed to executing its
tasks. For that, secondary and tertiary education, courses, training and drills
preparing for the successful implementation of tasks and fulfilling the require­
ments of our age and an adequate selection system for the selection of leaders
are required. The transforming officers’ training focusing on leadership capabil­
ity and the aligned training of non-commissioned officers must establish the
conditions for the convertibility between public service careers.

59 Resulting from Hungary’s NATO and EU membership, an increasing number of

Hungarian Defence Forces personnel possess significant international experi­
ence. Building on the knowledge and experience gained in an international en­
vironment is of fundamental importance in the modernisation of the Hungarian
Defence Forces.

60 The development of the voluntary reserve system contributes to the increase of

the military capabilities of the Hungarian Defence Forces and the strengthening
of patriotism. The reserve system must be capable of attracting from the labour
market the skilled, committed, motivated fellow countrymen who want to ready
to serve their country and retaining them in the voluntary reserve force of the
Hungarian Defence Forces.


-----

IV. Tasks of the Hungarian Defence Forces

61 The core task of the Hungarian Defence Forces is the armed defence of Hunga­

ry’s independence, territory, airspace, population and material goods against any
external attack either individually or in an Allied framework. That requires identify­
ing the military threats directly or indirectly affecting Hungary, the development of
an adequate deterring capability and, if necessary, to avert military threats.

62 An important task of the Hungarian Defence Forces in connection with perform­

ing their core task is organising and providing host nation support for Allied
forces. Their further task is to prevent civilian aircraft from being applied as
renegades.

63 Due to its membership in the UN, NATO, the EU and the Organisation for Secu­

rity and Cooperation in Europe (hereinafter referred to as OSCE), it is Hungary’s
responsibility to fulfil its allied and other international obligations, especially col­
lective defence, crisis management, humanitarian and confidence and secu­
rity building tasks, where a decisive role is placed on the Hungarian Defence
Forces. Fulfilling international obligations contributes to the strengthening of
international peace and security and, consequently, Hungary’s security, increas­
ing the international prestige of the country at the same time.

64 The Hungarian Defence Forces contribute to countering natural and industrial

disasters, mitigating their consequences, managing humanitarian crises and, if
necessary, and participating in the support of civilian authorities. They perform
explosive ordnance disposal and other tasks requiring military expertise and
special equipment as well as guard and protect designated critical infrastruc­
ture facilities.

65 Beyond that, the Hungarian Defence Forces maintain international military rela­

tions, guard and protect the Holy Crown, participate in protocol tasks, including


-----

guarding the Presidential Palace, contribute to safeguarding military traditions
and partake in the tasks of state provisioning and public employment.

66 Pursuing their tasks the Hungarian Defence Forces prepare for wartime, crisis

management and peacetime activities.

V. Capabilities

67 The Hungarian Defence Forces must become a sustainable, well organised

military force meeting modern requirements, modernized in its approach and
defence technology, respecting and safeguarding national traditions, efficiently
employable either independently or within the Allied framework and reinforced
with a reserve system. In order to execute their domestic and international
tasks, they must have well equipped and trained personnel with operational
and combat experience as well as possess flexible, efficiently applicable, de­
ployable and sustainable capabilities that enable the defence of the territory
and sovereignty of Hungary, contribute to collective defence of the Alliance and
to operations stemming from our NATO, EU, UN and OSCE membership and
other bilateral or multilateral treaties.

A) Fundamental Aspects of Capability Development

68 The development and operational principles of the Hungarian Defence Forces

must be determined with a view to fulfilling the tasks and responsibilities set
forth in the Fundamental Law and those deriving from international obligations,
in consideration of the operational environment and harmonised with our Allies.

69 The Hungarian Defence Forces must become a capability based armed force

that is capable of efficient cooperation with our Allies and whose organisation


-----

includes all combat elements and capabilities necessary for the armed de­
fence of the country at least at a basic level.

70 In case of possible deterioration of the security environment, in light of our Al­

lied membership we must be able to improve the basic capabilities necessary
for the armed defence of the country by making use of the resources of the
national economy.

71 The capability development of the Hungarian Armed Forces must be planned

and implemented within the framework of the Ministry’s Defence Planning Sys­
tem, in line with NATO’s defence planning cycle and the EU’s capability develop­
ment process.

B) Capability Development Guidelines

72 As a result of mid- and long-term capability development, in consideration of

available resources, the armed force must:

a) be able to defend the country within the framework of NATO’s collective de­

fence and depending on the magnitude of the aggression be capable of the
armed defence of the country until the arrival of Allied forces;

b) be capable of performing the military tasks of the host nation support of Al­

lied forces;

c) contribute to the collective defence of the Alliance according to Hungary’s

commitments;

d) contribute to the EU’s crisis management and capability development activi­

ties within the framework of CSDP;

e) be capable of participating in the full spectrum of operations from low inten­

sity stabilisation operations to high intensity combat operations;


-----

f) be capable of participating in countering natural and industrial disasters and

mitigating their consequences by maintaining and developing capabilities
connected to disaster management;

g) be capable of cooperating with civilian authorities and organisations, gov­

ernmental and non-governmental organisations and international organisa­
tions engaged in operations both in a domestic and an international environ­
ment;

h) actively participate in NATO’s transformation activities and adopt their re­

sults;

i) draw, share and utilise the lessons learned during preparation, training and

employment.

73 Responsiveness, flexibility, survivability and interoperability must be the most

important characteristics of the armed force in order to successfully handle
challenges. For the successful implementation of both the collective defence
responsibilities and the participation in international operations, the usability
– deployability and sustainability – of the Hungarian Defence Forces must be
strengthened in the full spectrum of operations.

74 The armed defence of the country requires that the Hungarian Defence Forces

be in possession of the cores of branches cut back during previous reorganisa­
tions that are of critical importance from the aspect of performing the task.

75 The Hungarian Defence Forces maintain army and air force and within those

combat, combat support and combat service support elements as well as or­
ganisations performing other professional activities. The capabilities and or­
ganisations must be operated jointly, so the Hungarian Armed Forces are ca­
pable of performing operations at a joint forces level both individually, and in
cooperation with Allied forces.


-----

76 The voluntary reserve system is an integral part of the Hungarian Defence Forc­

es, which relieves and supplements the active component of the armed force
in peacetime by performing the tasks determined by legal regulations.

77 The efficient activity of the Military National Security Service is highly required

for predicting crises and obtaining, analysing and evaluating information nec­
essary for military operations as well as for ensuring the safety of soldiers de­
ployed in crisis regions. During performing its tasks, the Service must be able
to cooperate with the bodies of the Ministry of Defence and the Hungarian De­
fence Forces, domestic partner services, the intelligence and counter-intelli­
gence units of NATO and the EU and, based upon the principle of mutuality,
with foreign national security services.

78 During national security activities an emphasis must be laid on the develop­

ment of information collection and evaluating devices and methods, the ap­
plication of new, innovative procedures and the utilisation of the latest research
results and lessons learned in intelligence and counter-intelligence work.

79 The capability of national immediate and rapid response to unpredicted and

unexpected events must be further strengthened. At NATO and EU level the
NATO Response Force and the EU Battle Groups are important tools for
that.

80 The essential conditions for the efficient operation of the Hungarian Defence

Forces comprise a stable but flexible organisation and operational leadership,
the ability of units and subunits to act autonomously as well as the integrability
and modularity of organisational elements.

81 The Hungarian Armed Forces must be capable of participating in the full spec­

trum of operations. As part of that, they must be able to cooperate and maintain
relations with international governmental and non-governmental organisations


-----

and local authorities and population. They must have the capabilities for per­
forming training and mentoring tasks in the area of operation.

82 One of the objectives of the Hungarian Defence Forces is to create the condi­

tions for network centric warfare. As part of that the cyber defence of the Hun­
garian Defence Forces must be reinforced, which requires the development of
conceptually grounded regulations, the acquisition of modern devices and the
adequate preparation and training of personnel.

83 The increasing role of the mass media in forming public opinion requires the de­

velopment of the communication capabilities of the Hungarian Defence Forces.

C) Implementation Guidelines

84 The solid political commitment to the development of the Hungarian Armed

Forces is accompanied by an increase in available financial resources only in
the mid-term. In order to alleviate the difficulties deriving from that, the increase
of efficiency is of key significance. As a part of that a precise definition of priori­
ties, a close cooperation between organisations, less bureaucracy, task based
planning, consistent, yet appropriately flexible implementation, responsiveness
to novelty and an innovative approach are needed.

85 The limited financial resources only allow a gradual advance in the implemen­

tation of our capability development objectives. The scarcity of resources de­
mands scheduled and prioritised implementation of developments.

86 The efficient application of the available human resources, the targeted utilisa­

tion of personnel, the correction of rank and staff proportions, the rationalisa­

tion of the military structure and the appropriate organisational structure, the
rationalisation of procurement of defence technology and other acquisitions,


-----

the maintenance of combat readiness of defence equipment and the utilisation
of opportunities in multinational cooperation are requisite.

87 The development related to defence equipment must be planned based upon

available resources with their targeted utilisation. In capability development we
must increasingly rely upon NATO, EU, regional and bilateral programmes. Spe­
cial attention is to be paid to exploring and exploiting the opportunities lying in
the national economy and domestic defence industry.

88 Strengthening the cooperation between NATO and the EU and the elimination

of unnecessary duplications are of great significance to Hungary. NATO and
EU membership enable Hungary to build capabilities in cooperation with its
Allies and partners and in harmony with its own domestic capacity building
priorities that the country could not procure or maintain on its own and that are
also absent in the international domain. Keeping cost efficiency in mind, the
opportunities lying in the development and sharing of defence capabilities in
