# Foreword

![2_Image_1.Png](2_Image_1.Png)

Papua New Guinea (PNG) is the 'land of a thousand tribes'. There is

![2_image_0.png](2_image_0.png)

great beauty and strength in our diversity. We acknowledge our forefathers who have gone before us and forged the path along which we travel, and it is now the responsibility of our generation and those to come after us, to protect that which is so dear to us; our lives, our land, our diverse cultures, our resources and our relationship with God.

Many nations around the world have gone to war to acquire and protect what is theirs.

They understand the inextricable link between development and security.   We did not have to fight for Independence, as it was granted to us in good faith. We have,

![2_image_2.png](2_image_2.png)

therefore, tended to focus on development at the expense of security, such that the security gaps of today are seriously undermining our development efforts. The current security environment is directly affecting our people. It is, therefore, time for us to tie development and security and apportion them equal attention. We must do this for the sake of the well-being of our people and prosperity of our nation.

Since Independence, our national security has lacked effective co-ordination. The manner in which we have managed our security has either been reactionary or disjointed. It is imperative that we improve on our security coordination mechanisms to ensure delivery of effective security to our people.

Additionally, our national security institutions have been neglected to the extent where they lack appropriate capabilities to provide effective public safety and protection of our natural resources and our international borders.

Law and order remains one of our biggest challenges and my Government is committed to addressing this malaise. This will be achieved through support to the Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary's (RPNGC's) Modernisation programme and similar programmes within the Law and Justice sector.

The National Security Policy becomes the veritable instrument through which such security sector programmes can be achieved. It will not impede the key functions and responsibilities of individual agencies but rather provide the platform upon which national security can be better co-ordinated nationwide.

![2_image_3.png](2_image_3.png)

National security is a key Government task; however it is also every citizen's responsibility. In order to overcome the enormous security challenges that confronts us as a nation, we must change our mindset and attitudes by taking on the responsibility of security at all levels and across all sectors.

Security is inexorably linked to PNG's survival as a developing country. In this regard I
entreat all my fellow citizens to embrace this policy to help build a safe, secure and prosperous PNG.

| am very delighted to inform the people, international business community and development partners, and all other stakeholders that the Government is fully committed to improving the security of PNG.

We live in a globalized world of increasing interdependence and high mobility of people, resources and capital across borders. Głobał business is well established in our nation and information connectivity has generated a wide range of complex, non-traditional security challenges that have permeated all levels of our society. Our land, air and maritime borders including PNG citizens in diplomatic, consular and UN peacekeeping posts, have become increasingly vulnerable to the security challenges of a globalized world.

Our natural resources are being illegally plundered at an alarming rate and the illegal smuggling of small arms, light weapons and contraband, continue unabated. Law and order transgressions, violence against women, children and the most vulnerable people, corruption, transnational crime and the emerging challenges of human security and cyber-crime, are serious threats to our national security. Our nation is at the verge of major socio-economic development with the rollout of the LNG Project in 2014. Protecting the over 700 kilometres of gas pipeline and the sea lanes through which our major international customers will transport the product, also present new strategic security challenges. In the last 38 years, PNG did not have a National Security Policy.  In 2011 the National Security Council (NSC) directed the Office of Security Coordination and Assessment
(OSCA) in the Department of Prime Minister & NEC to spearhead the formulation of a National Security Policy (NSP) to be strongly aligned to Pillar 4 of Vision 2050 on
'Security and International Relations'. NSC also directed that the policy must be fully cognizant of other PNG development frameworks such as the DSP 2010-2030 and MTDP 2011-2015.

This National Security Policy will provide a strategic policy framework for security oversight, coordination, alignment and guidance for all key security sector agencies, all Government Departments and Agencies, Private Sector and Civil Society Organisations. They will be required to align their policies thus ensuring that scarce resources allocated to improving our National Security are spent in a coordinated, realistic, cost-effective and accountable manner.

P
I therefore appeal to all citizens to take ownership of our National Security Policy and contribute to its implementation as security is everyone's responsibility.

At this juncture, I would like to acknowledge and commend the invaluable contributions to the development of this important policy through comments, suggestions and other inputs by stakeholders in the private and public sector at all levels, as well as by international business community and development partners, civil society organisations and other concerned individuals. It is noteworthy to extend our sincere thanks and appreciation to the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) for providing technical assistance to this all important project.

Finally, I would like to extend my sincere gratitude to all those who were involved in the formulation of this policy.

## Executive Summary

The strategic decision of the Government was to develop a National Security Policy
(NSP) strongly aligned to the Constitution and Pillar No. 4 of the PNG Vision 2050. This policy is meant to assist Government decision-making and actions to address the numerous security threats currently face by the country. The NSP was developed in line with the international standard and best practices. The formulation process was inclusive and participatory involving a series of consultations held with all stakeholders nationwide.

The focus of the NSP is the People. Chapter 1 seeks to define national security so that users of the policy have a common understanding of what the issue is and to put the NSP into perspective. The purpose of the policy is also articulated here.  The chapter gives emphasis to people-centred security and clearly outlines PNG's core values and strategic interests. It further elaborates on the link between development and security.

Chapter 2 puts the Independent State of Papua New Guinea into context. It focuses on

| In Chapter 3 the policy focuses on the Strategic Security Environment. It puts into      |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| perspective global and national security concerns. It outlines PNG's commitment to       |
| wider global and regional security. It is largely based on the Political Economic Social |
| Technology Environment and Legal (PESTEL) Environmental Scan (Escan) Model               |
| conducted for PNG.                                                                       |

the profile which encompasses geographical positioning, its political arrangements, social-economic development, and introduces the core security providers of the state.

Chapter 4 ranks PNG's threats into two levels to assist Government to adequately respond to threats that are immediate and most serious while preparing for those that are less immediate or slowly evolving.

The NSP needs institutional drivers as directed in Pillar No.4 of PNG Vision 2050.

Chapter 5 addresses Institutional Policy Frameworks and Gaps. It takes into account the management and legal frameworks, including the regulation of private security companies, public and private partnership arrangements, threat mitigation processes, and key capabilities and limitations. In essence it provides a Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats (SWOT) analysis of the key stakeholder institutions and agencies.

![6_image_1.png](6_image_1.png)

vi

![6_image_0.png](6_image_0.png)

Chapter 6 provides the way forward through setting Policy Goals and Implementation Strategies based on several cross-cutting security issues associated with the PESTEL
model.

Chapter 7 addresses Monitoring and Evaluation mechanisms with emphasis to human rights, rule of faw, and gender mainstreaming - all of which strengthen the peoplecentred security thrust of the NSP. This Chapter includes mechanisms for national security co-ordination and parliamentary oversight.

A list of acronyms and abbreviations is appended as Annexure A.

Appended as Annexure B is a list of all key Security Institutions.

The implementation plan of the NSP is captured in its Strategic Action Plan that covers, among others, the processes and Key Performance Indicators and Verification methods for various Departments and Agencies that will be involved in the implementation of this policy.

The NSP SAP is a separate document but must be read together with the NSP. The NSP SAP is a restricted document and remains the property of the Independent State of Papua New Guinea.

## Chapter 1 Introduction Purpose 1.1 Definition Of Png National Security The Png Constitution 1.2 The Five National Goals And Directive Principles 1.3

Papua New Guinea's (PNGs) security is critical to its existence as a nation. Security cannot be separated from all the other development aspirations. It affects the development and prosperity of our citizens and our progress and survival as a nation. A National Security Policy is needed now more than ever before, because there has been a lack of an overarching policy framework that would ensure an effective and co-ordinated approach towards addressing this very important issue. The NSP provides a whole-of-nation approach to address and strengthen national security.

It is, tr cohesic From  ε that all allegian cleavag aspirati‹
times ta National Security is the protection of our citizens, national sovereignty, democratic rights, freedoms and values, strategic assets and resources, and the well-being and prosperity of our nation, and our people.

Nationa linked tr 2011 -
becaus‹
internati The Constitution of the Independent State of PNG clearly spells out in the opening statement of the Preamble that the desire is for PNG to be united as one nation.

In the opening lines, the Constitution declares: "AND WE ASSERT….that we guard with our lives our national identity, integrity and self-respect…"
1.5 The PN
citizens this reg:
Furthermore, the Independent State of PNG was founded on five fundamental national goals and principles, which form the core platform of our nationhood and they are as follows:
That every person  be dynamically involved in the process of freeing himself o or herself from every form of domination or oppression so that each man, or woman will have the opportunity to develop as a whole person in relationship with others.

·  That all citizens to have an equal opportunity to participate in, and benefit from, the development of our country.

›n in relationship > in, and benefit

![10_image_0.png](10_image_0.png)

That Papua New Guinea be politically and economically independent, and our economy basically self-reliant. That PNG's natural resources and environment be conserved and used for the collective benefit of us all, and be replenished for the benefit of future generations.

o That development be achieved primarily through the use of PNG forms of social, political and economic organization.

It is, therefore, incumbent on all citizens to ensure that the social and national cohesion required by the Constitution is upheld.

From a national security standpoint, much work needs to be done in making sure that all citizens act and think as one nation. Citizens must now choose to owe their allegiance to the state rather than to their lineages associated with their social cleavages such as tribes, clans and villages. It is key that in furtherance of all PNG's aspirations of political and socio-economic advancement, all citizens must at all times take full cognizance of the need to maintain the unity of the country.

## Strategic Development Aspirations 1.4

National Security is inextricably linked with development. Mindful of this, the NSP is linked to the Constitution, the PNG Vision 2050, the PNG DSP 2010-2030, MTDP
2011 - 2015, the Defence White Paper and the Foreign Policy. This is necessary because national security encompasses cross-cutting issues in domestic and international spheres.

## 1.5 Basic Social Obligations

The PNG Constitution identifies the under-mentioned basic social obligations for all citizens in pursuance of our country's development and the people's well-being. In this regard citizens are expected to:
.

Respect, and to act in the spirit of, the Constitution.

�
Recognize that they can fully develop their capabilities and advance their true interests only by active participation in the development of the national community as a whole;
•
Exercise the rights guaranteed or conferred by the Constitution, and to use the opportunities made available to them under it to participate fully in the governance of the nation; 2

## Christian Values 1.6

PNG is founded on firm Christian principles and values as enshrined in the Constitution:
It asserts that we; " ...Pledge ourselves to guard and pass on to those who come after us our noble traditions and the Christian principles that are ours now"
(Constitution).

In this regard, our nation at Independence declared and placed under the guiding hand of God.

## People-Centred Security 1.7

The people are the focus of this policy. As such, PNG has joined a growing number of countries who recognize that since the legitimacy of a state depends on the mandate accorded by its citizens, their security and that of non-citizens should be of paramount importance. This emphasises the paradigm shift from 'state-centric' to a
'people-centred' security.

Militarily strong states that focused on state-centric security did not necessarily deliver human security. In many occasions this has resulted in intra-state wars, internal conflicts and fragmentation. This further weakened the states' ability to 3

|                | The separation of development and security policy imperatives was starkly evident        |
|                | during the Cold War.  The ideological differences that polarised global politics during  |
|                | much of the 1950s and into the 1970s inevitably caused many countries around the         |
|                | world to perceive and address security in terms of threats from beyond one's own         |
|                | political boundaries rather than from within. Therefore, security considerations were    |
|                | largely state-centric.                                                                   |
|                | Meanwhile policies aimed at development and modernisation were greatly influenced        |
|                | by dominant economic theories of the day which stated that good or healthy               |
|                | economic growth would lead to a trickling down effect of the wealth generated to all     |
|                | strata of society.  This was a process that was to encompass all capitalist countries -  |
|                | regardless of their development statuses ~ which were expected to go through             |
|                | different stages of modernisation to a high esteemed level.  However, it became          |
|                | apparent that many of them were yielding less impressive economic results. A new         |
|                | line of thinking therefore necessitated the need to revisit and redefine 'development'   |
|                | and 'security' with a view to synergize what they each represented.                      |
|                |                                                                                          |
|                | This shift reinforces the general acceptance that 'security enhances development         |
|                | whilst development entails comprehensive security'. "Development" covers                 |
|                | psychological and material well-being of people while "security" covers broader          |
|                | concerns, including economic and social issues such as welfare, employment and           |
|                | re-distribution of wealth. Hence, security and development are interdependent. Both      |
|                |                                                                                          |

![12_image_1.png](12_image_1.png)

are reliant on the 'respect for human rights' and 'rule of law' to create a peaceful environment that can ensure prosperity and enhance the 'freedom from fear and freedom of want'.

PNG faces its unique challenge of linking security and development, hence, this policy is aimed at addressing this fundamental gap.

## 1.9 National Security Policy Framework

The NSP provides a comprehensive framework on cross-cutting security issues that are of strategic importance to the country and people. The policy offers strategies to preserve our core values and safeguard our national interests.  It identifies threats to the state and outlines mitigating strategies as well as determining courses of action. All of these will be achieved by adopting a whole-of-nation approach to security.

The NSP addresses real and potential threats that undermine the security of our country and our people. It is intended to improve on national security coordination and enhance early warning and early response systems.

# Chapter 2 Papua New Guinea In Context

## 2.1 The Geography

PNG is predominantly a Melanesian Island state situated in the south western part of the Pacific Ocean, directly north of Australia.  It has a total area of 462 840 km² of which, 452 860 km² comprise of islands and 9 980 km² is water which includes lakes, rivers, reservoirs, etc. Its coastline is 5,152 km long. Offshore islands to the north and east are the islands of New Britain, New Ireland, and Bougainville.  To the north are small forested Admiralty Islands, the largest of which is Manus.

We share a 765 km land border with the Republic of Indonesia to the west, and sea borders with Australia, Solomon Islands to the south and south-east respectively while Federated States of Micronesia in the north.

Our country is the largest island state in the Pacific (apart from Australia and New Zealand), by land mass (about 460, 000 km²), and in terms of population, 7.5 million people. Much of the land is made up of tropical rainforests, making up 1/6th of the total forested areas of the world, whilst providing a habitat for some of the world's most exotic species of flora and fauna. The country's topography also endows it with huge agricultural and marine potential, whilst it's mineral, oil and gas sectors are in a boom as a result of on-going discoveries and resource development. There are several active volcanoes as PNG sits along the Pacific Ring of Fire, Several volcanoes are active and the country is prone to earthquakes and tsunamis. The mountainous regions are most susceptible to landslides which are often caused by tectonic plate movements and deforestation resulting from human activities. Although English is the official language, PNG also has 800 plus other traditional languages which make it a country of diverse cultures. This in*fact makes PNG a
'state of many nations', resulting in a whole host of security issues that hamper national development. After 38 years of independence, PNG remains an underdeveloped country.

## 2.2 Political Status

PNG is a constitutional parliamentary democracy modelled on the British Westminster system. Queen Elizabeth II is the Head of State and is represented by the Governor General, who performs mainly ceremonial functions.

The National, Provincial and the Local Level Government constitute PNG's three (3)
levels of Government with members of Parliament elected for a five-year term and the Prime Minister is appointed and dismissed by the Governor-General on the advice of the Parliament.

The three Government machineries; Parliamentary, Executive and Judiciary operate with separate application of jurisdictional powers. The country's domestic political environment along with the challenges of our socio-economic sector can have an immense effect on our National Security.

## 2.3 Socio-Economic Development

PNG is a signatory to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) which are underpinned by economic, social and cultural rights. The MDG targets and indicators are holistic and outcome-based with respect to service delivery. All MDG goals are incorporated into the PNG Government development plans and are noted as moral and constitutional obligations for the government in all sectoral responsibilities.

According to the Human Development Report of 2013, PNG is rated 56 out of the 187 countries. With a total population of 7.5 million people and a growth rate of 2.83 percent, it is considered a worrisome trend having medium to long term impact on socio-economic security. Additionally, urbanization, land use, education enrolment and retention rates, the youth bulge, rural-urban migration, and HIV/AIDs are exerting enormous pressures on the state's ability to respond accordingly.

Meanwhile external pressures on PNG's cultures and traditions, gender based violence, child protection and youth development comes with further social risks that the nation must deal with.

PNG has a dual economy comprising a formal, corporate-based sector and a large informal sector where subsistence farming accounts for the bulk of the economic activity. Migration in the past decade has also contributed to urban unemployment and social problems. If this trend continues it will have a huge impact on public resources. The formal sector provides a narrow employment base, consisting of workers engaged in mineral production, a relatively small manufacturing sector, public sector employees and service industries including finance, construction, transportation and utilities. The majority of the population is engaged in the informal sector. The Government is now focusing on the development of the Small to Medium Enterprises to ensure our people are given all the opportunity to meaningfully participate in gainful economic activities.

The country continues to generate its income through major cash crops such as copra, coffee, palm oil and cocoa. The boom in the oil and gas sector, fisheries, tourism and timber has also raised revenues for the country.

Real GDP was projected to grow at 7.5 per cent in 2012. GDP growth is supported by recovery in mining output and construction activity connected with the PNG LNG
project. Inflationary pressures continue, although monetary tightening in 2011 slowed inflation to an annual rate of 7 per cent growth rate. Risks to the economy include the possibility of resources curse impacts from LNG and mineral sector growth, and the 8 disruj The (

disruption to the economy should major resource projects not proceed as expected.

The country remains vulnerable to global prices for gold, copper and oil. It continues to encounter challenges in its institutional and sectoral planning, governance, coordination, monitoring and programming among and within different sectors.

These weak linkages are due to poor governance as reflected in PNG's low rating in the United Nation's Human Development Index (UNHDI).

Other critical security issues include; lack of support to small business development; ineffective interventions on law and order issues; increase in the rate of gender based violence; food security concerns as a result of poor agricultural extension and technical services and limited focus on the cross cutting issues including HIV/AIDS. These issues can undermine the country's national security and development if effective interventions are not undertaken.

## 2. 4 Security Institutions

PNG security institutions are mandated by legislations and policy frameworks to provide security for the state and the people. Since independence these tasks have been performed exceptionally well. However, these institutions continue to grapple with the challenges of resource constraints and working together in a coordinated manner.

## 2.4.1 The Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary

The RPNGC was established under Section 188 of the Constitution. Under section 196 of the Constitution, the Police Force comes under the control of the National Executive Council (NEC) through a Minister.

Its functions under section 197 are:
a To preserve peace and good order in the country; and,
:
To maintain and, as necessary, enforce the law in an impartial and objective manner.

The Police Force is therefore a key partner in the implementation of this whole-ofnation approach as articulated in the NSP.

9

![18_image_1.png](18_image_1.png)

## 2.4.2 Defence Organisation

The PNG Defence Force (PNGDF) and the Department of Defence (DOD) were both established under Section 188 of the Constitution and the Defence Act of 1974. The Ministry of Defence, the PNGDF and the DOD all constitute the PNG Defence Organisation (PNGDO).

Section 202 of the constitution describes the functions of the PNGDF and Section 5 of the Defence Act along with the Public Services Management Act of 1986, describe the functions of the DOD. To reflect these functions, Defence Policy is therefore geared toward the following:
.

Defending PNG. The Defence of PNG's sovereignty and the integrity of its land, air and maritime borders, is the primary focus of the PNGDO.

.

Civil Emergency assistance provided to the civilian authorities during national emergencies and restoration of public order and security.

 в Nation Building. Without degrading its primary role of Defending PNG, the PNGDO provides a significant contribution in nation building.

.

International Obligations. Through the foreign policy framework that guides engagements with international partners, the PNGDO contributes to regional stability as well as global peace and good order.

The defence white paper subscribes to the NSP, and therefore aims to strengthen The national security by contributing to the whole-of-nation security approach.

PNGDO also endeavours to build capability that contributes to PNG being the 'First Responders' to man-made or natural calamities that affect our people and interests.

## Department Of Foreign Affairs 2.4.3

The conduct of PNG's international relations is guided by its foreign policy directives set by successive governments since independence. It is also underpinned by its commitments and obligations to international treaties and protocols provided under the Vienna Convention on the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations, Privileges and Immunities. Since Independence, PNG adopted the following Foreign Policy directions and Ministerial statements described as:
Universalism - Friends to All and Enemies to None (1975)

The PNG Foreign Policy provides a broad international policy framework that guides the country's conduct in international relations.   However, since 2003, no serious attempt has been made to revise our foreign policy to adapt to changing circumstances and developments both globally and domestically. To bridge this gap, a revised Foreign Policy will focus on economic growth and national security. It will be aligned to the PNG Vision 2050, the Development Strategic Plan (2010-2030)
and the MTDP (2011-2015). With the theme "In pursuit of our National Vision and Objectives through Strategic and International Relationships 2011-2030," this Foreign Policy demands that our country be pragmatic and result-oriented through strategic international engagement.

The Foreign Policy reiterates the Department of Foreign Affairs as one of the key security providers since it commits the Department to foster national security for the collective benefit of our country and the people.

## 2.4.4 Png Correctional Services

The PNG Correctional Service (CS) Act of 1995 established the PNG Correctional Service and declared it as a State Service under Section 188(2) of the Constitution.

The legislation provides for the functions and powers of the CS and declared Correctional Officers as 'Members of the Disciplined Force" under Section 207 of the Constitution.

The core functions and roles of CS are to take custody of all persons committed and sentenced to Correctional Institutions with proper security provisions as well as offering them efficient and humane facilities so that they are incarcerated away from the society.  This is part and parcel of their education, training and rehabilitation to transform them into better citizens.

The Correctional Service Strategic Plan is a significant guide to reshape the CS and conform it to International best practices.

11

The CS will continue to collaborate with other government agencies and relevant stakeholders such as the National Security Agencies, Law and Justice Sector, Provincial Governments, the Agricultural Sector, the Social Sector, Civil Society, Churches and Non-Government Organizations to achieve its objects.

The PNG Correctional Services (CS) has been plagued with serious problems relating to mass break-outs of prisoners, ineffective prisoner-rehabilitation programmes and serious cases of indiscipline. Immediate and necessary steps must be taken to address this malaise.

## 2.4.5 National Intelligence Organisation

The National Intelligence Organisation's (NIO) roles and functions are defined by its Act of 1984. They are to collect, collate, analyse and provide accurate intelligence to the Government   on matters affecting the national security of the country. PNG is vulnerable to a number of major internal and external security threats.  The NIO needs to ensure that the Government is regularly updated so that appropriate security steps are taken to address them. This organisation needs the serious attention of Government for it to be able to cope with emerging diverse national, regional and global security challenges.

## 2.4.6 Png Customs Service

The PNG Customs Service is mandated by the Customs Act 1951 to control, supervise and authorise all forms of conveyances, persons and cargo that move across our borders. It also has jurisdiction under the Customs and Excise Tariff Acts to charge and collect duties and taxes.

The agency performs three key functions, which are border and community protection, trade facilitation and revenue collection.

In order to enhance its role, the PNG Customs Service has to align its functional roles and responsibilities with the NSP.

## 2.4.7 The Office Of Security Coordination And Assessment (Osca)

The Office of Security Coordination and Assessment (OSCA) was established in 1991 through the NEC Decision No: 104/91 amended in 1994. Its primary 12

ENVIRONMENT

# Chapter 3

## Papua New Guinea'S Strategic Security Environment

Papua New Guinea's security environment is influenced by both external and internal factors.

## External Security Environment Part I

PNG's security is inextricably linked to regional and the wider global security environment. In today's interconnected world, whatever happens on one side of the world will invariably impact us. It makes sense to take note of the security environment in the world when designing our own national security policy and strategies. In the end our security interests must compliment the security strategies of our friends as we move together to build a safer and secure global environment.

## 3.1 Global Security Concerns

The last two decades has seen quantum shifts in the nature of threats to global security. The end of the cold war removed the familiar and predictable division of the "
world into two spheres of influence based on differing and clearly defined ideologies.

Though the immediate threat of nuclear war between the two superpowers ended, it created a platform for nuclear arms race between smaller powers.

New challenges such as terrorism, transnational crimes, nuclear proliferation, cyberattacks, global warming and microbial menaces have created an entirely new" security environment demanding new approaches and strategies towards mitigating)
them.

Evolving threats require robust, dynamic and multi-faceted mitigation strategies, which must be adaptable to a variety of scenarios.  Military aggression still remains a substantial global threat.

## 3.2 Commitment To Global Security

As a member of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), PNG remains neutral in any global or regional power dynamics. Additionally, as a member of the United Nations
(UN) and signatory to various international treaties, conventions and protocols, wes remain committed to global peace and security.

These are necessary requisites for promoting national security interests and development. The possibility of PNG being invaded militarily by any foreign power is remote. However, all efforts will be made to ensure that appropriate military capabilities are developed to deter potential aggressors and defend and uphold our sovereignty and territorial integrity.

Co-operative global security initiatives and arrangements are important and require collective responses by member states in promoting the UN global agenda on peace and security, PNG will continue to participate meaningfully in all areas including

## Geo-Politics In The Asia-Pacific Region

Our geographical location naturally affords us immense stock of geo-political, defence and strategic value. The experience of World War II and PNG's innocent thrust into the conflict and the price paid is a clear manifestation of this reality. Our maritime territory gives us commanding reach to strategic sea-lanes from which international commerce takes place including the movement of strategic cargoes.

| In these sea lanes, illegal, irregular and illicit trans-boundary movement of people,   |

capital and contrabands also move around between countries, with PNG often targeted as a destination.

| conflict resolution, restoration and confidence-building measures.   |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------|

unique challenges that impact on PNG's security.  Our rich endowment of natural resources and the subsequent attraction of multinational enterprises increase PNG's geo-political and economic value.

In terms of geo-strategy and security, PNG has a strong relationship with the United States.

At this time when states within the Asia-Pacific Rim (Rim countries) are intensely competing economically whilst simultaneously jockeying to buttress themselves

![26_image_0.png](26_image_0.png)

16

![26_image_1.png](26_image_1.png)

against China's rise to superpower status, as well as the rising nuclear threat posed by North Korea, areas of tensions are likely to show.

These trends necessitate convergence and inter-dependencies, compromise, greater understanding, co-operation and partnership among nations. Territorial sea disputes in the East and South China Seas are realities. India's growing military prowess and the US military rebalancing in the region requires a strategic understanding of these emerging scenarios.

The democratization of Indonesia and elsewhere in South East Asia requires PNG to rethink its geo-strategic and economic status more seriously now than ever, Australia's military exit from Afghanistan (Coalition of the willing) and Solomon Islands (RAMSI) will warrant constructive dialogue to pursue our mutual strategic interest for continued peace and security in the region.

PNG-Australia new Defence Corporation Arrangement (DCA) is a marked graduation from the Joint Declaration of Principles (JDP) and the Defence Co-operation Programme (DCP). This arrangement has been endorsed and is currently being implemented.

The 2013 UN Human Development Report (UN-HDR) propounds the phenomenal
"Rise of the South" to include Brazil, India, China and Indonesia with the exception of Russia. This changing global scenario, driven largely by an economic power grid is occurring directly within PNG's regional proximity and involves its bilateral trading partners. This may have significant impact in our trade and economic relations. In short, the Asia-Pacific region is of great geo-political, defence and strategic value to PNG. This needs to be further consolidated by identifying new opportunities and developing them into constructive relationships that will enhance our country's National Security.

## 3.2.2 The Emerging Indo-Pacific System

The Indo-Pacific concept emphasises pre-eminence of regional maritime-based security system geared toward protection of sea lanes in the Indian and Pacific Ocean.

PNG will continue to demonstrate its significance and integrity as an independent sovereign state located within the Indo-Pacific Construct.

This is demonstrated by our various bilateral and multilateral arrangements with countries within the region.

## The Global Economy 3,2.3

The global economy promises increase in PNG's Gross National Product (GNP).

This could be achieved on terms which benefit the people. Therefore, an increasing GNP must become an opportunity and a reality. We need to recognize what benefits and challenges the global economy has brought to other countries.

The global recession of 2009 was a major economic decline beginning in December 2007. PNG withstood the crisis. Its GDP growth rates averaged above 2.9 % annually from 1998 to a high of 8.9 % in 2011 .This relates to stable banking and financial regimes; low levels of formal employment; the large percentage of the population living in rural areas, depending almost entirely on subsistence agriculture, fishing and hunting; and the cushioning effect of its social safety net.

There were huge volumes of foreign exchange reserves from 2004 to 2010 that heiped cushion the country. The Bank of PNG stated that 'PNG has seen solid GDP growth over the past decade' and that 'government revenue growth has been increasing at a dramatic rate since 2002. But PNG is not entirely immune from the global crisis. An exchange rate appreciation in 2008 reduced the competitiveness of PNG exports especially labour intensive products from manufacturing and agriculture. The biggest risk to PNG is the weakening demand for its exports in the Asian markets.

Also, PNG does not have broad-based growth and diversified export and government revenue, making the country vulnerable to external shocks. The fiscal position of PNG deteriorated in 2012 due to lower commodity export earnings. In 2013, our annual budget moved away from new capital expenditure to recurrent spending on priority social sectors and infrastructure maintenance.

In welcoming and monitoring the global economy into PNG, we must recognize our national cultural, social and economic context.  If we do not, entry into the global economy will create an uncertain and insecure future for our nation's steady economic growth.

The Constitution emphasises that development can be achieved primarily through the use of PNG forms of social, political and economic organization.

There is need to support small-scale service and business activities, or Small to Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in our traditional villages and communities such that they remain viable units in our society. Any impact of the global economy in ways which diminish the benefits of PNG ways can be considered as undermining the well-being and security of the people and the nation.

## Transnational Crimes 3.2.4

Transnational crime is one of the biggest single threats to global, regional and national security. It threatens peace, human security, and development of many societies around the world.

In PNG, transnational crimes reveal major structural defects which include - but are not limited to - extensive porous international land and maritime borders, weak laws, and even weaker deterrents, absence of effective whole-of -government strategies, lack of inter-agency cooperation and exchange of intelligence, chronic funding constraints, and poor salaries and working conditions for government personnel with responsibilities for border control.

Transnational crimes are currently rated by law enforcement agencies, as our single biggest threat to national security and sovereignty. These include, human smuggling, trafficking of persons, mostly women for sexual exploitation, arms and drugs trafficking, money laundering, illegal currency exports and illegal exports of dangerous and endangered species. The proliferation of small arms and light weapons particularly into the Highlands region also underscores the urgency for a revisit of the final report of the Guns Control Committee.

Greater understanding and interaction of peoples between the two countries will be promoted through existing cooperative frameworks and institutional arrangements.

Trade and investment-related security issues are provided for and discussed under existing arrangements at bilateral level.

## 3.3.1.5  Other Pacific Island Countries

Our relations with other Pacific Island Countries (PIC's) will be pursued through existing institutional arrangements and programs within the spirit of regional cooperation.

## Asia 3.3.2

The Asian region spans a wide geographical area from Indonesia to Pakistan and extends across China to the Korean Peninsula. With the advent of globalisation and emerging security challenges, we will focus on strengthening core relations in this region and seize opportunities to secure and protect our national interest.

## 3.3.2.1 Indonesia

Indonesia shares a common land border with us and will continue to remain a significant player in our foreign policy and security considerations. The two countries relationship has remained strong and is founded on the spirit of mutual respect, friendship, cooperation and understanding.

## 3.3.2.2  People'S Republic Of China (Prc)

PNG continues to maintain a "One-China" policy with the Peoples Republic of China 
(PRC) whilst maintaining close trade and commercial links with the Democratic Republic of China (DPRC) - Taiwan.

China's contribution to the Asia-Pacific region continues to grow both at the bilateral and regional levels. PNG has a defence cooperation relationship with the PRC and will continue to harness such relationship in furtherance of our national interests.

## 3.4.2 Melanesian Spearhead Group (Msg)

The Melanesian Spearhead Group (MSG) constitutes all Melanesian states. It focuses on cooperation on trade, economic and security issues of concern to member states including   framework arrangements for police, customs, NAQIA, civil aviation, defence, immigration, and other law enforcement agencies. PNG remains committed to the MSG, consistent with her national interests.

## 3.4.3 Association Of South East Asian Nations (Asean)

PNG enjoys "special observer "status with ASEAN and remains keen to attain full membership in this important organisation. Full membership would see PNG play a strategic bridging role for the rest of the PICs that have no direct relations with ASEAN. PNG, however, continues to participate in the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) as an equal member. The ARF is an important subsidiary body of ASEAN that specifically deals with security-related issues affecting the region. The ARF provides a forum in which members can discuss regional security issues of concern.

PNG will continue to maintain its links with ASEAN and individual member countries on collaborative security measures that are of primary consideration and importance to the promotion and maintenance of security in the region.

## 3.4.4 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec)

The twenty-one (21) APEC economies have evolved to be a successful economic organisation, whose aim is to build an Asia-Pacific community in achieving sustained economic growth and development through promoting increased cooperation in trade and economic arrangements.

As a small open economy dependent on international trade, PNG joined APEC in November 1993. Almost eighty (80) % of all our international trade and other economic dealings are conducted within the APEC region, hence more logical and necessary for PNG to be a member of the most significant economic trade grouping in this region. PNG will ensure that its trade and economic security interests are actively pursued and protected at all times. This is further strengthened through its effective participation in the World Trade Organisation (WTO).

## Part Ii Internal Security Environment Security Environment 3.5

Our nation faces grave threats across almost every facet of our national life. Our sovereign boundaries, including our extensive 200-Mile Exclusive Economic Zone
(EEZ) is unprotected, our resources on land and sea are open to plunder; our people face a myriad of risks from natural disasters to crime and insecurity, unemployment, poverty, diseases, economic exploitation, loss of identity, terrorism, drugs and alcohol, ethnic violence and disintegration of statehood. We are confronted with man-made as well as natural threats, and physical as well as ideological and psychological challenges. Introduced ways and culture pose significant challenges for us to integrate meaningfully and beneficially to the modern world while posing threat of extinction of our age-old traditions, customs and cultures.

New threats in drug resistant diseases, rampaging viral and bacterial invaders and cyber-crime pose threats against which PNG has little or no defence. Against all these threats PNG lacks capacity and resources but most importantly it has, until now, lacked a co-ordinated approach to meeting these security challenges. This must be addressed as a matter of national priority.

## 3.6 National Security Threats

The generic threats to our nation's survival and well-being, though by no means exhaustive, include the under mentioned:

## 3.6.1 Threats To National Cohesion

PNG's national unity is continuously being undermined by various interest groups since independence. Secessionist movements and calls for self-autonomy continue to challenge our national identity and cohesion as enshrined in the Constitution.

Prominent amongst these sentiments include the demand for independence by certain factions within the Autonomous Region of Bougainville (AROB) and other Provinces.

![34_image_0.png](34_image_0.png)

![34_image_1.png](34_image_1.png)

linea The underlying issues that give rise to such calls include; land and resource ownership; perceived inequitable distribution of wealth; ethnic tension; urban drift; insensitivity by resource developers on land and resource ownership issues and in most cases not meeting their Corporate Social Responsibilities.

## Rural/Urban Drift 3.6.2

The overwhelming majority of our population (87%) live in rural or semi-urban areas while the rest live in urban towns and cities. However this trend is changing rapidly due to rural-urban migration. The increasing number of squatters and urban settlements is becoming a common feature for all PNG's cities and towns. Squatters and urban settlements have become a permanent feature for the PNG urban landscape, especially in Port Moresby with estimated 40% - 50% of the population living in settlements.

Rising number of planned and unplanned settlements are located on state land and customary land as more and more people move into towns and cities in search of employment, education, health services and other opportunities. In Lae City, 50% of the city's populations live in the settlements with rural urban migrants primarily from the Momase, New Guinea Islands and Highlands Region.

The extent of living and working in urban areas is associated with having access to health services, education, lack of deprivation and most of all, well-being of a person and their families. In the drive to acquire these essentials, state and traditional lands are now being illegally occupied as people erect unplanned settlements with living conditions now a major concern as citizen movements become unaccounted by state authorities.

On the other hand, urbanization increases economic activities and reduces poverty at a cost of more land and infrastructure.  If movement of people is not managed, it can exhaust the limited infrastructure, land, water and electricity. Therefore, the rapid rural -- urban shift poses a risk on increase law and order issues, robberies and petty crimes, tribal fighting and violence, unemployment and HIV/Aids.

## 3.6.3 Cyber-Based Threats

The advent of high-tech Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has taken root in PNG and is impacting our society at all levels. The use of GSM and internet technology means that people in remote areas can link up with the outside world more efficiently and at an affordable price.

It also introduces an array of challenges to the family unity as well as issues with public morality at large. While PNG embraces ICT interconnectivity, its jurisdiction remains vulnerable due to the absence of appropriate resourcing, legislations and mechanisms governing ICT administration and regulation. PNG remains vulnerable to Cyber-based crimes such as internet gambling, pornography, terrorism, money laundering, and murder plots. Hacking of national computer systems and theft of trade secrets are very real threats. 

Technological innovations have now made it possible for geologists to sit in a tight geographical information system laboratory in their own countries to discover minerals using complicated infra-red modelling systems in PNG without having to physically come here. This is aided and abetted by the large scale and sophisticated use of the internet globally and in the Asiatic region in particular.

The ICT has also changed warfare tactics considerably such as the use of drones to which PNG could be vulnerable.

## 3.6.4 Border Control

Our borders are highly porous and remain open to illegal activities. This has allowed the proliferation of small arms, drugs, illegal substances and human trafficking, as well as the illegal poaching of our natural resources. This has significantly contributed to law and order problems particularly, gun violence, organised crime and transnational crime.

Border Security agencies must enhance the security of PNG's land borders while facilitating legitimate travel, commerce and protecting human rights. It is important that the borders are secure and the resources within are protected and developed sustainably for all generations, now and for the future.

PNG's 765 kilometre land-border with the world's most populous Muslim nation, Indonesia, requires cross border co-operation strategies to ensure border security. Our maritime boundaries shared with the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) in the north-west, Solomon Islands to the east and Australia in the South must be effectively regulated and managed,

## 3.6.5 Immigration

PNGs land borders are largely unmanned except for the Wutung Border Post, which results in poor management, control of movement of people and goods into and out of the country.  This is starkly evident across the Indonesia - PNG border. These unchecked movements offer the opportunity for illegal cross-border activities. PNG remains committed to ensuring its international obligation towards human rights particularly under the auspices of the UN Commission on Refugees and the Bali Process at the regional level. Thus, PNG's affirmative stance in accommodating refugee issues is testimony to its commitment to global security partnership and cooperation.

Our country is used as a transit point by migrants seeking better economic opportunities elsewhere, especially in Australia and New Zealand. PNG has therefore joined in addressing the asylum seekers problem that has continued to remain a concern for Australia's national security. It also has wider security, socioeconomic and political implications for PNG.

## Small Arms And Light Weapons Proliferation 3.6.6

Smuggling and proliferation of small arms and light weapons is a threat to our national security. Relevant law enforcement authorities are unable to keep a stocktake on the number of both unlicensed factory-made and illegal or home-made weapons that are already in the hands of the public.

Weapons have been smuggled into the country and used in criminal activities, with negative consequential effects including damage to properties and deaths as experienced in tribal fights.

In a bid to curb the proliferation of small and light weapons in PNG, the National Executive Council in 2005 setup the Gun Control Committee (GCC) to address the issue. The GCC 244 recommendations on gun control included the recommendation for a moratorium on the issuance of new firearms.

PNG has participated in UN-sponsored treaty negotiations that seek to outlaw gun proliferation and smuggling.  Key among these are the United Nations Program of Action to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in all its Aspects (UNPoA) and the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT).

People smuggling is a major transnational crime that is of grave concern to countries in the Asia-Pacific region, including PNG. It is a global phenomenon and a lucrative illegal business for all perpetrators. In countries where it is rampant, people smuggling imposes enormous economic and security costs to the receiving and processing countries. Asylum seekers have become victims of this illegal human trade activity at calculated personal cost, as opposed to people seeking genuine refugee status, through established international conventions and protocols. As a signatory to the UN Convention on Human Rights, PNG will remain fully committed to its international obligations by ensuring all processes including apprehension, detention and determination of refugee status, are based on appropriate legislative and administrative frameworks and arrangements.

## 3.6.8 Drug Trafficking

Drug trafficking involves cultivation, transportation and selling of marijuana in PNG
as well as for exports to other neighbouring countries. The problem is further compounded when marijuana is exchanged for guns and ammunitions that are used by criminals and in tribal fights.

Marijuana is now been cultivated illegally in many parts of the country and is becoming a serious concern and open to abuse by the youths.

We also continue to experience smuggling of other illegal drugs by transnational criminals into the country. This leaves our country vulnerable as a transit point for such drugs and its abuse.

## 3.6.9 Organized Crime

Organized crime is deeply rooted in our country and basically involves collusion of some of our unsavoury senior officials of government with criminals. They aid and abet their nefarious activities. Millions of public monies are being squandered by unscrupulous persons and front companies through such alliances One effect of such practices would be continued capital flight across international borders to safe and secured financial and investment havens.  Ultimately, the

## 3.6.10 Illegal Fishing And Poaching

l!legal poaching and fishing, including the harvesting of endangered species across our borders, pose serious threats to the environment as well as the sustenance of the livelihood of people living in coastal and island communities.

PNG is the largest and fertile breeding ground for most valued tuna stocks in the South and South-West Pacific region, thus the need to promote and protect these resources from illegal unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing activities.

These uncontrolled activities require priority attention and focus by relevant agencies through effective surveillance and monitoring mechanisms.

## 3.6.11   Law And Order

Law and order activities in PNG threaten businesses as well as disturbing peace and co-existence equilibriums in the country. Generally, law and order transgressions contribute to much of the internal strife that the public encounters each day.  As a result the Government has placed greater emphases and attention to addressing law and order issues in the country.

Law and order problems have serious and wide-ranging implications for PNG's national interest and security. It tarnishes PNG's international image and reputation, and in many ways deters foreign investments. Lawlessness hinders development and disrupts the delivery of basic government services. It threatens the social fabric of society, businesses, and the well-being of the people.

## 3.6.15 Gender-Based Violence

Gender-based violence represents occurrences of harmful incidences causing injuries or harm to all sexes and children of all ages either within a family, community or other social units. PNG is party to many international conventions dedicated to protecting the rights of all women and children.

However, there are still high incidences of gender-based violence against the most vulnerable and marginalized members of society, including to those living with disabilities, elderly citizens and people living with HIV/AIDS.

Polygamous marriages, extra-marital affairs, sorcery, marriage break-ups, gender insensitivity, deserted wives and children, gambling, alcohol, low income, inability to afford basic necessities and lower status of women are some of the many contributing factors that underpin the increase of gender-based violence.

## 3.6.16   Ethnic/Tribal Fighting

Ethnic and tribal fights continue to be a major security problem. As economic and social issues in the country become more complex, competing demands for limited resources are bound to happen more frequently, as already witnessed in the main urban centres of the country. These are largely driven by high economic expectations, population growth, ethnic diversity and a whole range of other socioeconomic factors.

In the Highlands region where ethnic and tribal fighting is most prevalent, the use of light firearms has replaced traditional bows and arrows. Political patronage contributes to the increase in tribal fights which in turn generate demand for illegal weapons. In most instances, procurement of these weapons is done through the drugs-for-arms trade along the international borders, which is a lucrative illegal enterprise.  In addition, the presence and use of illegal firearms has given rise to a tribal-based arms race and use of local mercenaries between rival tribes.

## 3.6.17 Hiv And Aids

HIV/AIDS is becoming prevalent in PNG and has serious implications on national security. The active population providing the workforce that drives the economy is under threat from the disease.

In addition, the Government's National Health Plan provides a framework for addressing the prevalence in a holistic manner.

Effective stakeholder partnerships and coordination continue to be vital in securing a whole-of-nation approach in combating this destructive threat to our national security.

## 3.6.18   Unemployment And The Youth Bulge

Unemployment and youth associated problems are major social and economic issues impinging on national security. The inadequacy of government institutions and processes to productively engage youths in education, training and skills development and integration into mainstream society is contributing to unemployment and law and order problems. The National Youth Policy provides a framework that could stimulate re-thinking on creative, innovative and productive ways and means of re-orientating youths back into mainstream society.  Effective partnerships and coordination between all stakeholders, through a concerted national approach, is required to address the problems of unemployment and youth bulge.

## 3.6.19 Sorcery

Negative social and cultural practices such as sorcery impede national development and affects social stability, peace and harmony in our society. Problems associated with sorcery should be addressed through appropriate legislative frameworks and administrative processes.

Perceived lack of action has led to public criticisms against PNG, both locally and internationally, for not observing basic human rights of the most vulnerable such as women, children and the aged. The seriousness of these problems have prompted the Government to task the Constitutional Law Reform Commission (CLRC), to review the Sorcery Act of 1971, making it more relevant in addressing this impending threat to our national security.

## 3.6.20   Environmental Degradation

Improper use of the environment has its own devastating consequences. The environment is to be utilised in a sustainable manner to ensure that it continues to provide resources for the people. In PNG, there has been a decline in the manner in which the environment is used thus affecting forestry, biodiversity as reflected in our diminishing flora and fauna. If such a trend continues it will definitely affect the very survival of our people.

It is crucial that PNG adheres to its international obligations such as the Kyoto Protocol, the UN Convention on Bio-Diversity and other international and regional conventions and protocols on environment.

## 3.6.21 Climate Change

We are directly affected by climate change which is a growing global concern, thus a threat to our country's national security.  It is basically the changes that occur to the climate as a result of changing weather patterns. There is growing evidence that human activity is altering the earth's climate at an unprecedented rate, posing grave threat to the environment, people and economies.

Given the paucity of resources, we are vulnerable and will be continuously affected by major disasters and natural calamities when they occur. The Office of Climate Change and Development (OCCD) has been established to identify major threats and help mitigate problems or threats associated with climate change such as coastal and inland flooding, land-slides, damage to coral reefs and rising sea levels.

## 3.6.22   Delivery Of Social Services

Our nation is still progressing at a slow pace to fulfil international standards on the delivery of much needed Social Services to our people. The Department for Community Development and Religion have indicated that the recent and accelerating trends in the economy and the society are contributing to a more risky and vulnerable future for many families in Papua New Guinea.

The delivery of our Social Services such as formal and informal learning opportunities (Education), Urban and Rural Health Services (Health) and Market access will continue to remain a challenge in the absence of a social protection model for the country. The free education and health policy is a positive outcome for ਤੇਤ

A prerequisite for effective service delivery is ensuring that we have basic infrastructure to enhance delivery of services.

## 3.6.23   Natural And Man-Made Disasters

PNG's geological location on the 'Pacific Ring of Fire' renders it highly vulnerable to natural disasters. Such natural calamities take their toll on the lives of the people.

Man-made disasters occur most often due to human errors and lack of compliance with international and national safety standards. The lack of planning, co-ordination and early warning and early response capabilities continue to stifle effective and timely response to all forms of disasters, especially for a developing country like PNG.

## 3.6.24 Vital Assets Protection

All vital installations and key infrastructures are essential part of the economy and national security. Vandalism, theft and disruption of key installations and infrastructure threaten normal government processes and business operations, apart from threats to public safety and security. These require maximum protection and attention to maintain the provision and continuity of core functions and effective service delivery to the state and its people.

The siege mentality and unnecessary disruptions and threats to vital installations and key infrastructure heighten threat levels, which have serious implications on the economy and delivery of basic services.

A policy balance is, therefore, necessary to ensure protection of these vital infrastructure and installations, whilst accommodating genuine economic interests of landholding communities.

## 3.6.25 Food Security

Food security is a problem that continues to impact on the lives of our people, the majority of whom depend on traditional subsistence farming and food production methods to sustain their livelihood. Subsistence economy is largely subject to weather and environmental conditions. Additionally, population pressures among our

![44_image_1.png](44_image_1.png)

34

![44_image_0.png](44_image_0.png)

w Guinea rural communities are impacting on food production and supply. Urban populations are dependent on imported food that is controlled by foreign business interests, thus controlling the bulk of processed food supply into the country.

There is no national capability and contingency plan to respond to food crisis directly as a result of changing global climatic conditions or as a result of disruption in the international global food supply chain, thus exposing PNG's vulnerability in this context.

Appropriate strategies aimed at producing, processing, storing, distributing and feeding our own people in the medium to long term need to be immediately instituted and implemented. National seed-banks containing 'gemplasms' of native food species that the subsistence economy is dependent on, need to be secured as a national priority. There must also be stringent control on the entry of genetically modified food and seeds, as these have wider implications on survivability of native food species.

## 3.6.26   Pests And Diseases

PNG remains vulnerable to the introduction of foreign pests and diseases that pose real security threats to our economy. Provinces where major economic commodity crops such as oil palm, cocoa, coffee, and betel-nut, among others, are grown have been under threat by new pests and diseases. Unless they are detected early and effectively controlled these pests and diseases can destroy important commodity crops.

The prevalence of coconut blight (Bogia coconut syndrome) cocoa pod borer and coffee rust have adversely affected the yielding capacity of economic commodity crops that contribute substantially to the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP).

Furthermore, fruit fly and bird flu have also been detected in the country and are affecting the local fruit production and bird industry.

## 3.6.27 National Information Security

Information is power. States enjoy monopoly over information control and management and their value in national decision-making allows them to stay ahead of those that fall short of doing so. PNG's domestic information space, however, is vulnerable to the threat of exploitation and manipulation by external interests. Its ability to manage and control information inflows and outflows from its jurisdiction is

The lack of control has allowed other states with interest in PNG's affairs to become increasingly knowledgeable on what goes on in the country through effective use of superior information and communication technology. We are aware of the existence of other nation's satellite-based eavesdropping technologies and their strategic value and benefits. However, as a sovereign state concerned with our national security, we must institute appropriate counter measures in securing our jurisdiction and safeguard all sensitive information and communication.

The Government must ensure all its agencies in the information and communication industry and other security actors are empowered to facilitate for the improved information security of the country.

## 3.6.28   Hazardous And Toxic Materials

We do not have appropriate mechanisms in place to determine the volume and level of hazardous and toxic materials that enters the country. We also do not have an effective waste management and disposal system dealing with household and industrial waste. The inability to determine and separate hazardous materials from household disposal waste has resulted in high concentrations of toxic materials entering drainage and sewage systems, hence posing serious public health and environmental risks.

Our obligations under the various environment-related international conventions, including the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), Persistent Organic Pollutants (POP) Convention, and the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) etc., require us to responsibly account for the amount of hazardous and toxic materials, including for their importation, transportation, storage, usage and disposal.

## 3.6.29 Global Terrorism

Terrorist activities pose serious threats to economic prosperity, human rights and destroy innocent lives and properties. Such illegal activities further influence the normal conduct of businesses and peaceful human existence.  The threats of global terrorism have potential security implications on our ability to counter its influence and spread.

![46_image_0.png](46_image_0.png)

36

![46_image_1.png](46_image_1.png)

e a We actively participate and support all efforts by the UN and other regional and international organisations to combat global terrorism.

It is imperative for us to devise appropriate legislative and policy mechanisms to complement global and regional efforts in combating the threat of terrorism.

## 3.6.30   Proliferation And Excesses Of Private Security Companies

The private security industry is a rapidly growing industry that provides employment for thousands of PNG citizens. There is a huge gap between the state's abilify to deliver public safety and the society's need for collective peace and order. It is compounded by the escalating law and order problems, thus adding to the growth of the industry.

Apart from the existence of national Private Security Companies, there is a steady increase in foreign Private Security Companies operating in the country's security market. Their engagement in specialist and technical security tasks and operations in areas designed for PNG's state security agencies is a concern and requires urgent intervention by the PNG Security Industry Authority (SIA) to monitor and effectively regulate the security industry.

Furthermore, the growing presence and involvement of foreign Private Security Companies in the country undermines the state's ability and authority to deliver public safety and security. It is compounded by the growing negative public sentiments against their presence which is viewed as undermining and denying local participation in the industry. Of serious concern is the uncontrolled importation and use of firearms by some of these companies. There is urgent need for appropriate legislative measures to be instituted to sufficiently address this national concern.

## Human Resource Management And Remuneration 3.6.31

The Public Service of PNG is established and empowered by relevant legislations and the General Orders (GO) to service the government officers (public servants).

Apart from the Public Service, there are other government service organisations, disciplined forces and statutory organisations, including the teaching service that are established by respective legislations, which have their own terms and conditions of employment that run parallel to the public service.

service organisations, aching service that are rms and conditions of While there are existing and accepted terms and conditions of employment in the public service, there is an urgent need to constantly review, update and improve the remuneration package and other terms and conditions for public servants.

The main challenge in the PNG public service is that the conditions of service for public servants such as housing, basic salary, risk allowance and other important forms of allowances are either non-existent or calculated at a very low rate which is well below the international labour market rates. The status quo has led to public servants living in settlements, non or late attendance and poor work morale. This has contributed to allegations of malpractices against public servants including; corruption, mismanagement and misappropriation and lack of efficient and effective service delivery.

On a similar note, competitive remuneration packages and other terms and conditions of employment in the public service must be mirrored with improved accountability by public servants in the discharge of their respective duties and responsibilities. These issues need the serious attention of Government.

## 3.6.32 Raskolism

Raskolism refers to all forms of criminality. It is prevalent in both the urban and rural areas and is a serious national security concern. It presents significant challenges for law enforcement and justice sector agencies, as it consumes and distorts the allocation and use of large portions of public resources annually. Raskolism induced law and order problems create unplanned spending to the detriment of planned expenditures intended for productive areas.

Raskol gangs have now graduated into organised crime syndicates permeating all levels of society. These syndicates have cultivated links with rouge elements within the law enforcement and justice sectors, thus undermining their integrity and ability to effectively deliver on their mandated responsibilities. They are even linked to international criminal syndicates that involve in crimes such as money laundering, pornography, drugs for arms trade and other illegal activities.

There is an urgent need for appropriate parliamentary oversight committees to be established and empowered to impeach people who are linked to and play patronage to crime syndicates. There is need to strengthen appropriate institutional, legal and accountability framework to insulate institutions and persons against corrupt practices and influence promoted by crime syndicates.

![48_image_0.png](48_image_0.png)

38

![48_image_1.png](48_image_1.png)

linea Effective collaboration and partnership between all stakeholders in the private sector and international community is encouraged to counter this pervasive problem.

## 3.6.33 Downstream Processing

Our exports are predominantly raw materials or semi processed goods while less emphasis is placed on downstream processing; hence their vulnerability to international market shocks and fluctuations. Domestic factors of production are not effectively utilised to ensure diversification of production across all sectors for both domestic and external consumption.

The GDP contribution from the manufacturing sector is at all-time low, thus signifying the urgent need to develop and expand the sector through downstream processing initiatives and major policy drivers such as the Government's push for the development of Small-to-Medium Enterprises (SMEs).

Downstream processing adds value to PNG's products for both domestic and external markets. It also enables a more efficient use of the factors of production that will absorb the population into mainstream economy, by providing meaningful opportunities for gainful employment. This will enhance the country's ability to effectively mitigate law and order and related problems.

Expansion of the production and economic base, through downstream processing, cushions the country against external shocks and enhances PNG's competitiveness in international trade and commerce. Such a posture would enable us to consolidate and advance our economic and national security interests.

## 3.6.34 Illegal Resource Exploitation

Substantial amount of national revenue is being lost annually as a result of illegal resource exploitation. Our country continues to be subjected to illegal and unfettered exploitation schemes driven by unscrupulous external commercial interests.  We have been unable to deter such illegal activities in economically vulnerable sectors, such as land, forestry, fisheries, mining, and Oil and Gas, due mainly to poor governance. The illegal land acquisition, harvesting and export of tropical timber, and the subsequent revenue loss through transfer-pricing schemes continue unabated.

In the mining, oil and gas sectors, manipulative influences upon exploration and licensing system and processes, continue to have negative effects on the economy. In this regard, a common trend involves the uncontrolled influx of non-reputable companies involved in trading exploration licenses to the highest international bidder.

We will continue to be denied of real national income if appropriate corrective measures are not taken.

A whole-of-nation approach is therefore required for effective partnerships and collaboration among all stakeholders, to address the problem of corporate theft of our resources and national revenue.

## 3.6.35   Business Enclaves

Our rich natural resources is attracting unprecedented commercial and business interests by multinational corporations and other global interests, especially in the mining, oil and gas, forestry, fisheries, and agricultural sectors. Enclave townships and zones are being established and controlled where accessibility by ordinary citizens and government officials is difficult Use of company roads, airports, medical facilities, banking services, and bridges in some of the most rugged and inhospitable areas are being restricted, thus denying remote populations from utilising these critical infrastructures for improving their livelihoods and well-being.

In areas where logging, oil palm and other resource development activities are taking place, local people employed by these companies are being discriminated upon and denied legal employment rights, including right of dissent, association and assembly.

In some provinces, regular members of the police force are being employed to provide security for these enclave economic regions. The existence and behaviour of these economic enclaves undermine state authority and control, including its ability to adequately service its remote and disadvantaged populations.

National security policy imperatives on human security are necessary to ensure multinational corporations and other economic sector investors and entities do not undermine state authority and denial of the basic rights of our people. It is in this context that integration of such enclaves with the mainstream economy through appropriate legislative and policy frameworks become imperative.

Since Independence, national security has lacked effective co-ordination and implementation. There has been a disjointed, haphazard approach to co-ordinating security across the nation such that the institutions of national security have been ineffective. Consequently we have serious discrepancies in manner in which national security is managed. The status quo has further led to significant challenges that continue to undermine our development efforts.

Additionally, our ability to respond to national disasters has always been slow and uncoordinated causing unnecessary loss of life and property. This situation can be better addressed through effective coordination and implementation mechanisms.

# Chapter 4 Prioritsation Of Png'S Security Challenges

## 4.1 Prioritisation Of Security Threats

It is very important that in designing the NSP, threats are identified and ranked in order of their imminence or likely occurrence and their seriousness when they do occur. Some might be most likely such as the common flu but might not have serious consequences while others like a nuclear war might be unlikely but will cause maximum and very serious damage if they did occur. Ranking the threats will assist government to plan adequate responses to each security threat without wasting limited resources.

For the purposes of the NSP, threats to PNG security are divided into two levels.

Level one threats are the most likely to occur, cause the most damage when they do occur and require immediate and urgent attention. Level Two threats are those that are not the most urgent and might not require immediate and urgent response, or if they do occur, the threat level is not high in terms of damage done. Level two threats are also those that are slowly emerging, which require action over a longer period but also pose significant threats in future.

These rankings determine our Strategic Policy Goals and Implementation Strategies in Chapter 6 and our National Security Policy Action Plan.  However, it is to be noted that these rankings are not permanent and will necessarily change from time to time given national security situations.

## 4.1.1 Level One Threats

Level One threat to PNGs national security in order of priority includes:
.

Law and Order
.

Graft and Corruption and good Governance Human Rights abuses and gender based violence
.

.

Lack of Border Control
.

Natural disasters and climate change
.

Small arms and light weapons trafficking and proliferation lllegal poaching of resources
�
.

Drug, alcohosl and substance abuse
.

Microbial attacks on plant, animal and human lives
.

Medical emergencies including HIV & AIDS, TB and Malaria 42

ked in iey do erious cause assist asting levels.

ney do se that e, or if
:hreats period itegies : noted lo time Level One threat requires the highest state of alertness, preparedness and response.

Law and order problems, including tribal violence in parts of the country, pose grave and immediate danger to national life. It requires urgent multifaceted responses across the entire government sector to bring it under control. Tribal and regional animosities may degenerate into unfathomable hatred and violence, the extreme type being that which tore the African nation of Rwanda. This too is a simmering cauldron which requires urgent study and preventive strategies, Graft and corruption present peculiar threat to PNG's national security. If allowed to run their course, they will destroy PNG government and our institutions, ruin development programs, create instability and ultimately cause us to become a failed state. The fact that corruption is now deeply entrenched qualifies it to be a level one threat requiring urgent government attention and action.

Alcohol, drugs and arms smuggling pose grave level one threat to national security.

Their impact upon families, companies and communities are nothing short of disastrous and require national strategies to contain them.

All natural disasters require immediate responses. They are normally unexpected and catastrophic. Because the country sits uncomfortably on the Pacific Ring of Fire, seismic activity is quite high. In addition, unpredictable weather patterns cause a variety of serious and prolonged periods of rain or drought with their resulting disastrous   consequences such as flooding or famine.

Diseases and microbial attacks on animal, plant and human lives also pose immediate threats with devastating consequences.

HIV and AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, polio, and pneumonia are among the biggest killers in PNG. Aside from HIV & AIDS, responses to most of these diseases have been inadequate.HIV, bird flu, Newcastle disease and cyber-based attacks are examples of these forms of attacks against which PNG responses are lacking or still infantile.

4.1.2

## Level Two Threats

Security threats under this category do not mean that they are any less important but they require a lower priority ranking. Depending on circumstances any threat in this category can very quickly be moved to Level One ranking.

![54_image_0.png](54_image_0.png)

![54_image_1.png](54_image_1.png)

Level Two security threats are many and the list below is not exhaustive. They include:
External & internal military aggression issues including military invasion,
.

military coups, border tensions, inter-disciplinary force tensions and clashes; Social sector issues such as health care, hygiene, water and sanitation, infant

## Chapter 5 Institutional Policy Frameworks And Gaps

Government requires appropriate guidance by relevant policy frameworks, including enabling legislations and resources, to effectively implement the NSP,
The following areas require the GoPNG's immediate attention:
.

. . •
Institutional and Sectoral Gaps Enabling legislations Policy Frameworks Institutional Harmonisation and Leadership Coordination
.

.

Resourcing

## 5.1 Institutional And Sectoral Gaps

Significant gaps in the management of national security activities exist within and across different sectors.  This has resulted in piecemeal approaches in lieu of a whole-of-government co-ordinated system.  The NSP provides the basis upon which an appropriate coordination mechanism can be crafted to address this discrepancy.

## 5,2 Legislative And Policy Frameworks

Disjointed and uncoordinated approaches to national security also emanate from lack of comprehensive legislative and policy frameworks.  This in turn leads to problems such as wastage of resources, overlapping and duplication of roles and responsibilities, and the tendency to work in silos - making coordination difficult.

## 5.3 Institutional Harmonisation To Strengthen Whole-Of-Government Approach To National Security

All Government agencies continue to operate within their own frameworks with minimal consideration towards building a holistic culture for effective service delivery.

This 'tunnel vision' approach undermines efforts to encourage and build co-operation among the agencies to enhance national security.

The NSP not only unifies

![57_image_0.png](57_image_0.png)

development and security, but also provides the vehicle to harmonise all efforts in line with the Whole-of-Government Approach.  Ultimately, this endeavour requires change of the people's mindset: improved national security is only possible once they recognise that ensuring peace and stability of the country starts with every citizen.

## Synergistic Approach To National Security 5.4

Key actors in the security sector have their respective legislative and relevant frameworks to guide them in addressing national security issues.

Sectors such as Transport, Agriculture, Economic, Information Communication and the Social Sectors have their respective sectoral strategies, which must now integrate security considerations into their management and operational programs and processes.

Figure 2 below shows the linkages between the NSP and these sectors.

## 5.5 The Need For Effective Coordination

The continuing lack of timely and efficient reporting and decision-making on both domestic and international security issues undermines the effective management of national security. This problem is compounded by the lack of proper co-ordination among all key security sector agencies.

An appropriate central co-ordination mechanism is of paramount importance to the implementation of the NSP and the effective management of national security.  A National Security Co-ordination Office, therefore, is to be established and given the appropriate mandate and capacity to oversee all matters and operations relating to national security.  The Office of Security Co-ordination and Assessment (OSCA) within the Department of Prime Minister and NEC is presently performing coordination and assessment functions. However, the whole-of-government approach envisions a more elaborate co-ordination process.  Therefore, there is a need for OSCA to be upgraded to a higher authoritative body to serve this coordination function.

Figure 2 also illustrates the need for proper co-ordination among all sectors of government under the Whole-of-Government Approach.

## Chapter 7 Monitoring And Evaluation

The success of the NSP is everyone's responsibility. Citizens have moral and ethical responsibilities to protect their families, neighbors including public and private properties. They are obliged to provide information to government agencies at the national and sub-national levels on matters posing serious threats to national Public servants have a responsibility to ensure the safety of our people, protect our resources and the integrity of our institutions. This means employing officers with the requisite skills to achieve desired outcomes with excellence.

The NSP provides the strategic direction to effectively deliver national security whilst its Action Plan fulfills the goals of the policy. Therefore, policy co-ordination, review, and monitoring of the implementing processes are critical to the successful implementation of the national security policy.

Performance of the NSP will be measured through three main processes. These are; Co-ordination of the policy's implementation strategies;
.

•
Monitoring and evaluation; and,
•
Review of these strategies.

The monitoring of the implementation of the NSP will be achieved through an evaluation of the performance of the agencies; which will encompass accountability, resource application and use, and agency responsibilities that are aligned to the NSP

## 7.1 Lead Agencies Overseeing Monitoring And Evaluation

At the strategic level, the National Security Council chaired by the Prime Minister provides the political oversight and strategic leadership for the NSP as well as making informed decisions on security issues affecting the country.

The National Security Advisory Committee (NSAC) which is the steering committee of the NSP is chaired by the Chief Secretary to Government. The NSAC will oversee the implementation and monitoring of the policy. The Office of Security Co-ordination and Assessment (OSCA), which is proposed to become the National Security Agency
(NSA) will monitor the implementation of the NSP on behalf of the NSAC.

7.5

## Resourcing

The resourcing of NSA and the M&E of the NSP will be drawn from the proposed
'Security and International Relations' financial sector through the annual budget submitted by NSA.

7.6

## Inputs And Outputs

All government agencies, co-opted civil organisations and individuals, must provide NSP M&E input to the NSA. The NSA will be responsible for merging M&E inputs into data that can be analysed and presented to the NSAC.

7.7

## Verification And Reporting

The verification of NSP M&E will be effected through an Annual National Security Monitoring and Evaluation Report which will be managed by the NSA. The core inputs for the report will come from the National Security Agencies' Annual Reports; Finance and Treasury Reports and reports from all other relevant government agencies.
