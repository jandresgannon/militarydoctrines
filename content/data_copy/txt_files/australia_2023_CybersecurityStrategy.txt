## Minister’s Foreword

As Australia’s first Cabinet Minister for Cyber
Security I am focused on creating a digital
environment that is safe, trusted and secure.
As a nation we have a unique opportunity to
move cyber security beyond a niche technical
field to a strategic national security capability
that underpins our future prosperity.

The case for change is clear. Australia has
a patchwork of policies, laws and frameworks
that are not keeping up with the challenges
presented by the digital age. Voluntary
measures and poorly executed plans will
not get Australia where we need to be to
thrive in the contested environment of 2030.

The digital age presents enormous
opportunities. To achieve our vision of
being the world’s most cyber secure country
by 2030, we need the unified effort of
government, industry and the community.
Together, we can equip our community to
reduce the number and impact of cyber
incidents through improved cyber hygiene
and provide clear advice on how to respond
confidently when they occur.

This discussion paper is an opportunity
to provide your views on how we can work
together to make Australia a world-leader
in cyber security by 2030. This means:

- Australia has a secure economy
and thriving cyber ecosystem;

- our critical infrastructure and
government systems are resilient
and secure;

- we have a sovereign and assured
capability to counter cyber threats;
and

- Australia is a trusted and influential
global cyber leader, working in
partnership with our neighbours
to lift cyber security and build
a cyber resilient region.


I have appointed an Expert Advisory Board
to assist and advise the Government on the
development of the 2023-2030 Australian
_Cyber Security Strategy. The Board is chaired_
by former Telstra CEO Andrew Penn AO,
who is joined by Mel Hupfeld AO DSC and
Rachael Falk. The Board is working closely
with industry, civil society and academia
to advise the Australian Government on
the steps we need to take to make Australia
the most cyber secure nation in the world
by 2030. The Assistant Foreign Minister, the
Hon. Tim Watts MP, is also closely involved in
the development of the 2023-2030 Australian
_Cyber Security Strategy, leading our approach_
to how Australia can work in partnership with
our region to lift our collective cyber security.

Setting Australia up for success in the digital
age begins with meaningful engagement and
transformative partnerships across all levels
of government, industry and the community.
To achieve this goal, the Government is
developing the 2023-2030 Australian Cyber
_Security Strategy, and we want you to be_
a part of the discussion.

## Introduction  from the Expert Advisory Board

##### Technology continues to develop at a rapid pace and it is already an integral part of the Australian way of life – it connects our cities, workplaces, schools, and homes. The mobile devices we carry with us every day are super computers in our pockets. Technological advancements have meant that things that once took hours can now be done instantly via a browser, such as checking on our pets at home, shopping 24/7 from the convenience of our homes, and screening visitors at our front doors from thousands of kilometres away.


While this is a discussion paper for the
_2023-2030 Australian Cyber Security Strategy_
(the ‘Strategy’), when we refer to ‘cyber’ we
mean the conduit by which all Australians can
engage in a wide range of activity digitally
such as shopping, banking, work, education,
and healthcare. However, we also note that
‘cyber’ provides a conduit for crime, foreign
interference, espionage, disinformation and
misinformation. Cyber security is the means
by which the cyber foundations of the digital
world are secured. We are seeking your
views to inform our recommendations to
Government as to what it should consider
when developing cyber security measures
to better protect and enhance our collective
cyber resilience, both in Australia and in
the region.


Our national resilience, economic success,
and security rely on us getting our cyber
settings right. Importantly, 99% of Australians
now have access to the internet.[1] During
the COVID 19 pandemic, classrooms and
workplaces moved entirely online, which
contributed to the rapid acceleration of living
in a digitally connected world. The adoption
of digital technologies by some organisations
was sped up by three to seven years in
just months.[2]

Uplifting Australia’s cyber resilience would
also provide a significant boost to the
domestic digital economy. The Australian
cyber market contributed approximately
$2.4 billion in Gross Value Added (GVA)
in 2022, and the sector’s GVA grew by
11% from 2020 to 2022.[3]

3 AustCyber Sector Competitiveness Plan (2022)


-----

The CSIRO estimates that Australia’s cyber
security revenue could reach $6 billion per
year in 2026.[4]

The rise in revenues and employment
in the cyber security industry also has
flow-on benefits for a range of domestic
sectors and areas of sovereign capability.
Australian businesses rely on cyber security
professionals to secure their technologies,
protect valuable intellectual property, and
ensure that customers can trust Australian
technical goods and services. In emerging
fields such as quantum technologies,
artificial intelligence, biotechnologies, and
robotics, cyber security professionals are a
vital enabler for the development of assured
sovereign capabilities for Australia and our
international supply chains.

While this means the world is at our
fingertips, there is a darker side to living in
a cyber-connected world. Just as Australians
have rapidly adopted digital goods, education
and services, cyber criminals and nation
states have also exploited cyber and the
world in which we live. They are highly
adaptable, adept, and are readily exploiting
vulnerabilities: both software and human.

According to the Australian Cyber Security
Centre’s (ACSC) 2021-22 Threat Report,
one incident is reported on average every
7 minutes[5] with over 76,000 cybercrime
reports in 2021-22.[6] Cyber-enabled crimes
such as romance and investment scams,
business email compromise, ransomware
and phishing emails have been successful
in stealing identities and money from
organisations and hard-working Australians.

Ransomware and associated extortion
threats, espionage and fraud have become
a significant threat to Australian
organisations, large and small. There was
no greater example of this than in September
and October 2022, when over a three-week
period the personal data of over 9.8 million
Optus customers and 9.7 million Medibank
customers was stolen by cyber criminals. The
scale and severity of these breaches meant
that cyber security became a topic that is
now front and centre in board rooms and
living rooms. It became clear during these


incidents that government was ill-equipped
to respond, and did not have the appropriate
frameworks and powers to enable an
effective national response given the number
of Australians whose personal information,
including identity data, was compromised.

While the companies themselves were
impacted by these breaches, it is their
customers who are the real victims of
these insidious crimes. These breaches
demonstrate why more needs to be done
to make sure our laws recognise there is
widespread data collection and government
and industry both have an essential role
to play in hardening networks and securing
our economy. The Strategy must reflect the
importance of protecting customer data,
and ensure that all organisations have the
right cyber security settings in place to make
Australia is the most cyber secure nation
in the world by 2030. We also need to make
sure that we have the right legal and policy
settings in place to help break the food chain
when it comes to ransomware and related
demands from – and payments to –
cyber criminals.

All of us must play a role in keeping our
critical data, systems and infrastructure
safe. From government departments, large
organisations, small to medium businesses,
academia and society as a whole. This
involves not just best practice operational
standards, raising awareness about online
scams, or ensuring connected devices are
secure by design: it means we must also turn
our minds to current and future cyber security
threats, and work together to do all that we
can to protect Australians and our regional
partners from these threats.

If we are to lift and sustain cyber resilience
and security, it must be an integrated wholeof-nation endeavour. We need a coordinated
and concerted effort by governments,
individuals, and businesses of all sizes.

We believe that the development of a new
forward-looking Strategy for Australia is a
unique opportunity for us to be ambitious
and innovative. Any successful strategy must
be national in scope, enduring, affordable,
achievable, and allow for flexibility to
account for changes in the dynamic cyber
environment out to 2030.

We appreciate there have been a number
of consultations on cyber security and related
topics over the last three years, and we will
build on this feedback. We also want to make
sure that this discussion paper provides
you with the opportunity to contribute your
views to shape the Australian Government’s
approach to domestic and international cyber
security at this crucial moment as we move
into an increasingly online world.

We welcome your ideas and look forward
to receiving your submissions.

## Australia’s Cyber Security Opportunity

##### The Australian Government’s goal of becoming  the most cyber secure nation by 2030 is an ambitious aspiration. It recognises that the transition to a digital economy relies on the ability to trust that our personal data, infrastructure, and underpinning systems are secure, even as  the cyber threat landscape evolves. Our ambition to become the most cyber secure nation by 2030 can be balanced with our liberal democratic values, and the objective of ensuring Australians can continue to access, engage with, and benefit from the online world.


##### What would Australia look like  as the most cyber secure nation by 2030?

In 2030, every aspect of our lives – social,
economic, and cultural – is underpinned by
digital connectivity. We live in an increasingly
contested and congested cyber environment
with state and non-state threat actors,
and emergent technologies – like artificial
intelligence and quantum computing –
shaping the cyber security threat landscape
in unpredictable ways. But we have invested
in enduring and adaptive sovereign
capabilities to build national cyber
resilience, which means Australians
engage in cyberspace with confidence
and assurance.


By 2030, Australia is internationally
recognised as a leading brand for cyber
goods and services. This means consumers
expect advanced cyber security built-in
by-design, sold at a reasonable price,
designed and manufactured by a workforce
with world-leading cyber skills under fair
working conditions.

The Australian regulatory system facilitates
innovation and stimulates economic growth
and recovery. Australian-made products
set the international benchmark for cyber
services, created in a way that reflects the
values of a democratic society; leading on
safety and security while respecting basic
rights. Customers expect cyber secure
technologies in the same way they expect
a car to be sold with a seatbelt.


-----

Internationally, Australia is a respected
partner, collaborating with and supporting
countries in our region and globally to
defend the international rules-based order
in cyberspace. Australia has built a safe and
inclusive online environment, and broader
prosperity, upon a strong foundation of cyber
resilience in our region. A multi-stakeholder
system that places individuals, industry,
civil society academia and governments
on an equal footing ensures responsible
and accountable technical management
and governance of the Internet.

With our critical infrastructure increasingly
reliant on internet connectivity, Australians
have confidence that their access to water,
electricity or online banking will not be
disrupted because of a cyber incident.
While cyber attacks remain prevalent,
our continued cyber resilience means
we apply learnings from regular scenario
planning and testing to ensure we have
the right preventative measures in place.
When a cyber incident does occur, we have
an agile and rapid response to mitigate its
harm, recover quickly, and disrupt further
malicious acts.

Realising this vision will require that all
Australians – regardless of when they were
born, where they live, and what language
they speak at home – know what practical
actions they need to take to keep their
personal information, businesses, and
families safe online.

This discussion paper represents the
start of an ongoing conversation around
how the Australian Government can lay
the foundations for a cyber secure future,
recognising that all Australians have a
vital role to play in keeping Australia safe.


-----

## Approach to Consultation

##### The Strategy will be developed  in partnership with industry academia, state and territory governments and the Australian and international community.  Like Australia’s cyber security, the Strategy will be a team effort, building on our history of collaborative cyber resilience.

Australia is uniquely placed to define and
adopt world-leading policies in cyber security.
Since Defence 2000: Our Future Defence
_Force, Australia has been alert to the need_
to consider cyber security as a matter of
national security.

_Australia’s Cyber Security Strategy 2016_
introduced cyber security as a risk to a
broad audience at the foundational level,
and Australia’s Cyber Security Strategy 2020
then recommended action across three pillars:
governments protecting against sophisticated
cyber threats, businesses protecting their
customers, and the community making
cyber-aware choices.

Australia’s Cyber Security Strategy 2020 was
complemented by Australia’s 2021 International
_Cyber and Critical Technology Engagement_
_Strategy, which set out Australia’s vision_
for a safe, secure and prosperous Australia,
Indo-Pacific region and world, enabled by
cyberspace and critical technology. Moving
forward, domestic and international cyber
security policy considerations will be
combined into a whole-of-nation effort
under the Strategy.


The development of the previous cyber
strategies has been followed by consultations
on the Security of Critical Infrastructure Act
(the SOCI Act), the Strengthening Australia’s
_Cyber Security Regulations and Incentives_
discussion paper, and the National Data
_Security Action Plan discussion paper._
The Strategy will leverage these consultations
and public submissions.

The Expert Advisory Board has commenced
consultation on the Strategy through a series
of roundtables focussed on the core policy
themes identified in this discussion paper.
Consultation will continue through to the
drafting and publication of the final Strategy
before the end of 2023.

The Expert Advisory Board and the
Department of Home Affairs will lead
consultations on domestic components
of the Strategy, and partner with the
Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade
to lead international-themed consultations
to ensure that the Strategy accounts for
global perspectives and partnerships.

The Minister for Home Affairs and Cyber
Security and the Expert Advisory Board are
also being advised on global best practice
by a Global Advisory Panel comprising the
best minds from our closest allies. The Global
Advisory Panel is chaired by Ciaran Martin CB,
former CEO of the United Kingdom’s National
Cyber Security Centre.

## The 2023-2030  Australian Cyber Security Strategy


Australia’s cyber landscape has evolved
significantly since Australia’s Cyber Security
_Strategy 2020 was released. COVID-19_
highlighted our critical dependence on
cyber for our productivity, prosperity, and
national security as Australians spent more
time online than ever before. The RussiaUkraine conflict demonstrated that cyber
attacks by both nation states and criminal
groups can rapidly spill across borders and
affect critical infrastructure and essential
services around the world.[7] The Optus and
Medibank incidents also represented two
of the most significant data breaches
in Australia’s history.

Collectively, these events underscore
an urgent need to deliver a national cyber
security strategy which:

- takes lessons learned from previous
stakeholder consultations and major
incidents to inform current policy
responses;

- sets out the priorities for Australia’s
cyber security uplift from 2023-2030;
and

- seizes opportunities to get ahead of
changes in the risk environment, harness
new technologies, and position Australia
as a global leader on cyber.


There are a range of other important
Government priorities which will significantly
enhance Australia’s digital security and which
will progress in parallel with the Strategy.
These include:

- the outcomes of the Attorney-General
Department’s Review of the Privacy
_Act 1988;_

- the National Plan to Combat Cybercrime;

- the Australian Competition and
Consumer Commission Digital Platform
_Services Inquiry 2020–25;_

- Commonwealth Digital ID policy
development and reforms;

- measures enhancing the growth
of critical technology industries
and resilience of supply chains led
by the Minister for Industry and Science,
including the National Quantum Strategy;
and

- investment through the REDSPICE
(Resilience, Effects, Defence, Space,
Intelligence, Cyber, Enablers) package
administered by the Minister for Defence.

The Privacy Act Review Report was publicly
released on 16 February 2023 for consultation
on the development of the Government
response to the report. Public consultation
will remain open until 31 March 2023.
The feedback received will also contribute
to the development of the Strategy.

## Priorities for  the 2023-2030  Australian Cyber Security Strategy

The Minister for Home Affairs
and Cyber Security has noted:

#### “Everyone has skin in the game when it comes to Australia’s cyber security. If you use the internet, have a smart device in your home, or have a perspective on what Australia’s cyber security should look like, I encourage you to get involved as the Expert Advisory Board seeks views throughout the Strategy’s development.”

##### What ideas would you like to see included in the Strategy to make Australia the most cyber secure nation in the world by 2030?

This section of the Discussion Paper outlines:

- the core policy areas that the Expert
Advisory Board expects will be addressed
in the Strategy; and

- a series of potential policy areas, where
the Expert Advisory Board is seeking your
feedback on what action the Australian
Government should take to become the
world’s most cyber secure nation in the
world by 2030.


-----

##### Core policy areas to be included in the 2023-2030 Australian Cyber Security Strategy

 Enhancing and harmonising regulatory frameworks

We have heard from industry that business
owners often do not feel their cyber security
obligations are clear or easy to follow, both
from an operational perspective and as
company directors. There are a range of
implicit cyber security obligations placed
on Australian businesses and nongovernment entities, including through
the corporations, consumer, critical
infrastructure, and privacy legislative
and regulatory frameworks. However, it
is clear from stakeholder feedback and
the increasing frequency and severity of
major cyber incidents, that more explicit
specification of obligations, including
some form of best practice cyber security
standards, is required across the economy
to increase our national cyber resilience
and keep Australians and their data safe.

To be the most cyber secure nation in
the world by 2030, Australians should
have confidence that digital products
and services sold are fit for purpose and
include appropriate best practice cyber
security protections.

There may also be opportunities to
simplify and streamline existing regulatory
frameworks. For example, stakeholders
have encouraged government to streamline
reporting obligations and response
requirements following a major
cyber incident.


It is clear that a package of regulatory
reform is necessary. How this would be
implemented, including the potential
consideration of a new Cyber Security Act,
drawing together cyber-specific legislative
obligations and standards across industry
and government, and the details of these
reforms is something on which feedback
will be welcomed. This should also consider
whether further developments to the
SOCI Act are warranted, such as including
customer data and ‘systems’ in the definition
of critical assets to ensure the powers
afforded to government under the SOCI Act
extend to major data breaches such as those
experienced by Medibank and Optus, not just
operational disruptions.


_See further questions at Attachment A._

##### Strengthening Australia’s international strategy on  cyber security

Combined with domestic uplift, strengthened
international leadership will enable us
to seize opportunities and address the
challenges presented by the shifting cyber
environment. Australia is a respected voice
in addressing the challenge of making the
world a safer place online. We can leverage
this voice through tangible steps to shape
global thinking, particularly in relation to new
and emerging technologies.

Cyber resilience is also essential to unlocking
economic opportunity and prosperity in our
region. Investments in areas such as health,
infrastructure, and education are not secure
if they are not underpinned by effective
cyber security.


###### What legislative or regulatory reforms should the Government pursue to enhance cyber resilience across the digital economy?


-----

Assistant Minister for Foreign Affairs,
the Hon. Tim Watts MP, has noted:

#### “This is not a challenge we face alone. We all – Australia, our region and the global community – benefit from a stable and resilient cyber space. Indeed, without cyber security other gains are too easily lost. 
 Whether it’s developing international cyber space laws and norms, holding accountable those that flout the rules, working to lift regional cyber resilience or leveraging our humanitarian response track record to respond to severe cyber attacks, working with partners is essential to a prosperous and secure  cyber environment.”


There are three sets of opportunities to
explore through consultation on the 20232030 Australian Cyber Security Strategy:

1. How Australia can elevate the existing
level of engagement with international
partners through concrete steps to
promote cyber resilience?

2. What opportunities are there to better
support the development of international
technology standards, particularly in
relation to cyber security?

3. How can government and industry
partner to uplift cyber resilience and
secure access to the digital economy,
especially in Southeast Asia and the
Pacific?


###### How should Australia better contribute to international standards- setting processes in relation to cyber security, and shape laws, norms and standards that uphold responsible state behaviour in cyber space?


###### How can Australia, working with our neighbours, build our regional cyber resilience and better respond to cyber incidents?


###### What opportunities exist for Australia to elevate its existing international bilateral and multilateral partnerships from  a cyber security perspective?


-----

##### Securing government systems

The Commonwealth Government controls
and processes some of Australia’s most
sensitive data to deliver essential public
services. Australia continues to be the target
of persistent cybercrime and espionage by
a wide range of criminal and state actors,
including foreign intelligence services,
seeking information on political, diplomatic,
military, and personal data.[8]

Government should stand as an exemplar of
cyber security; however the Commonwealth
_Cyber Security Posture in 2022 report (the_
Cyber Posture Report) reveals government
agencies have a long way to go to properly
secure government systems. Only 11%
of entities in the Cyber Posture Report
reached Overall Maturity Level 2 through the
implementation of Essential Eight controls,
and the majority of entities are yet to
implement basic policies and procedures.

Public sector cyber security is comprised of
both non-technical and technical elements,
and it is crucial to consider both when
considering how to better secure government
systems. Non-technical aspects include
things like governance frameworks and
accountability mechanisms, cyber security
culture, and risk management planning.
Technical aspects include elements such as
inventory management and legacy systems,
variation across government systems and
attack surfaces, and the nature of essential
services delivered by each entity.

While acknowledging the work done under
previous strategies, these have not achieved
the level of progress required to meet
the Government’s vision. Leadership and
accountability are critical at all levels and
in all organisations to deliver the Strategy.
Enhancing government cyber posture will
require a framework which accounts for:

- best practice standards, evaluation,
transparency, reporting, and aligned
incentives; and

- the appropriate support, accountability
and leadership for individual government
departments and agencies to manage
their cyber security risk profile.


###### How can Commonwealth Government departments and agencies better demonstrate  and deliver cyber security best practice and serve as a model  for other entities?


##### Areas for Potential Action  by 2030

In addition to the core policy areas, where
it is clear interventions will be addressed in
the Strategy, there are a range of other areas
where potential policy options to enhance
cyber resilience could be considered in the
Strategy. We are seeking views to inform
advice to Government on the following
potential areas for policy action:

##### Improving public-private mechanisms for cyber threat sharing and blocking

There is a broad spectrum of options
available to enhance cyber security threat
sharing and blocking through public-private
partnerships. This requires analysis of
feasible technical approaches, which can
be deployed sustainably at scale. However,
improved threat sharing should also consider
qualitative issues, such as government
practice related to information sharing,
access, declassification of intelligence,
and existing regulatory frameworks such
as the Privacy Act and the Surveillance
_Legislation Amendment (Identify and Disrupt)_
_Act. There are a range of international_
approaches which Australia could also
consider through the Strategy, recognising
these would require further consultation
to assess.

-----

###### What can Government do to improve information sharing with industry  on cyber threats?


###### Does Australia require a tailored approach to uplifting cyber skills beyond the Government’s broader STEM agenda?


###### What best practice models  are available for automated  threat-blocking at scale?


_See further questions at Attachment A._

##### Supporting Australia’s  cyber security workforce  and skills pipeline

There is no one single silver bullet for
addressing the shortage of skilled cyber
security professionals in Australia. Rather,
it requires a suite of practical actions
conducted under a clear strategy. The
Australian Government is pursuing a broad
agenda related to science, technology,
engineering, and mathematics (STEM) skills,
which will support the growth of our future
workforce, including in cyber security.
More broadly, the Government has committed
to reaching 1.2 million tech jobs by 2030.
To the extent that cyber security is
embedded in STEM curricula, this agenda
will improve the available pool of cyber
security professionals. However, it is not yet
clear whether this will be sufficient for more
specialised cyber security career pathways.
The purpose of the discussion paper is to
determine whether there are additional steps,
specific to the cyber workforce, which should
be pursued through the Strategy.


##### National frameworks to respond to major cyber incidents

It is clear that Australians expect the
Commonwealth Government to play a role
in responding to major cyber incidents.
We need to clarify what the community
and victims of a cyber attack can expect
from the Government following an incident
in the context of victim support and postincident response. Government must
ensure that frameworks for incident
management and coordination are fit-forpurpose, and conduct post-incident review
and consequence management following
major cyber incidents. It is also clear that
government should share the root cause
findings from investigations of major
cyber incidents so that we can all benefit
from these learnings. There are a range of
international models which serve as useful
comparisons, and the Optus and Medibank
incidents exposed the gaps in Australia’s
existing incident response functions.
The Strategy provides a mechanism to
improve the manner in which Australia
responds to major cyber incidents.


###### What more can the Australian Government do to support Australia’s cyber security workforce through education, immigration,  and accreditation?


-----

###### How should the Government  respond to major cyber incidents (beyond existing law enforcement and operational responses)  to protect Australians?


###### How can Government and industry work to improve cyber security best practice knowledge and behaviours and support victims of cybercrime?


###### What would an effective  post-incident review and consequence management model with industry involve?


##### Community awareness  and victim support

Despite widespread awareness of the
potential risks posed by cybercrime, there
is no consistent understanding of the
practical steps that consumers, small and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and
other organisations must take to enhance
their cyber security. There is an opportunity
through the Strategy to invest further in
community awareness and skills building
for cyber security, including for SMEs.
As with crimes which have devastating
impacts on individuals, businesses, and
communities, there is scope for Government
to explore opportunities to increase support
available to victims of cybercrime. While
preventing cyber incidents is important, it is
inevitable that major attacks will continue
to occur through to 2030 and beyond, and
Australia should assess its overall cyber
posture by viewing remediation and victim
support as a key measure of security.


##### Investing in the cyber  security ecosystem

Protective cyber security technologies
have been identified as a critical technology
by the Government, and cyber security
is essential to the secure development
and implementation of a broad range of
other critical technologies. To become
the most cyber secure nation by 2030,
Australia must create an environment that
attracts investment in cyber security and
other critical technologies.[9] There are
a range of potential measures which could
be explored to promote trade and investment
in this space, with clear opportunities
for collaboration between federal, state,
and territory governments.

-----

###### What opportunities are available for Government to enhance Australia’s domestic cyber security technologies ecosystem and support the uptake of cyber security services and technologies in Australia?


###### How should the Strategy evolve  to address the cyber security  of emerging technologies and promote security-by-design in  new technologies?


###### How should we approach  cyber security technologies  future-proofing out to 2030?


###### Are there opportunities for Government to better use procurement as a lever to support the Australian cyber security technologies ecosystem and ensure that there is a viable path to market for Australian cyber security firms?


##### Implementation governance  and ongoing evaluation

The Strategy will form the foundation of
an evolving approach to cyber security into
the future. Implementation will require strong
governance and a transparent, meaningful
evaluation framework to ensure the
Australian Government’s vision is realised,
and the Strategy is fit-for-purpose now
and into the future.


###### How should Government measure  its impact in uplifting national  cyber resilience?


##### Designing and sustaining security in new technologies

There are a number of emerging
technologies, such as quantum,
communications technologies, the Internet
of Things, and artificial intelligence which
will significantly impact, and be impacted by,
cyber security. Some of these technologies
exist now. Others will rapidly develop from
2023 to 2030 and will disrupt the existing
landscape of cyber security. The Strategy
must be adaptable to account for changes
in the strategic and technological
environment in the coming years.


###### What evaluation measures would support ongoing public transparency and input regarding the implementation of the Strategy?

## Attachment A:  Cyber Security Strategy Discussion Paper Questions


This attachment consolidates the questions for
consultation in the 2023-2030 Australian Cyber
_Security Strategy Discussion Paper and includes_
further specific detail.

Respondents may make a submission regarding
the entire discussion paper and full list of
questions, or select only those questions
which are most relevant.

1. What ideas would you like to see included
in the Strategy to make Australia the most
cyber secure nation in the world by 2030?

2. What legislative or regulatory reforms
should Government pursue to: enhance
cyber resilience across the digital
economy?

a.  What is the appropriate mechanism
for reforms to improve mandatory
operational cyber security standards
across the economy (e.g. legislation,
regulation, or further regulatory
guidance)?

b.  Is further reform to the Security of
_Critical Infrastructure Act required?_
Should this extend beyond the existing
definitions of ‘critical assets’ so that
customer data and ‘systems’
are included in this definition?

c.  Should the obligations of company
directors specifically address cyber
security risks and consequences?

d.  Should Australia consider a Cyber
Security Act, and what should
this include?

e.  How should Government seek to monitor
the regulatory burden on businesses
as a result of legal obligations to cyber


security, and are there opportunities
to streamline existing regulatory
frameworks?

f.  Should the Government prohibit the
payment of ransoms and extortion
demands by cyber criminals by:
(a) victims of cybercrime; and/or
(b) insurers? If so, under
what circumstances?

i.  What impact would a strict
prohibition of payment of ransoms
and extortion demands by cyber
criminals have on victims of
cybercrime, companies and
insurers?

g.  Should Government clarify its position
with respect to payment or nonpayment of ransoms by companies, and
the circumstances in which this may
constitute a breach of Australian law?

3. How can Australia, working with our
neighbours, build our regional cyber
resilience and better respond to
cyber incidents?

4. What opportunities exist for Australia
to elevate its existing international
bilateral and multilateral partnerships
from a cyber security perspective?

5. How should Australia better contribute
to international standards-setting
processes in relation to cyber security,
and shape laws, norms and standards
that uphold responsible state behaviour
in cyber space?

6. How can Commonwealth Government
departments and agencies better
demonstrate and deliver cyber security
best practice and serve as a model for
other entities?

7. What can government do to improve
information sharing with industry on
cyber threats?

8. During a cyber incident, would an explicit
obligation of confidentiality upon the
Australian Signals Directorate (ASD)
Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC)
improve engagement with organisations
that experience a cyber incident so as to
allow information to be shared between
the organisation and ASD/ACSC without
the concern that this will be shared with
regulators?

9. Would expanding the existing regime for
notification of cyber security incidents
(e.g. to require mandatory reporting of
ransomware or extortion demands) improve
the public understanding of the nature
and scale of ransomware and extortion
as a cybercrime type?

10. What best practice models are available
for automated threat-blocking at scale?

11. Does Australia require a tailored approach
to uplifting cyber skills beyond the
Government’s broader STEM agenda?

12. What more can Government do to support
Australia’s cyber security workforce
through education, immigration,
and accreditation?

13. How should the government respond
to major cyber incidents (beyond existing
law enforcement and operational
responses) to protect Australians?

a.  Should government consider a single
reporting portal for all cyber incidents,
harmonising existing requirements to
report separately to multiple regulators?

14. What would an effective post-incident
review and consequence management
model with industry involve?

15. How can government and industry work
to improve cyber security best practice
knowledge and behaviours, and support
victims of cybercrime?

a.  What assistance do small businesses
need from government to manage their
cyber security risks to keep their data
and their customers’ data safe?

16. What opportunities are available for
government to enhance Australia’s cyber
security technologies ecosystem and
support the uptake of cyber security
services and technologies in Australia?


17. How should we approach future proofing
for cyber security technologies out
to 2030?

18. Are there opportunities for government
to better use procurement as a lever to
support and encourage the Australian cyber
security ecosystem and ensure that there
is a viable path to market for Australian
cyber security firms?

19. How should the Strategy evolve to
address the cyber security of emerging
technologies and promote security
by design in new technologies?

20. How should government measure
its impact in uplifting national
cyber resilience?

21. What evaluation measures would
support ongoing public transparency
and input regarding the implementation
of the Strategy?
