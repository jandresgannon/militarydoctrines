## Foreword

Defending Australia, our interests and our way of life is the
enduring responsibility of the Australian Government.

However the rapid pace of technological change has
both accelerated military modernisation in the region and
reduced our strategic warning time.

There is perhaps no greater example of that than recent
advances in information and communications technology.
Defence must now be ready to fight and win in the
digital age: cyberspace has moved from an enabler
to a warfighting domain in its own right. Defence must
manoeuvre in and through this domain with greater speed
and agility to counter the increasing sophistication and
pervasiveness of the cyber threat.

Adaptive, assured, secure and accessible mission
capable information and communications technology is a
‘backbone’ for our military power.

Modern warfare is characterised by high-tempo
concurrent action in all domains. Only as a Joint Force
can we fight and win, achieved through Command and
Control, Communications and Computing, Intelligence,
Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) design. Defence
has demonstrated its strengths to meet the challenges
presented through heightened strategic tension, climate
change, global pandemics and natural disasters, and
technology has helped us seize these opportunities.

The Hon Matt Thistlethwaite MP
Assistant Minister for Defence
Assistant Minister for Veterans’ Affairs


Consequently the 2022 Defence Information and
_Communications Technology Strategy sets the direction_
for the whole-of-Defence to deliver mission capable
information and communications technology. This Strategy
includes an Action Plan to inform ongoing implementation
planning and accountabilities to achieve this. It
complements Lead the Way: Defence Transformation
_Strategy that provides clear guidance to support the_
transformation of information and communications
technology across the whole-of-Defence.

Implementation of this strategy requires a commitment to
action to respond to the challenges we jointly face, to value
information and communications technology as a critical
capability and achieve our goals.

I commend the 2022 Defence Information and
_Communications Technology Strategy to everyone involved_
in Defence, including our people, key domestic and
international partners, industry and academia.

Further, as our national security landscape changes, it is
vital that our defence force remains positioned to meet
global and regional security challenges. That is why
the Government has committed to a Defence Strategic
Review that will examine force structure, force posture
and preparedness, and investment prioritisation, to ensure
Defence has the right capabilities to meet our growing
strategic requirements.

The 2022 Defence Information and Communications
_Technology Strategy will be informed by the outcomes of_
the Defence Strategic Review to ensure that it remains
responsive to our strategic needs.

## Purpose

The 2022 Defence Information and Communications
_Technology Strategy sets out Defence’s vision for_
information and communications technology from 2022.

As a future focussed document, this Strategy considers
opportunities and threats that lie on the horizon, instead
of on today’s immediate activities or short-term plans.

Through four goals, this Strategy will shape our future
Single Information Environment (SIE)[1] to be a critical
capability in Defence. It will allow Commanders to
deliver Joint Force effects across warfighting domains.
Exchanges of trusted warfighting and battlespace
information and intelligence with allies and partners over
secure and survivable information and communications
technology will allow us to meet Defence’s strategic
objectives to shape, deter and respond.

Informed by the 2020 Defence Strategic Update, 2020
_Force Structure Plan, and Lead the Way: Defence_
_Transformation Strategy, this Strategy translates_
Defence’s strategic needs for the SIE. This Strategy is
a critical input to meeting the ambitions of the Defence
_Data Strategy 2021-2023 and provides high-level_
guidance to the Defence Cyber Security Strategy.

This Strategy is not a ‘set and forget’ document - it
provides the direction for effective planning and
transformation of the SIE as a Defence capability. The
inclusion of an Action Plan guides Defence leaders, our
allies and partners and decision makers to take action,
so that Defence can fight and win in the digital age.

1 The SIE encompasses the computing and communication infrastructure
of Defence along with the management systems and people that deliver
and sustain it.

## Strategic Context

The world is becoming increasingly complex and
connected, facing highly sophisticated and rapidly
evolving threats. Information and communications
technology is everywhere, from smartphones to military
platforms; it is fundamental to Defence. Global connectivity
is accelerating, with increasing reliance on information and
digital communication to remain competitive and excel in
everything we do. In parallel, there is an increase in the
prevalence and sophistication of cyber threats.

Information and communications technology is
no longer just an enabler. The Single Information
Environment (SIE) is a critical capability serving as the
landscape we fight in and through, as it forms part of
the Cyber domain. The SIE is an ecosystem comprising
a ‘system of systems’ that is a backbone of our military
power. Mission capable information and communications
technology integrates the operational domains of Cyber,
Maritime, Air, Space, and Land, deriving military advantage
from the ability to protect, value and exploit information to
its full potential across an integrated Joint Force.

The rate of technological change is accelerating
and keeping pace is becoming increasingly difficult.
Increased regional military modernisation, coercive tactics
in the grey-zone and the sophistication and prevalence of
cyber threats demonstrate the ability of state and non-state
actors to quickly exploit new technologies. Technology
driven change could determine the winner in a future
conflict.

The volume, size and type of data is increasing
exponentially. Storage and distribution, including the
integration, aggregation and availability of information
coupled with shorter decision cycles, presents significant
challenges. Data is a critical asset for warfighting – we must
exploit it and protect it to remain ahead of our adversaries.
It is critical for our ability to draw timely insights by
connecting data sources to achieve military advantage. Our
information and communications technology investments
and capabilities are formidable for the defence of our nation
across the conflict continuum.

The way we live and our work continue to evolve in
response to crises. The everyday need for reliable and
resilient information and communications technology to
remain productive and digitally connected to communicate
and collaborate, wherever we are, is greater than ever. The
often degraded and disconnected deployed environment,
where survivability and superiority of decision-making is
paramount, requires resilient and adaptive information and
communications technology.


A greater emphasis on self-reliance and development
of sovereign capabilities is crucial to secure Australia’s
future. The workforce, skills and experience required to
support our information and communications technology
ambitions are in high demand across the public and private
sectors, putting at risk the capacity to deliver the required
military advantage to fight and win in the digital age.

Defence is under increasing pressure to deliver
capability faster. Over the coming decade, the
Government plans capability investment in Defence,
including the Australian Signals Directorate, totalling over
$270 billion. More than $20 billion of that will be invested
in Defence’s information and communications technology,
including enterprise information and communications
technology and Information Environment and Cyber
domain capabilities. This national capability investment
recognises the increasing criticality of cyber security, to
defend Australia’s future security.

Australian Government investment in information and
communications technology is expected to deliver broader
impacts across government agencies. An ambitious digital
transformation agenda has been set: that Australia will be
one of the top three digital governments in the world
by 2025. Through this digital reform, the Government
aims to grow and streamline the delivery of information
and communications technology services for use and
reuse, improved efficiency and effectiveness. Australian
Government data and information and communications
technology, including critical infrastructure, must be a key
priority when planning, designing, delivering, using and
sustaining Defence’s information and communications
technology capabilities. Defence has a unique opportunity
to contribute to the Australian Government digital and
cyber agenda.

Defence will continue to build strong partnerships
with industry and academia to address the national
information and communications technology skills shortage
and to support the development of sovereign capability
to grow the required future workforce. We must work
together, as One Defence, to maximise the value of
information and communications technology.

## Our path to success: to fight and win in the digital age

The 2022 Defence Information and Communications
_Technology Strategy sets out four goals. The goals are_
structured to deliver Defence advantage – both military and
business.

Extracting value and insights from our data that
support faster, better decisions is key to Defence’s
decision superiority. Defence will be connected digitally
to communicate and collaborate, including with our
domestic and international partners. Information and
communications technology is the backbone that
integrates the Defence enterprise and the warfighting
domains, contributing to the capability and effects of the
Joint Force.

These priorities cannot be delivered without transforming
Defence’s information and communications technology
capability. Defence recognises the importance of
technology as an enabler, and values information and
communications technology as a capability that is
interoperable, secure, resilient and survivable, innovative
and versatile – and can scale to meet Defence’s evolving
needs and operations.

Success is underpinned by our strong alliance, industry
and Government partnerships forged to complement and
supplement our resources and capabilities and deliver force
multiplication effects.

## Goal 1: Decision superiority for Defence

##### Information and communications technology empowers Defence decision-makers with access to information and insights for faster, better decisions in the modern battlespace.


Exploiting valuable insights from our large, diverse and
disparate data is key to Defence’s military advantage,
delivering a unified operating picture and supporting
warfighters to understand the environment in which they
operate to generate the desired effects. Greater agility
is needed to deliver Joint Force-level advantage across
the competition and conflict continuum. The Defence
_Data Strategy 2021-2023 seeks to empower Defence_
to become more data-informed in its decision making.
Information and communications technology underpins this
intent. Data, no matter its source, will be securely collected,
protected, aggregated, stored and distributed across
Defence, whole-of-government and with trusted partners.
Investment in innovative and disruptive technologies, such
as robotic process automation, artificial intelligence and
machine learning will better store, move, process and
visualise data, providing timely, new insights that contribute
to Defence readiness, Command and Control (C2), and
Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR).

Adaptive architectures, underpinned by peer-to-peer
distributed networks and centralised patterns, are


survivable within a congested and contested environment
and drive warfighting capability and decision superiority.
Investment in new network types and virtual distributed
data centres will increase survivability of the Single
Information Environment (SIE) and the ability to securely
move large volumes of data to where it is needed, when it
is needed.

Information is both a weapon and a target. Grey-zone
activities in cyberspace are pervasive. Defence information
is protected and defended from capable adversaries
meeting Defence and Australia’s interests. The Defence
_Cyber Security Strategy sets the direction for Defence_
to transform cyber security practices, workforce and
investments to meet evolving cyber threats.

The right people, with the right level of data literacy and
digital skills to manage, support and extract value from our
data are as valued as those with the cyber security skills to
protect and defend the SIE.
