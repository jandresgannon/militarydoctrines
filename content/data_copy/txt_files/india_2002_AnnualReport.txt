### SECURITY ENVIRONMENT

_Keeping Vigil_


### SECURITY ENVIRONMENT


-----

1.1 India’s security concerns are defined by a
dynamic global security environment and
the perception that South Asia region is of
particular global security interest. The
continuing presence of terrorist and
fundamentalist forces in its neighbourhood
has prompted India to maintain a high level
of defence vigilance and preparedness to
face any challenge to its security.

1.2 The security challenges facing India are
varied and complex. The country faces a
series of low intensity conflicts characterized
by tribal, ethnic and left wing movements
and ideologies as also the proxy war
conducted by Pakistan and various radical
jehadi outfits through the instrumentality of
terrorism. India is also affected by the
trafficking in drugs and proliferation of
small arms and the fact that it is surrounded
by two neighbours with nuclear weapons
and missiles and history of past aggressions
and war. There is also the ever present
possibility of hostile radical fundamentalist
elements gaining access to the weapons of
mass destruction in Pakistan. The country
has experienced four major conventional
border wars besides an undeclared war at
Kargil. India’s response to these threats and
challenges has always been restrained,
measured and moderate in keeping with its
peaceful outlook and reputation as a peace
loving country.

###### NATIONAL SECURITY OBJECTIVES

1.3 India’s national security objectives have
evolved against a backdrop of India’s core
values namely, democracy, secularism and
peaceful co-existence and the national goal
of social and economic development. These
are:

l defending the country’s borders as
defined by law and enshrined in the
Constitution;

l protecting the lives and property of
its citizens against war, terrorism,
nuclear threats and militant
activities;

l protecting the country from
instability and religious and other
forms of radicalism and extremism
emanating from neighbouring states;

l securing the country against the use
or the threat of use of weapons of
mass destruction;

l development of material, equipment
and technologies that have a bearing
on India’s security, particularly its
defence preparedness through
indigenous research, development
and production, inter-alia to
overcome restrictions on the transfer
of such items;

l promoting further co-operation and
understanding with neighbouring
countries and implementing
mutually agreed confidence-building
measures; and

l pursuing security and strategic
dialogues with major powers and key
partners.

###### SALIENT FEATURES OF THE SECURITY ENVIRONMENT

1.4 India is strategically located in relation to
both continental Asia as well as the Indian
Ocean region. India’s geographical and


topographical diversity, especially on its
borders, poses unique challenges to our
armed forces in terms of both equipment
and training.

1.5 It’s peninsular shape provides India a
coastline of about 7600 kms and an
exclusive economic zone(EEZ) of over 2
million sq kms. The island territories in the
East are 1,300 kms away from the main
land, physically much closer to South East
Asia . The peninsular India is adjacent to
one of the most vital sea-lanes stretching
from the Suez canal and Persian Gulf to the
Straits of Malacca through which much of
the oil from the Gulf region transits. This
is an area which has attracted super power
rivalries in the past and continues to be a
region of heightened activity by extra
regional navies on account of current global
security concerns.

1.6 India’s size, strategic location, trade
interests and a security environment that
extends from the Persian Gulf in the west
to the Straits of Malacca in the east and
from the Central Asian Republics in the
north to near the equator in the south,
underpin India’s security response. In view
of this strategic spread, it is essential for
the country to maintain a credible  land,
air and maritime force to safeguard its
security interests.

###### THE REGIONAL PICTURE

1.7 Though there have been positive
developments in Afghanistan and Sri
Lanka, a closer look at the neighbourhood
and the wider region continues to present
a disturbing picture Many of the countries


-----

face internal instability threatening their
economic progress and peace. However,
the single greatest threat to peace and
stability in the region is posed by the
combination of terrorism nurtured in and
by Pakistan for its strategic objectives, and
the ingrained adventurism of the Pakistani
military motivated by its obsessive and
compulsive hostility towards India.
Virtually every terrorist act anywhere in the
world today has a Pakistani fingerprint
somewhere. It is the root and epicentre of
international terrorism in the region and
beyond.

1.8. Afghanistan has, with the intervention of
the international community, only just
emerged from the dark years of a
reactionary, medieval and fundamentalist
regime essentially created by Pakistan.
While the new Government has
international legitimacy, the task of
reconstruction and rebuilding the
institutions is formidable. Pakistan has a
vested interest in a weak and unstable
Afghanistan which provides it an
opportunity to meddle in the internal
affairs of the country in pursuit of its quest
for strategic depth vis a vis India and
Central Asia. Any revival of jehadi
activities supported by Pakistan is of direct
security concern to India in view of their
linkages with terrorism and the proxy war
against India. India is also committed to
international engagement in Afghanistan so
that Pakistan cannot exploit the neglect and
inattention of the international community,
as it did after the Soviet withdrawal from
Afghanistan, to sponsor jehadi politics and
training in the region


1.9 In Pakistan, fundamentalist political parties
have taken advantage of the manipulated
elections that debarred the two most
popular political leaders from contesting,
to seize power in two provincial
governments and a share in the coalition
government at the Centre. Reports and
evidence mount of both inward and
outward proliferation of nuclear weapon
technologies. Pakistan has also not lived up
to its much-publicised promises to the
international community to cease crossborder terrorism against India reversing
even those cosmetic steps that it took at the
beginning of the year, under international
pressure, against fundamentalist
organizations. Worse still, periodic
Pakistani nuclear sabre-rattling, veiled and
unveiled, has passed virtually
unreprimanded by the international
community.

1.10 In Bangaladesh too, conservative, right
wing, religious fundamentalist political
parties now have a place in the coalition
government. Pakistan continues to take
advantage of a favourable environment in
Bangladesh and of weak government in
Nepal, to promote fundamentalist thinking
and ISI activities in India in both these
countries. In Sri Lanka, the ceasefire
between the LTTE and the government is
a positive development though the LTTE
remains a potent non-state military force
that continues to arm itself, and the danger
of backsliding of the political process
remains. In Myanmar, the tussle between
the forces of democracy and the military
government remains alive.

1 11 Further west of the region the US-led war


against Iraq has generated a series of
security concerns for India notably in
relation to the security of the large Indian
community resident there, and of oil and
energy supplies. There is also a very real
risk that the US-led coalition war in Iraq
will distract attention from Pakistani
behaviour in its neighbourhood,
particularly in India but also Afghanistan,
which Pakistan will use to step up its
adventurist activities in the region as it did
after the Soviet withdrawal from
Afghanistan. The war against Iraq could
also aggravate the divide between the
Muslim and non-Muslim world.

1.12 Against this backdrop, India remains fully
committed to  maintaining peace with its
neighbours and stability in the region
through a combination of defencepreparedness and unilateral restraint,
confidence building and dialogue and
expanding bilateral interactions.

1.13 In the area of defence-preparedness, it has
reformed its higher defence management
and streamlined procurement procedures.
Its defence policy and force postures
remain defensive in orientation while its
nuclear policy is characterized by a
commitment to no-first-use, moratorium on
nuclear testing, minimum credible nuclear
deterrence, and the rejection of an arms
race or concepts and postures from the
Cold War era.

###### PAKISTAN

1.14 Pakistan’s polity has been repeatedly
hijacked by the military who have a vested
interest in tension with India as it


-----

strengthens their pre-eminence in the
Pakistani power structure. The past year
witnessed a progressive consolidation of
the role of the military, and in particular
that of General Musharraf, in the Pakistani
polity through the “referendum” of April
2002, the Legal Framework Order (LFO) of
August, the enhanced and institutionalized
role of the army in the strengthened
National Security Council of Pakistan, and
the patently manipulated elections of
October. Together with the rise of
fundamentalist MMA, these developments
do not augur well for India’s security.

1.15 India has been on the receiving end of
Pakistan’s policy of a proxy war against
India using terrorism for several decades
now, first in the Punjab and then in Jammu
& Kashmir and elsewhere. Pakistani
provocation reached a dangerous point
with the December 13, 2001 attack on the
Parliament. A more forceful response
became necessary. Additional troops were
moved along the Line of Control (LoC) and
the International Boundary in a state of
readiness, inter alia to prevent further
infiltration of terrorists into India.

1.16 In response to these measures and
international pressure, Pakistani President,
General Pervez Musharraf announced in
a speech on January 12, 2002, that
“Pakistan will not allow its territory to be
used for any terrorist activity anywhere in
the world”, that “no organization will be
allowed to indulge in terrorism in the name
of Kashmir” and that “anyone found
involved in any terrorist act would be dealt
with sternly” There was a temporary


crackdown on extremists in Pakistan.
Terrorist groups such as Jaish-eMohammed and Lashkar-e-Tayyaba were
banned and some of their financial assets
were frozen. Some leaders were placed
under house arrest and around 2000 lowlevel cadres of terrorist organizations were
arrested.

1.17 There was a temporary decline in cross
border infiltration and terrorist violence
linked to it in the months of January-March
2002 while ‘jehadi’ cadres were advised to
lie low. However, cross border infiltration
and terrorist violence continued and
increased as the measures were relaxed
with time. On May 14, 2002, terrorists
attacked family lines of an army camp in
Kaluchak, Jammu district, killing 32
civilians including 11 women and 11
children. On May 18, 2002, India asked the
Government of Pakistan to recall their High
Commissioner in New Delhi in view of
Pakistan’s continued support to cross
border terrorism. Once again, under
pressure, General Musharraf responded in
his speech of May 27, 2002 with a
commitment to stop cross border
infiltration and terrorism on a permanent
basis.

1.18 Despite General Musharraf’s commitments, cross border infiltration and related
terrorist violence increased from July 2002
onwards. On July 13, 2002 Pak-based
terrorists attacked a low-income
neighbourhood in Qasimnagar. Attacks on
soft targets calculated to inflame sentiments
have continued . These include the attacks
on temples at Akshardham and in Jammu


and on women in J&K. As recently as on
March 20, 2003, Kashmiri Hindus living in
Nadimarg, Jammu were targeted in which
24 Pundits, including 11 women and 2
children were massacred in cold blood.
These incidents underscore once again that
there has been no respite in terrorism from
Pakistan. They also underline the need for
Pakistan to take decisive steps to end
infiltration on a permanent basis and wind
down the infrastructure of support to
terrorism.

1.19 Cross border infiltration and linked
terrorist violence reached a height in the
run up to the Jammu & Kashmir Legislative
Assembly election. However, the successful
conduct of elections to the Jammu &
Kashmir Assembly with a voter
participation of 43.70% in the face of
terrorist threats and intimidation, and
public satisfaction with the results, was
seen as a vindication of the desire of the
people of Jammu & Kashmir for peace and
of the credibility of the elections.

1.20 On October 16, 2002, the Government
decided to re-deploy the troops from
positions on the international border as the
Armed Forces were deemed to have
achieved the immediate objectives assigned
to them. It was also decided that there
would be no lowering of the vigil in Jammu
& Kashmir.

1.21 India remains firmly committed to the
path of dialogue and reconciliation in
keeping with the Simla Agreement and the
Lahore Declaration and  has repeatedly
called upon Pakistan to end its sponsorship


-----

of terrorism in India so that a  conducive
environment can be created for the
resumption of bilateral dialogue. Should
Pakistan move purposefully towards
eradicating cross border terrorism, India
will  be prepared to resume bilateral
dialogue  to  address  differences  and
enhance  cooperation. It should not be
forgotten that the two most bold and
meaningful initiatives for dialogue at
Lahore and Agra came from India.

###### CHINA

1.22 China, India’s largest neighbour, is passing
through a period of rapid economic growth
and modernization with the aim of
achieving great power status in the shortest
time possible. India’s border with China is
almost 3,500 km long. China continues to
occupy approx. 38,000 sq. km of Indian
territory mainly in the Aksai Chin Area,
and claims yet another 90,000 sq km in the
Eastern Sector. Further, 5,180 sq. km of
territory under Pak occupation in Northern
Kashmir was illegally ceded to China by
Pakistan in 1963. (Whilst several rounds
of Border Talks have been held with China,
a number of disputed pockets remain).

1.23 China is rapidly modernising its Armed
Forces. In its White Paper on National
Defence issued recently, China has stressed
the vital importance of maintaining
international stability and a global strategic
balance, as also a legal regime governing
international arms control and disarmament,
in order to address an international situation
that is undergoing profound changes
including a serious disequilibrium in the


balance of military power especially between
the developed and developing countries. As
reported by the Chinese Government to the
16[th] National Party Congress in November
2002, strengthening of national defence is a
“strategic task in China’s modernization
drive”.

1.24 As far as India is concerned, it cannot be
ignored that every major Indian city is
within reach of Chinese missiles and this
capability is being further augmented to
include Submarine Launched Ballistic
Missiles(SLBMs). The asymmetry in terms
of nuclear forces is pronouncedly in favour
of China and is likely to get further
accentuated as China responds to counter
the US missile defence programme. China’s
close defence relationship with Pakistan
takes a particular edge in view of latter’s
known belligerence and hostility to India
and its acquisition of nuclear assets.

1.25 Notwithstanding these concerns, India
continues its endeavour to seek a long term
and stable relationship with China, based
on the principles of Panchsheel, mutual
sensitivity to each other’s concerns and
equality and is committed to the process
of dialogue to resolve all outstanding
differences. Some Confidence Building
Measures(CBMs) have been initiated and
while these are bearing fruit incrementally,
the pace of progress has been less than
satisfactory. A number of high level visits
have taken place in recent years. The
President of India visited China in the year
2000. This was followed by Mr. Li Peng’s
visit to India in January 2001. These high
level visits have improved bilateral


relations and understanding of each other’s
viewpoint thereby contributing to further
reduction in tension.

1.26 Important developments marking the
progress of India-China relations in 2002-03
included the initiation of direct Delhi-Beijing
flights, the first meeting of the India-China
dialogue mechanism on counter terrorism,
the completion of the process of exchange
of maps for clarification of the Line of Actual
Control (LAC) in the Middle Sector, the
implementation of the MOU (signed during
Premier Zhu’s visit) on sharing hydrological
data from the upper reaches of the
Brahmaputra and accordance of ‘Approved
Tourist Destination Status’ to India by China.
The Joint Working Group on the Boundary
Question met in its 14[th] session in November
2002. The first informal Foreign Minister
level India-China-Russia dialogue took
place in September 2002 on the sidelines of
the UNGA. Interaction in other agreed
dialogue mechanisms also continued.

1.27 India has, of late, commenced some
cooperation with the armed forces of
China. Naval Ships of both the countries
have been exchanging visits and some of
India’s mid level officers are undergoing
courses in Chinese institutions. During
2002-2003, exchange of high level defence
delegations continued.

###### OTHER NEIGHBOURS

 BANGLADESH

1.28 India’s relation with Bangladesh is
characterized by both affinity and
occasional friction Key security concerns


-----

relate to the problem of uncontrolled
migration,  which Bangladesh refuses to
recognize, across the 4,000 kms common
boundary, the presence and activities of
Indian insurgent groups and leaders from
the north-east of India on Bangladeshi soil
which it refuses to acknowledge, the rising
influence of political parties and
organizations of radical Islamic and
fundamentalist orientation within and
outside the coalition government led by the
Bangladesh National Party, and border
demarcation and border management
problems which give rise to ugly incidents
from time to time. Border management
problems, such as smuggling, illegal
immigration, insurgency, trafficking of
women and children, and the construction,
repair and maintenance of boundaryrelated structures are addressed through
Border Coordination Conferences between
the Border Security Force (BSF) and
Bangladesh Rifles (BDR) while issues such
as exchange of enclaves and adverse
possessions are addressed by the Joint
Boundary Working Groups (JBWGs)
constituted for the purpose. Following the
elections, India continued with its policy
of close engagement with its eastern
neighbour discussing all issues in a
forthright manner.

###### NEPAL

1.29 Relations between India and Nepal have
consistently been close and extensive,
reflecting the historical, geographical,
cultural and linguistic links between the
two nations. In keeping with this close
relationship several high-level interactions


took place between India and Nepal.
Defence relations too have been
traditionally close.

1.30 During the year, Nepal was beset on the
one hand by a political and  constitutional
crisis and on the other, by a growing Maoist
insurgency and violence that had spread
to almost all the districts of Nepal, with
mid-West to Western districts as thrust
areas.

1.31 Another area of growing concern for India’s
security is the increased activities of Pak
ISI and terrorist organizations amongst
Nepal’s Muslim minority.

###### SRI LANKA

1.32 The ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka has, over
the years, extracted a severe political and
security cost for India, internally and
externally, that goes beyond the
assassination of a former Prime Minister
through a terrorist act and serious
casualties incurred by the Indian Armed
Forces in an effort to ameliorate the
situation. It has created the possibility for
countries hostile or unfriendly to India to
establish a foothold there in a manner
inimical to India’s security interests. The
LTTE remains a proscribed terrorist
organization in India and its leader, a
proclaimed offender under the law.

1.33 The keystone of the Government of India’s
policy towards the ethnic conflict in Sri
Lanka is a firm commitment to the unity,
sovereignty and territorial integrity of Sri
Lanka and to the restoration of a lasting
peace through a peaceful negotiated


settlement that meets the just aspirations
of all elements of Sri Lankan society. On
the political front, India continues to
support the activities of the Sri Lankan
Government towards the Peace Process.
The Government of India welcomed the
ceasefire agreement stating that it would
provide an opportunity to both sides to
move forward towards a substantive
dialogue for a negotiated political
settlement of the ethnic conflict.

###### MYANMAR

1.34 Myanmar remains an area of security
interest for India not only on account of the
activities of north-eastern insurgent groups
that have set up camps across the Indian
border, but also because of the activities of
countries working against India’s
legitimate security concerns and the
repercussions of the tussle between the
forces of democracy and military
government on these interests. India
welcomes the greater openness of the
Myanmar government in its external
relations, and steps towards political
reconciliation, internally.

###### BHUTAN

1.35 India shares a relationship based on close
friendship, good neighbourliness and
mutual trust with Bhutan underpinned by
a strong and diverse mutually beneficial
partnership in the sphere of economic and
social development, and a tradition of highlevel visits.

1.36 Traditionally, Bhutan has been sensitive
and mindful of India’s security concerns


-----

The two countries continue to be in close
touch with each other on the issue of
presence of ULFA-Bodo militants in
Southern Bhutan.

###### AFGHANISTAN

1.37 India is closely watching the changing
scenario in Afghanistan since it has
ramifications on the security scenario of the
region and the country, including in the
state of Jammu and Kashmir. India would
not like to see Afghanistan once again
becoming a breeding ground for terrorism,
or a victim of terrorism sponsored from
across its borders. India was amongst the
first countries to appoint a Defence Attaché
in Kabul. India-Afghanistan ties continued
to expand and strengthen during the year.

1.38 In general, the situation in Afghanistan has
improved. However, the security situation
in crucial parts of Afghanistan is still not
stable. Two senior ministers have been
assassinated. Armed clashes have been
taking place between different groups in
Northern and Western Afghanistan. Of
particular concern are the signs of the
regrouping of the Taliban and Al Qaeda
remnants and the forces of Gulbuddin
Hekmatyar in the southern and eastern
Afghanistan.

###### CENTRAL ASIAN REPUBLICS (CARS)

1.39 The strategic map of Central Asia has
changed almost unrecognisably since the
disintegration of the former Soviet Union.
Post Cold War, it has become a theatre of a
new ‘great game’ not only because of its
strategic location but also its natural


resources, notably oil and natural gas. Since
9/11, it has also acquired a new layer of
strategic interest because of its vantage
point vis-à-vis the central security concerns
of the region namely terrorism in its local,
regional and global aspects. Pakistani
vanguards, including the ISI are widely
viewed as continuing their destabilizing
activities of recruiting and training
fundamentalist elements and encouraging
radical movements in the Central Asian
Republics. This has the twin objectives of
extending their influence in the region and
promoting anti-India activities. Major
players are actively using defence
diplomacy to advance their interests.

1.40 Central Asia is an area of vital importance
to India not only on account of its
geographical proximity and India’s
historical and cultural links with the region,
but also because of the common challenge
they face from jehadi terrorism. Relations,
based on a shared commitment to open and
progressive societies, secularism and
democracy, have been reinforced by
similarity of views in the fight against
terrorism. India and countries of Central
Asia also share views with regard to
checking the menace of drugs trafficking.

1.41 Relations with Central Asian countries
have been informed by a shared interest in
mutual benefit and all round growth.
Economic relations are showing steady
improvement. Raksha Mantri visited
Tajikisthan in April 2002 and Uzbekistan
in February 2003. Other senior level visits
also took place. In the sphere of defence,
cooperation is taking the form of a security


dialogue and training of armed forces
personnel many of whom are presently
undergoing courses in Indian defence
training establishments.

###### THE ASIA-PACIFIC

1.42 Reverberations of religious fundamentalism
and terrorism were heard in parts of South
East Asia too especially in Indonesia where
a blast in October 2002 took toll of about
one hundred tourists in Bali.The Bali
bombings focussed international attention
on South East Asia as a nodal point in
international terrorism and an emerging hub
of militant Islam. This prompted the US to
step up its military presence in, and
assistance to the region and to seek
alternative solutions to the problem of
terrorism ranging from cooperative security
to controversial pre-emptive  doctrines.
Elsewhere   in   Asia,   the  stand-off on
DPRK’s   nuclear    programme  set off
alarms regarding DPRK’s nuclear intentions
and the source of some of its nuclear
technologies.

1.43 Given that India shares maritime
boundaries with some of the countries of
the South East Asia and is within the
periphery of the Asia-Pacific, these
developments have relevance for India.
Keeping this in view, India has initiated
discussions with the governments
concerned on terrorism and related issues
such as trafficking in drugs, people and
small arms, piracy etc. At the IndiaASEAN Summit in Phnom Penh in
November 2002, the Prime Minister
conveyed India’s decision to subscribe to


-----

the ASEAN Declaration on Terrorism, and
also willingness to enter into a similar
declaration on India-ASEAN cooperation
in this field.

1.44 Defence cooperation relationships with
countries of South East Asia and the Pacific
have been growing steadily focussing
mainly on exchanges of high-level visits,
strategic dialogues, port calls, training
exchanges and some sourcing of defence
equipment. Prospects of their further
development are good. Mechanisms for
defence cooperation already exist with
Malaysia, Vietnam, Indonesia, Australia
and Laos, and more are under process of
conclusion. The 4[th] Malaysia-India Defence
Committee meeting held in September
2002 and the 2[nd] India-Australia Strategic
Dialogue held in March 2003 provided
opportunities to discover new areas of
convergence and cooperation in security
matters. Defence exchanges between India
and Japan and also the ROK reflected the
mutual recognition that strengthened
cooperation between them was a positive
factor for maintenance of peace and
stability.

###### WEST ASIA / GULF

1.45 India’s security environment is closely
linked to that of the neighbouring West Asia
region. As a member of the international
community, India has been gravely
concerned with the vicious cycle of violence
and counter-violence and the consequent
serious deterioration of the security
situation in West Asia and has repeatedly
called for de-escalation of tensions


1.46 In the Persian Gulf, the growing tension
between the US and Iraq finally exploded
into war on March 20, 2003 with the failure
of diplomatic efforts under the auspices of
the UN Security Council. The full political
and security implications are still to unfold
and will take some time to assess, but it
would be safe to assume that they will be
far reaching in terms of their strategic
impact.

###### EUROPE

1.47 India’s relations with the European Union
and individual member countries in the
field of defence and security cover a broad
spectrum of activities including training
exchanges, joint exercises and defence
procurement, production and R&D. A
mechanism for a security dialogue exists
with France at the highest executive levels.
Mechanisms for defence cooperation also
exist with the UK and Italy. Fresh
agreements on defence cooperation
providing for an enhanced level of
cooperation were signed with Italy and
Poland in February 2003 during the visits
of the Italian Defence Minister and the
Polish Prime Minister to India. Defencerelated exchanges have also been
expanding with other countries in Europe
like Germany, the Czech Republic, Ukraine
and Belarus. Cooperation with Europe on
defence procurement and production could
be greater still if it were not for mechanisms
that introduce uncertainties in the
fulfillment of contracts on extraneous
political grounds. The evolving relationship
with France shows that there is a good
potential for a path-breaking defence

industrial relationship in areas of advanced
technologies cutting across the normal
pattern of North-South relations as
epitomized during the visit of the Prime
Minister of France to the Aero India Air
Show in Bangalore in February 2003.

###### RUSSIA

1.48 Indo-Russian relations pursued a steady,
all-round and strategic course during the
year covering the gamut of political,
defence, security and economic fields. The
two sides continued to deepen their
consultations on strategic and mutual
security concerns.

1.49 Bilateral defence cooperation was fortified
through several meetings and visits by the
high dignitaries of the two countries. Raksha
Mantri visited the Russian Federation from
April 10-13, 2002. The third session of the
Inter-Governmental Commission on
Military Technical Cooperation (IGC-MTC)
was held in Moscow in January 2003, cochaired by Raksha Mantri and the Minister
of Science and Technology and Industry of
the Russian Federation Mr. Ilya Klebanov.
Discussions covered acquisition, licensed
production, R&D, product support and new
areas and forms of cooperation in the
defence field.

###### UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

1.50 Following the end of the Cold War and in
response to the changing international
environment, Indo-US relations are
undergoing a qualitative transformation.
Cooperation and consultations have


-----

broadened and diversified considerably. Both
the countries have recognised that closer
Indo-US relations would be an important and
a positive factor both for stability of the region
as well as in the global affairs.

1.51 There has been a significant progress in
defence and security relationship between
India and the United States during last
year. As part of the enhanced bilateral
engagement on these matters, there were
several important bilateral visits and
meetings in the context of cross-border
terrorism by Pakistan, and in pursuit of a
shared objective of building a strategic
relationship. With a view to accelerating the
pace of Indo-US defence cooperation, the
apex level Defence Policy Group (DPG) met
for a second time in May 2002 after its
resumption in December 2001. Apart from
the DPG, bilateral Executive Steering
Groups of the Army, Navy and Air Force,
the Security Cooperation Group (to
advance a defence supply relationship) and
the Joint Technical Group (to advance R &
D collaboration in defence) have also been
meeting or are scheduled to meet. The two
countries have conducted mutually
beneficial combined exercises in India and
United States besides stepping up training
exchanges.

1.52 The terrorist attacks in the United States on
September 11, 2001 and on the Parliament
on December 13, 2001 have led to a
deepening of Indo-US cooperation in
combating international terrorism.

###### TERRORISM

1 53 India has been a victim of terrorism for


many decades, much before the West
experienced its deadly reality on September
11, 2001. The terrorist menace in Jammu
and Kashmir has its roots in Pakistan and
is supported financially and materially by
the government and institutions of that
country. The Indian Armed Forces have
dealt with the problem of cross-border
terrorism with a multi-pronged strategy
that includes psychological warfare,
innovative military tactics and counter
intelligence methods. These efforts have


met with reasonable success but this is a
prolonged battle. India’s long experience in
tackling terrorism can be of valuable help
to other countries that are facing similar
challenges now.

1.54 For any terrorist movement to be contained,
the Government’s resolve and the security
forces’ firmness are a must. India’s fight
against terrorism has been a long and
arduous one and the Indian Armed Forces
are fully geared to handle any problem that


_Ready with N.B.C. protective gear_

may arise in future. It is important that the
state support for any form of terrorism
must cease. Terrorist organisations have
long arms and global reach. The world,
therefore, has to fight a united battle by
pooling resources in order to remove this
scourge from the face of the earth.

###### INDIA’S NUCLEAR POLICY

1.55 India remains a firm and consistent
proponent of general and complete
disarmament and attaches the highest
priority to global nuclear disarmament.
India’s policy on disarmament also takes
into account changes that have taken place
in the world, especially in the 1990s. The
nuclear tests of May 1998 do not dilute
India’s commitment to this long-held
objective. As a nuclear weapon State, India
is even more conscious of its responsibility
in this regard and, as in the past, continues
to take initiatives in pursuit of global
nuclear disarmament both individually and
collectively. The steps that were announced
after the tests, and the initiatives that India
has taken since, strengthen this
commitment.


1.56 India’s nuclear weapons capability is meant
only for self-defence and seeks only to
ensure that India’s security, independence
and integrity are not threatened in the
future. India is not interested in a nuclear
arms race. This is the rationale behind the
two pillars of India’s nuclear policy –
minimum deterrence and no-first use.The
determination of the profile of this
deterrent, including accurate and refined
delivery systems, is a sovereign
responsibility.

1.57 After concluding the series of tests of
May 1998, India announced a voluntary
moratorium on further underground
nuclear test explosions. In announcing
this moratorium, India accepted the core
obligation of a test ban and also
addressed the general wish of the
international community to foreswear
testing. This moratorium continues,
subject to the supreme national interests,
a provision granted under the CTBT to
every country. India has also announced
its willingness to move towards a de jure
formalisation of this voluntary
undertaking.


###### PLANNING CONSIDERATIONS

1.58 The security environment that has been
highlighted above clearly brings out four key
elements that are fundamental determinants
of our security planning. These are:

(a) the Indian Armed Forces have a two
front obligation, which require them to
safeguard the security of our borders
with Pakistan as well as with China;

(b) India is not a member of any military
alliance or strategic grouping, nor is
this consistent with our policies
necessitating a certain independent
deterrent capability;

(c) due to external abetment, India’s
Armed Forces are involved in
internal security functions on a
relatively larger scale than is normal
requiring a force structure that will
be able to cope with it; and

(d) India’s interests in the North Indian
Ocean, including the security of our
EEZ and Island territories, highlight
the need for a blue water Naval
capability commensurate with our
responsibilities.

### ORGANISATION AND FUNCTIONS OF THE MINISTRY OF DEFENCE

_T-90(S) Tank on display at Republic Day Parade, 2003_


-----

###### HISTORICAL BACKGROUND

2.1 A Military Department was created in the
Government of the East India Company at
Calcutta in the year 1776, having the main
function to sift and record orders relating
to the Army issued by various Departments
of the Government of East India Company.
The Military Department initially
functioned as a branch of the Public
Department and maintained a list of Army
personnel.

2.2 With the Charter Act of 1833, the Secretariat
of the Government of East India Company
was reorganised in four Departments,
including a Military Department, each
headed by a Secretary to the Government.
The Army in the Presidencies of Bengal,
Bombay & Madras functioned as respective
Presidency Army till April 1895, when the
Presidency Armies were unified into a
single Indian Army. For administrative
convenience, it was divided into four
Commands viz., Punjab (including the
North West Frontier), Bengal, Madras
(including Burma) and Bombay (including
Sind, Quetta and Aden).

2.3 The supreme authority over the Indian
Army vested in the Governor General-inCouncil, subject to the Control of the
Crown, which was exercised by the
Secretary of State for India. Two Members
in the Council were responsible for military
affairs, one of whom was the Military
Member, who supervised all administrative
and financial matters, while the other was
the Commander-in-Chief who was
responsible for all operational matters. The
Military Department was abolished in


March 1906 and it was replaced by two
separate Departments, the Army
Department and the Military Supply
Department. In April 1909 the Military
Supply Department was abolished and its
functions were taken over by the Army
Department. The Army Department was
redesignated as the Defence Department in
January 1938. The Department of Defence
became the Ministry of Defence under a
Cabinet Minister in August 1947.

###### POST-INDEPENDENCE ORGANISATIONAL SET-UP AND FUNCTIONS

2.4 On August 15, 1947, each Service was
placed under its own Commander-inChief. Under the Constitution, the
Supreme Command of the Armed Forces
vests in the President. In 1955, the title of
Commander-in-Chief was abolished and
the three Service Chiefs were designated
as the Chief of the Army Staff, the Chief of
the Naval Staff and the Chief of the Air
Staff. In November 1962, a Department of
Defence Production was set up to deal
with research, development and
production of defence equipment. In
November 1965, the Department of
Defence Supplies was created for planning
and execution of schemes for import
substitution of requirements for defence
purposes. These two Departments were
later merged to form the Department of
Defence Production and Supplies. A
Scientific Adviser to the Defence Minister
was appointed to advise him on scientific
aspects of military equipment, research


and design of equipment used by the
Defence forces. In 1980, the Department
of Defence Research and Development was
created.

2.5 The Armed Forces are primarily
responsible for ensuring the territorial
integrity of the nation. The Ministry of
Defence, provides policy framework and
wherewithal to the Armed Forces to
discharge their responsibility in the context
of the defence of the country.

###### DEPARTMENTS

2.6 The Ministry of Defence consists of three
Departments, namely, Department of
Defence, Department of Defence
Production & Supplies and Department
of Defence Research & Development.
The Defence Secretary functions as head
of the Department of Defence and is
additionally responsible for coordinating the activities of the three
Departments in the Ministry. The
principal functions of all the
Departments are as follows:

(i) The Department of Defence deals
with the three Services and various
Inter-Service Organisations. It is also
responsible for the Defence Budget,
establishment matters, defence
policy, matters relating to Parliament,
defence co-operation with foreign
countries and co-ordination of all
activities.

(ii) The Department of Defence
Production and Supplies is headed
by a Secretary and deals with


-----

matters pertaining to defence
production, indigenisation of
imported stores, equipment and
spares, planning and control of
departmental production units of
the Ordnance Factory Board and
for Defence Public Sector
Undertakings (DPSUs).

(iii) The Department of Defence Research
and Development is headed by a
Secretary, who is also the Scientific
Adviser to the Raksha Mantri. Its
function is to advise the Government
on scientific aspects of military


equipment and logistics and the
formulation of research, design and
development plans for equipment
used by the Services.

2.7 The Finance Division of the Ministry of
Defence is headed by Secretary Defence
(Finance). He exercises financial control
over proposals involving expenditure
from the Defence Budget and is
responsible for internal audit and
accounting of defence expenditure. In
the latter tasks, he is assisted by the
Controller General of Defence Accounts
(CGDA).


###### COMMITTEES

2.8 A number of Committees dealing with
defence related activities assist the Raksha
Mantri. He holds weekly meetings which
are attended by the Defence Secretary,
Secretary (Defence Production & Supplies),
Scientific Adviser to Raksha Mantri,
Secretary Defence (Finance), Principal
Secretary to the Prime Minister, Cabinet
Secretary, Foreign Secretary and the Chiefs
of Staff of the three Services to review
important developments and discuss issues
concerning national security.

2.9 The Chiefs of Staff Committee is a forum in
which the Service Chiefs discuss matters
having a bearing on the activities of the
Services and advise the Ministry. The position
of Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee
devolves on the longest serving Chief of Staff,
and consequently rotates amongst the three
Services. To facilitate the work of the Chiefs
of Staff Committee, a number of subcommittees have been established.


2.10 The principal task of the Ministry is to obtain
policy directions of the Government on all
defence and security related matters and
communicate them for implementation to the
Services Headquarters, Inter-Service
Organisations, Production Establishments
and Research & Development Organisations.
It is also required to ensure effective
implementation of the Government’s policy
directions and the execution of approved
programmes within the allocated resources.
A list of items dealt with by the Departments
in the Ministry of Defence is given in
_Raksha Mantri in Forward Area_ Appendix-I to this report.


-----

components. Some of the major reforms are
detailed in the following paragraphs.

2.16 **Integrated Defence Staff : A decision**
regarding the recommendation of the
Group of Ministers for creation of the Chief
of Defence Staff (CDS) has not been taken
by the Government as yet pending
consultation with political parties.
However, with a view to ensure higher
degree of jointness amongst the Services
and attempt inter-service and intra-service
prioritization, the Government has set up
the Integrated Defence Staff, headed by the
Chief of Integrated Staff to Chairman,
Chiefs of Staff Committee (CISC), to
support the Chiefs of Staff Committee and
its Chairman in the optimal performance
of their roles and functions. The CISC
supervises the Integrated Defence Staff,
chairs all multi-Service bodies and the
Defence Crisis Management Group
(DCMG) and is also responsible for the
coordination of long-range plans, five year
plans and annual budgetary proposals of
the three Services in consultation and coordination with the Integrated Services
Headquarters. The CISC renders advice to
the Government on prioritization for
developing force levels and capabilities
through restructuring proposals,
undertakes net assessment comprising the
totality of the national capability,
formulates joint doctrines in consultation
with Service Headquarters, conceptualises
policy and programmes on joint planning
and military education for personnel of
Defence Services, render advice for
evolving responses to non conventional


2.11 The three Services Headquarters, viz., the
Army Headquarters, the Naval
Headquarters and the Air Headquarters
function, under the Chief of the Army Staff
(COAS), the Chief of the Naval Staff (CNS)
and the Chief of the Air Staff (CAS)
respectively. They are assisted by their
Principal Staff Officers (PSOs). The InterServices Organisations, under the
Department of Defence are responsible for
carrying out tasks related to common needs
of the three Services such as medical care,
public relations and personnel management
of civilian staff in the Defence Headquarters.

2.12 Information regarding the Ministers in the
Ministry of Defence, the Chiefs of Staff, the
Secretaries in the three Departments of the
Ministry and the Secretary Defence
(Finance) who held positions from April 01,
2002 onwards is given in Appendix-II to
this report.

###### REFORMS IN MANAGEMENT OF DEFENCE

2.13 The broad array of challenges both existing
and potential to the national Security in the
fast changing geo-strategic security
environment mandate a periodical reappraisal of our security procedures to cope
with them. The Government, keeping this
in view, had instituted a comprehensive
review of the National Security System in
its entirety for the first time in the history of
independent India. The review was carried
out by a Group of Ministers(GOM)
constituted on April 17, 2000. The GOM
consisted of the Home Minister the Raksha


Mantri, the External Affairs Minister and the
Finance Minister. The Group of Ministers
set up four Task Forces one each in the areas
of (i) Internal Security; (ii) Border
Management; (iii) Intelligence Apparatus;
and (iv) Management of Defence, which
were multi-disciplinary in character and
comprised of acknowledged experts, to
facilitate its tasks. The recommendations of
the Group of Ministers, which aim at
integration of the civil and military
components and ensuring ‘Jointness’ and
‘Synergy’ among the Armed Forces, were
approved by the Government on May 11,
2001.

2.14 The Report of the GOM in so far as
‘Management of Defence’ is concerned
included amongst others, measures such as
creation of the Chief of Defence Staff(CDS),
creation of a Defence Procurement Board,
a Defence Production Board, a Defence
R&D Board, preparation of holistic and
integrated Defence Perspective Plans for
15-20 years, establishment of a National
Defence University, effective media
management, establishment of Andaman &
Nicobar Island Command and Strategic
Forces Command, integration of Service
Headquarters with the Ministry of Defence
and delegation of higher administrative
and financial powers to the Services.

2.15 The process of implementation of the
recommendations made by the Group of
Ministers regarding reforms in Defence was
initiated in 2001. These reforms have
brought about improvements in the
organizations, structures and processes for
the integration of civil and military


-----

and unconventional threats to national
security and proposes measures to be taken
for ensuring the required jointness amongst
the Armed Forces and enhancing the
efficiency and effectiveness of the planning
process through intra and inter-Service
prioritization.

2.17 **Defence Intelligence Agency : The**
Government has also set up the Defence
Intelligence Agency (DIA) under DG DIA
to co-ordinate and synergise the
intelligence Wings of the Services. The DIA
is responsible for providing integrated
intelligence inputs to the higher echelons
of Defence Management.

2.18 **Defence Acquisition Council : The**
Government has set up a Defence
Acquisition Council headed by the Raksha
Mantri for decision making in regard to the
totality of the new planning process, which
_inter-alia_ involves according ‘in principle’
approval of capital acquisitions in the long
term perspective plan and according ‘in
principle’ approval for each capital
acquisition programme. The decisions
flowing from the Defence Acquisition
Council are to be implemented by the
following three Boards:
(i) **Defence Procurement Board headed**
by the Defence Secretary;

(ii) **Defence Production Board headed**
by the Secretary (Defence Production
& Supplies); and

(iii) **Defence Research & Development**
**Board headed by Secretary (Defence**
Research & Development).


These Boards have been entrusted with
specific functions. A Defence Acquisition
**Wing** headed by Special Secretary
(Acquisition) has also been created to assist
the Defence Procurement Board in its
functioning.

2.19 The new structures are intended to
facilitate expeditious decision-making in
an integrated manner in areas relating to
acquisitions for the three Services while
at the same time imparting a higher
degree of transparency and cost
effectiveness to the process of acquisition
of equipment, weapon and weapon
systems.

2.20 **Defence Technology Council (DTC) :**
Defence Technology Council has been
constituted under the Chairmanship of
Raksha Mantri by the Government to
provide guidance and supervision of
growth and promotion of research,
development and production related to
Defence Technologies. DTC will assist the
Defence Acquisition Council in taking
holistic decisions on specific Defence
Projects related to long term perspective
plans and five year plans.

2.21 **Andaman and Nicobar Command** **: The**
first tri-Service Joint Command was
established in October 2001 in Andaman
and Nicobar under the Commander-inChief (C-in-C) who exercises control over
all force components of the three Services
and the Coast Guard located in Andaman
and Nicobar Islands. The C-in-C,
Andaman and Nicobar Command reports


to the Chairman, Chiefs of Staff
Committee.

2.22 **Management of Strategic Assets :**
Keeping in view the nuclear, chemical
and biological dimensions of our security
environment and in keeping with our
commitment to no first use of strategic
assets, the Government has approved
establishment of requisite structures for
administering the Strategic Assets and
also set up the Strategic Forces
Command.

2.23 **Delegation of Administrative and**
**Financial** **Powers** **:** Various
administrative and financial powers
have been delegated to the Integrated
Service Headquarters to impart
enhanced autonomy in their functioning.
Decentralisation of decision-making
powers has strengthened and upgraded
the decision-making apparatus in the
Services. With higher delegation of
financial powers, greater efficiency and
cost effectiveness with accountability has
brought about the transparency desired
in the system of defence related
expenditure.

###### DEFENCE EXPENDITURE

### INDIAN ARMY

_Infantry and Armour — A Deadly Combination_


-----

3.1 The primary task of the Army is to
safeguard the territorial integrity of the
nation against external threats. Our
military capabilities are directed towards
ensuring the defence of our territory. In
addition, Army is called upon, as and when
necessary, to assist civil administration
during internal disturbances to maintain
law & order, as well as to organize relief
operations during natural calamities such
as floods, earthquakes, cyclones etc. The
Army has been structured, equipped and
trained to fulfil its primary task and to
accomplish other tasks assigned to it.

###### OPERATION ‘PARAKRAM’

3.2 The Armed Forces were mobilized in
December, 2001, to thwart the active
promotion of cross border terrorism and
posturing by Pakistan. After the Armed
Forces achieved their objectives they were
re-deployed in October, 2002 from positions
on the international border with Pakistan
without impairing their capacity to respond
decisively to any emergency and without
lowering of vigil in Jammu & Kashmir.

######  MODERNISATION OF WEAPON SYSTEMS AND EQUIPMENT

3.3 During the year various measures and
projects were implemented to modernize
and upgrade the weapons & weapon
systems of the Army to enhance its
combat efficiency as also to address the
requirements of modern day warfare.
The more notable of such measures of
each area are indicated in the succeeding
paragraphs.


(i) **Armoured Corps: T-90 tanks were**
inducted. These tanks are state of the
art and have night vision capability
and advanced armour protection.
Trials of thermal imagery based
sighting and fire control system were
conducted with a view to equip the
existing T-72 tanks. Image Intensifier
night vision devices for the existing
T-55 tanks were also trial evaluated.

(ii) **Artillery: A new class of multi-barrel**
rocket launching system was
introduced. The existing 130 mm
field guns are being upgraded to
155mm. A new class of weapon
locating radars were also contracted
and there was introduction of various
types of more accurate, terminally
guided ammunition and projectiles.

(iii) **Infantry: A major exercise was**
initiated to reorganize the infantry
battalion for optimum utilization
of combatant manpower and
enhancement of combat efficiency.
The infantry units were provided
with various advanced types of
grenade and rocket launchers as well
as Ground Position Receiver System.

(iv) **Air Defence Artillery: Army has**
successfully developed in-house, a
simulator system ‘Drona’, for indoor
& cost-effective training of soldiers
for improving marksmanship on
various weapons.

(v) **Signals: Special emphasis was laid**
on equipping the forces with the
latest, suitable and effective


communication system, particularly
for counter insurgency operations.
The equipment include radio sets
with frequency hopping and
encryption facility, High Frequency
and Very High Frequency set for the
mechanized forces & infantry and
wide band radio relay sets for point
to point communication. A secure
network of Very Small Aperture
Terminal was commissioned for
reliable and stable communication in
the forward areas. The Phase-III of
Army Static Communication
Network was initiated, which is
planned to eventually extend to
Kashmir Valley and the North East.

(vi) **Engineers: Production of Assault**
bridges, hitherto imported, have been
indigenised under the guidance and
support of Defence Research &
Development Organisation. The
‘Sarvatra’ bridge manufactured
indigenously is qualitatively superior
to its percurser, the imported

_Tank T-72 in Action_


-----

AM-50 bridge set. To match the
increasingly advanced types of
improvised explosive devices (IED)
employed by terrorists and antinational elements, particularly in the
insurgency prone areas, state of the
art counter IED equipment is being
procured and issued to units
deployed in such areas.

###### COUNTER INSURGENCY OPERATIONS Jammu & Kashmir

3.4 The steady pressure of counter
insurgency operations maintained in J&K
by the Army, as also the Rashtriya Rifles,
along side other security forces has been
able to keep the security situation in the
State from deteriorating further. The
strategy of the Army has been to
dominate the Line of Control and thus
minimize infiltration of terrorists from
across the LOC. Cross LOC infiltration
did show a somewhat downward trend
especially during the first half of the year
but infiltration picked up during the
latter part of the year, particularly prior
to and during the J&K elections.
Terrorists continued to make attempts to
infiltrate across the LOC and several such
attempts were foiled by the Army. In the
hinterland, the Army, in synergy with
other security forces, has been able to
contain the activities of insurgents. The
impact of operations of the Army and
other security forces was most visible in
the successful conduct of elections in
J&K, despite threats of terrorist violence


and serious and sustained efforts by the
terrorists to intimidate the people of J&K
and disrupt the election process,
including through attacks on election
rallies and killing of political figures. The
celebration of the 54[th] Republic Day, with
enthusiastic participation from the people
of the State was also held across the State
in district headquarters all over J&K,
including in the Kashmir valley.

###### North-East

3.5 The magnitude of the decades old
situation of insurgency in the North East
has de-escalated considerably. The visible
signs of peace and tranquility in Nagaland


are a direct result of the cease-fire with
both factions of National Socialist Council
of Nagaland (NSCN), the oldest insurgent
group in the North East. This, along with
the peace talks held with the Bodo
Liberation Tigers (BLT) bode well for the
region. Operations by the security forces
against other insurgent groups in the
region have marginalized the latter
considerably.

3.6 Salient aspects of the prevalent security
environment in the North East are given
below in brief:

(a) **Assam :  Sustained military**
operations by the Security Forces


_Vigil from the Tree Top-Nagaland_


-----

under the Unified Headquarters have
met with success resulting in the near
marginalisation of the United
Liberation Front of Assam (ULFA)
and National Democratic Front of
Bodoland (NDFB). Heavy attrition
has been inflicted on ULFA’s cadres
by security forces.

(b) **Nagaland : The cease-fire with**
National Socialist Council of
Nagaland (IM) effected since August
1997 has been extended by another
year. Government had also entered
into a cease-fire agreement with
NSCN(K) w.e.f. April 2001. The
general situation in the State has
continued to be peaceful despite
sporadic incidents of unlawful
activities by the two factions of
NSCN.

(c) **Manipur :  The situation in the State**
has been generally under control and
the valley based insurgent groups
have maintained a low profile.
However, there have been continuing
turf wars between various groups,
notably between the UNLF –
NSCN(K) combine and NSCN(IM).

(d) **Tripura :  Operations conducted by**
the Security Forces in Tripura have
resulted in large number of
surrenders by activists of National
Liberation Front of Tripura and All
Tripura Tigers Force. Owing to
these operations, activities of both
these groups have been largely
contained.


###### UN PEACEKEEPING OPERATIONS

3.7 Peacekeeping Operations under the over all
aegis of United Nations have grown in
relevance and importance. India is one of
the largest contributor of troops and
materials for UN Peacekeeping Missions.
Officers and troops contingents of the
Indian Army have been actively involved
in Peacekeeping Missions in  Lebanon,
Ethiopia-Eritrea, Democratic Republic of
Congo, Angola and Kuwait as given below
in brief :
(a) **Lebanon : One Indian infantry**
battalion group as well as staff
personnel, comprising 651 personnel,
are deployed as peacekeepers in the
UN Interim Force in Lebanon
(UNIFIL). The Force Commander of
the Mission is an Indian Army officer.

(b) **Ethiopia-Eritrea:** An Indian
contingent, comprising an Infantry
Battalion, a mechanized company,
an Engineer company and personnel
from Corps of Signals, Army
Medical Corps, Electrical and
Mechanical Engineers and Army
Education Corps, has been deployed
for the Peacekeeping Operations in
Ethiopia and Eritrea (UNMEE).
Indian Army is one of the largest
troops contributor in this Mission
with 1548 personnel. The
Engineering Construction Company,
has performed commendably by
taking on variety of developmental
work in the entire area of
responsibility of UNMEE. In both
UNIFIL and UNMEE the Indian


contingents have been giving
humanitarian assistance and
medical aid to the local populace,
earning considerable goodwill and
international appreciation.

(c) **DRC (Congo): There are forty Indian**
Army officers serving as military
observers in the UN mission in DRC
(Congo) (MONUC).

(d) **Kuwait: Eight Indian Army officers**
were serving as military observers in
the UN Iraq Kuwait Observer
Mission (UNIKOM), till February.

###### RASHTRIYA RIFLES

3.8 Ever since its raising in 1990, Rashtriya
Rifles, a para military force under the
operational control of the Army, has
emerged as the main specialized force to
counter proxy war and insurgency in the
Jammu & Kashmir. Six additional
battalions of Rashtriya Rifles were
sanctioned during the year raising the force
strength to fifty-four battalions.
Operational performance of Rashtriya
Rifles has been exemplary, with high
motivational level of troops and good
administration. However, success in proxy
war and counter insurgency has not been
without its cost, with many gallant officers
and men of Rashtriya Rifles having made
the supreme sacrifice in the relentless
pursuit of the given objective.

3.9 Rashtriya Rifles troops have undertaken a
number of goodwill missions in their
respective areas. These include running of
schools providing medical aid and


-----

organizing friendly matches between Army
and locals. There has been overwhelming
response from the civilian population with
respect to such programmes which has
generated a lot of goodwill for Rashtriya
Rifles troops.

###### TERRITORIAL ARMY

3.10 A total of thirty-five units of the Territorial
Army (TA) were embodied and mobilized
for Operation PARAKRAM. This included
thirty-one non-Departmental and four
Departmental units of TA.

3.11 The Committee constituted to review the


TA as well as a Task Force on Management
of TA, set up by the Government, have
submitted its recommendations.

###### TRAINING

3.12 A Junior Leaders Academy, for training
of junior commissioned officers and non
commissioned officers in the army, the
second such institution for the army, was
sanctioned this year for raising at
Ramgarh. This academy is proposed to
be eventually shifted on a permanent
basis to Anandpur Sahib, Punjab.


###### ADVENTURE & SPORTS ACTIVITIES

3.13 **Airborne Africa – 2002** **:** Exercise
Airborne Africa – 2002, an International
airborne combat readiness competition was
held in Botswana from June 01 to 15, 2002.
A total of 28 teams representing 12
countries from different continents
participated in the competition. Two teams
represented the Indian Army from 10
PARA (Special Forces). The competition
involved a grueling schedule requiring the
teams to traverse a distance of more than
80 kilometers in the Northern part of
Kalahari Desert over three days and
included events such as Endurance March,
Cross Country Navigation, Casualty
Evacuation, Home Run and Combat
Shooting. The two Indian teams led from
the front securing first and second positions
in the Endurance March, and also top
honours in other events as well.

3.14 **Sailing Regatta 2002 : “Sail the Gulf”**
Regatta is a prestigious championship
held at Doha under the aegis of the Doha
Sailing Association. In the Sailing
Regatta 2002, there were a total of 100
boats representing 21 countries from all
over the world. At this Regatta Nb
Subedar Rajesh Choudhary of the Corps
of Electrical and Mechanical Engineers
represented India in the Laser Class Sail
Boat Event. India won the current title
and also won five out of the seven races
sailed.


3.15 **Antarctic Expedition : The Army’s**
involvement commenced with the second
_Raksha Mantri Meeting Jawans During Operation Parakram_
expedition in 1982 83 when a small


-----

contingent of three officers, including a
medical officer, formed part of the
expedition. Ever since then, the Army has
been intimately involved in the conduct of
these expeditions every year. Army’s
participation in these expeditions mainly
involves assisting the Department of Ocean
Development. This primarily involves :
(a) Construction of permanent stations.

(b) Repair, maintenance and extension of

### INDIAN AIR FORCE

_SU-30 MK-1_


-----

Bangalore, Hindustan Aeronautics Limited
(HAL) and other indigenous agencies are
involved in most of these projects. The
Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH) has
been inducted in the Indian Air Force.
Upgrade of HS-748 is underway and
contract for modification of the remaining
aircraft is in final stages.

###### ACHIEVING TECHNOLOGICAL EDGE

5.5 The IAF is in the process of equipping all
aircraft with the basic Electronic Warfare
(EW) suite. Indigenous development of EW


5.1 The responsibilities of the Indian Air Force
(IAF) are multifarious. They range from air
defence of the nation to providing
reconnaissance, battlefield airstrikes and
counter air operations during hostilities.
The security environment of South Asia
necessitates building and maintaining
credible deterrence capabilities against
threats from the north and the west. In
contemporary wars/hostilities, air power
application would precede any operation.
Hence air superiority is a mandatory
prerequisite to success in any land and sea
battle. Alongside these responsibilities, the
IAF undertakes peacetime operations like
assistance to civil administration during
natural calamities and transporting
personnel for maintenance of law and
order. It also meets the requirements of
troops guarding border outposts on the
high ranges of Himalayas, the deserts of
Rajasthan and the inaccessible regions of
the North East.

5.2 Keeping in view the challenges of the
future technology-intensive warfare and
the necessity for optimal utilization of
resources, the IAF has embarked upon a
modernization programme through new
induction of aircraft systems, force
multipliers and upgrade of old workhorses
and weapon systems to keep pace with the
emerging technologies. It has maintained
its equipment and ensured high standards
of professionalism.


21 Bis UPG aircraft has been inducted into
the IAF and is operational. Development
of Su-30 MK-I aircraft has been completed
and all the aircraft of phase-I have been
delivered. The Hon’ble Raksha Mantri
formally inducted the Su-30 MK-I aircraft
on September 27, 2002.

5.4 The Jaguar Navigation and Weapon
Aiming Sub-System (NAVWASS) aircraft
are slated to be upgraded next year. Details
of the proposal for upgrade of the MiG-29
fleet are being worked out. Defence
Avionics Research Establishment (DARE),


5.3 The induction of the Light Combat Aircraft
(LCA) is expected to take place soon. The
upgraded MiG-21 Bis aircraft (Bison) now
packs a lethal punch. A squadron of MiG _Mirage 2000 back from mission_

5.13 **Media Utilisation: Media is an important**
factor, in portraying the desired image of an
organisation. IAF has taken steps to project
correct image of itself and its activities. A
film named ‘Akash Yodha’ was produced
in 2001-02. In order to improve awareness
about careers in IAF, the Air Force career
website has been operationalised at
**www.careerairforce. nic.in. Since then there**
has been a 10% increase in the number of
volunteers applying for the posts in Indian
Air Force in 2002.

###### METEOROLOGY

5.14 The IAF participated in Arabian Sea
Monsoon Experiment (ARMEX), sponsored
by Department of Science & Technology, as
a part of Indian Climate Research
Programme from June to August. The
routine observational data was passed to
Operation Centre at National Centre for
Medium Range Weather Forecast
(NCMRWF), New Delhi in real-time. The
IAF provided two modified An-32 aircraft
for this experiment. A team of IAF
meteorological personnel and scientists from
Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology
(IITM), Pune were flown in each of the
missions to record atmospheric parameters
such as temperature profile, wind profile,
aerosol composition, electrical conductivity
of air and video mapping of cloud
imageries. Twenty such missions were flown
totaling 87 hours of flying effort.

###### TRAINING

5.15 **Recognition of Training/Courses: The**
Director General Civil Aviation (DGCA)


equipment is also being processed.
Procurement of additional support
equipment for Mirage-2000 to enhance its
capability is under progress. Upgrade of
Mi-35 helicopter is being serially carried
out to enhance its overall capabilities.

###### FLIGHT SAFETY

5.6 A number of Streak Shadow micro light
aircraft have been inducted for survey of
bird activities in the extended local flying
areas. The drive for clearance of vegetation
and implementation of anti-bird measures
is being vigorously pursued. Operational
Safety Management workshops are being
conducted by Directorate of Flight Safety at
all major air bases and Base Repair Depots
(BRD) to indoctrinate aircrew and officers
of all branches to actively participate in
reducing Human Error (HE) accidents.

###### FORCE MULTIPLIERS

5.7 Force multipliers such as Air-to-Air
Refuellers (AAR) are being inducted to
enhance the Radius of Action (ROA) of the
strike aircraft and loiter time of the Air
Defence (AD) aircraft.

###### INFORMATION WARFARE

5.8 **Space Applications: Space and space**
assets being vital part of the nation’s war
fighting capability, IAF made significant
progress by using space technologies in the
field of communications, surveillance &
reconnaissance and search & rescue. With
the launch of satellite IRS-TES, India now
has enhanced capabilities in imagery


INSAT series of satellite is used for
communications, while IRS series is used
for imaging.

###### SURVEILLANCE AND EARLY WARNING

5.9 **Aerostat Based Surveillance Systems:**
Aerostat based surveillance systems are
being acquired to provide gap-free lowlevel radar coverage in the western and
southern sectors.

_March Past by Coast Guard_

(b) **Operation Swan : In the year**
1993, consequent to the Mumbai
serial bomb blast, large scale
smuggling of arms and explosives
was reported through sea,
adjoining Maharashtra and
Gujarat coasts. To counter this,
Operation Swan was launched in
co–ordination with Navy in April
1993 to patrol sensitive areas off
the West Coast. This operation


appears to have contained the
situation to a large extent.

(c) **Operation Nakabandi : With**
increased hostilities in Sri Lanka,
influx of Tamil refugees have
commenced again. Local fishermen
have started smuggling diesel and
other explosive making material. To
check the influx of refugees and to
curb the clandestine activities in Palk
Bay and Gulf of Mannar, Operation
Nakabandi was launched on August
13, 1996 and is continuing.

(d) **Anti Smuggling Operations : Based**
on intelligence inputs from
Department of Customs and
Department of Revenue Intelligence,
Coast Guard undertakes antismuggling operations. In addition,
random anti-smuggling patrols are
also conducted. Due to Coast Guard
patrolling, incidents of smuggling
contraband have come down
drastically.

(e) **Search** **and** **Rescue** **(SAR)**
**Operations : Coast Guard ships and**
aircraft undertook various Search
and Rescue missions and were
instrumental in saving 87 lives at sea
after receipt of distress messages
from International Maritime Coordination Centre (INMCC),
Bangalore. This has strengthened the
Search and Rescue responses in the
Indian Ocean under the new Global
Maritime Distress System (GMDSS)
operation. The major SAR operations
are detailed below: 

(i) **Search and Rescue Assistance**

launched off Orissa Coast with a view to
protect the endangered species of Olive
Ridely turtles. Coast Guard ships and
aircraft continue to be deployed during
November - May each year for protection
of the turtles. As a result of intensified
patrolling by Coast Guard ships, fishing
activities in the restricted area gets reduced
considerably.

6.10 **Interception of adrift Merchant Vessel** **:**
A Merchant Vessel Al-Murtada was
reported adrift off Ratnagiri on July 3, 2002.
A Coast Guard Dornier aircraft and a ship

evacuated the patient on board and
provided urgent medical assistance. The
patient was thereafter, admitted to local
hospital for emergency treatment.

###### COMMUNITY INTERACTION

6.15 While the Coast Guard carries out its
duties as per charter, there are certain
unwritten requirements of all national
organisations to fulfil certain national
goals towards development and the
greater common good. With this in mind,
the Coast Guard has initiated a
Community Interaction Programme with
the fishing and coastal community and the
school children. Fishermen are given talks
on safety at sea, action in distress, carrying
of life jackets, radio frequencies on their
transistors, rule of the road etc. In
addition, certain sports programmes, such
as volleyball or tug of war and inter
village sports are being arranged. School
children are given talks on the sea,
shipping environment and maritime
awareness A sea cadet corps station is


being started in Daman, which will be
followed by units at smaller places, such
as, Tuticorin, Mandapam, New
Managalore and Paradip. Coast Guard
ships have adopted an island each in the
Lakshadweep where the doctor conducts
OPD for a few hours.

###### USE OF HINDI

### DEFENCE PRODUCTION AND SUPPLIES

_Aero-India Show 2003_


-----

7.6 Defence Public Sector Undertakings and
Ordnance Factories have exported items
worth Rs.114.05 crore up to December 31,
2002 against the annual target of Rs. 232.63
crore for the year 2002-2003.

###### SUPPLIES WING

7.7 With a view to achieving self-reliance in the
vital sector of Defence, the Department has
been endeavouring to indigenise defence
equipment wherever technologically
feasible and economically viable. It has
been a part of our indigenisation effort to
locate and develop broad-based indigenous
supply sources both in the public sector as
well as in the civil trade for many
sophisticated and complex equipment.
There has been a significant change in the
role of private sector/civil trade in the field
of indigenisation, i.e., from the role of
supplier of raw-materials, components,
sub-systems, they have now become
partners in the manufacture of complete
defence equipment/ systems. The defence
industry sector, which was so far reserved
for the public sector, has now been opened
up for participation by the Indian private
sector. The Indian companies are now
eligible to apply for license to set up
defence industry for manufacture of all
types of defence equipment. Such
companies can also have foreign direct
investment, upto 26% of their equity. This
is a watershed in the history of Defence
Production. Detailed guidelines have
already been issued by the Department of
Industrial Policy & Promotion (DIPP) in
consultation with the Ministry of Defence
setting out the modalities for consideration


7.1 Department of Defence Production was set
up in 1962, in the aftermath of the Chinese
aggression to create a self-reliant and selfsufficient indigenous Defence production
base. In November 1965, Department of
Defence Supplies was created to forge
linkages between the civil industries and
Defence production units. The two
departments were merged in December
1984 into the Department of Defence
Production and Supplies.

7.2 Since 1962, 16 new Ordnance Factories
have been set up. Their capacities have
been augmented and modernised
selectively keeping in mind the emerging
requirements of the Armed Forces. All the
Ordnance Factories and Defence Public
Sector Undertakings (DPSUs) are engaged
in the task of manufacture of equipment
and stores for Defence Services. One more
Ordnance Factory is being set up at
Nalanda, Bihar. In addition, the capacities
of civil sector are also utilised for the
purpose. The following DPSUs are
functioning under the administrative
control of the Department :
(i) Hindustan Aeronautics Limited
(HAL)

(ii) Bharat Electronics Limited(BEL)

(iii) Bharat Earth Movers Limited(BEML)

(iv) Mazagon Dock Limited (MDL)

(v) Goa Shipyard Limited (GSL)

(vi) Garden Reach Shipbuilders and
Engineers Limited (GRSE)

(vii) Bharat Dynamics Limited(BDL)


(viii) Mishra Dhatu Nigam Limited
(MIDHANI)

7.3 In addition, the following organisations are
also associated with the Department of
Defence Production and Supplies for
technical support:
(i) Directorate General of Quality
Assurance (DGQA)
(ii) Directorate of Standardisation
(iii) Directorate General of Aeronautical
Quality Assurance (DGAQA)
(iv) Directorate of Planning and Coordination
(v) Defence Exhibition Organisation (DEO)

7.4 These Defence production units have
become self reliant, progressively.
Additional capacities have been built up
and new items have been productionised.
These include the main battle tank Arjun,
the Advanced Light Helicopter(ALH) and
a range of 155 mm ammunition.

7.5 The total value of issues by Ordnance Factories
and Defence Public Sector Undertakings
during the last three years, is as follows:

-----

of applications for grant of license. During
the year twelve applications from private
sector have been considered by the
Department for grant of Letters of Intent.

7.8 For indigenisation of spares of defence
equipment, an institutional framework has
been in existence in the form of 8 Technical
Committees, comprising of officers from the
Directorate General of Quality Assurance.
Each Committee is headed by a Technical
officer of the rank of Major General/
Brigadier or equivalent. These committees
maintain a compendium of civil industries
capable of undertaking the task of
indigenisation of defence equipment / stores
after conducting surveys and assessing their
capabilities. After identifying items in
consultation with the user services for
indigenisation and keeping in view the
commercial viability and the strategic needs,
these Committees take up indigenisation
activities and ensure timely supply of
defence equipment/stores.  Government
has taken a decision in February, 2002 that
in future indigenisation work would be the
responsibility of Production Agencies like
Ordnance Factories & Defence PSUs and
Service Headquarters.

7.9 With the objective of encouraging civil
industry for indigenous development of
Defence stores, a scheme of National
Award for Excellence in indigenisation
was introduced in the year 1993-94. The
efforts made by the Industry in
substituting inputs of defence equipment
& stores are duly recognized by the
Department and deserving units are
presented with suitable awards.


7.10 To help the civil sector familiarize itself
with the requirements of Armed Forces,
permanent sample rooms are maintained
in the four metropolitan cities. For
facilitating greater and more meaningful
interaction, conferences/exhibitions are
organised from time to time in
collaboration with civil industry. During
the year 2002-2003 (upto December, 2002)
six exhibitions were conducted at various
locations throughout the country.

7.11 In the year 2001-2002, Supply Orders were
placed for ab-initio development of 1405
items along with 4 systems/sub-systems.
During 2002-2003, 778 items were taken up
for development upto 31.12.2002.

###### ORDNANCE FACTORIES

7.12 Ordnance Factories are an integrated base for
indigenous production of defence hardware
& equipment and function under the
Department of Defence Production &
Supplies. Defence production is highly
specialized, complex and poses unique
challenges. Products have to be safe, reliable,
consistent in quality and capable of operating
under varying terrains as well as climates and
under extreme conditions. Accordingly, the
technologies applied, which cover a wide
spectrum of engineering, metallurgy,
chemical, textile, leather and optical
technologies, should ensure high quality and
productivity, apart from meeting the primary
objective of self-reliance. Apart from
supplying armaments to Armed Forces,
wherever adequate capacities are available,
the Ordnance Factories also fulfil the
requirements of Paramilitary & Police


Forces/Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) for
arms, ammunition and clothing etc. Thus, the
Ordnance Factories endeavour to enhance
their capacity utilization not only by securing
work load from the defence forces but also
through sustained efforts in diversification to
non-defence customers and exports.

7.13 The Indian Ordnance Factories
Organisation completed 200 years of its
existence on March 18, 2002. The Ordnance
Factories Organisation is a fine blend of the
old and the state-of-the-art factories with
the first Ordnance Factory established in
1801 at Cossipore, near Kolkata and the 40[th]

factory being set up with state-of-the-art
technology at Nalanda, Bihar for
production of Bi-modular Charges. The 40
Ordnance Factories are geographically
distributed all over the country at 25
different locations. The pre-independence
factories had capacities created not only for
production of finished stores, but also had
in-house facilities integrated backwards for
supply of basic and intermediate materials,
for which indigenous industrial
infrastructure in the civil sector was then
inadequate. In respect of the factories set
up after Independence and with gradual
emergence and development of civil
industrial infrastructure in public and
private sector, the concept of backward
integration was progressively given up and
the emphasis shifted from production of
basic intermediate inputs to production of
finished stores by drawing upon supplies
from the civil sector for raw-materials,
components and semi-finished goods to the
extent practicable.


-----

7.14 **Organisation :** The structure of the
Ordnance Factory Organisation was
changed in 1979 to promote cohesive,
effective and coordinated functioning, based
on the recommendations of an expert and
high-powered committee (Rajadhyaksha
Committee). The Ordnance Factory Board
(OFB) was accordingly formed with Director
General Ordnance Factories (DGOF) as
Chairman and 9 Members in the rank of
Additional DGOF; one member being from
the Finance stream.

7.15 Presently, Ordnance Factories are divided
into 5 operating groups/divisions, based
on the main products/technologies
employed; these are:

� Ammunition & Explosives

� Weapons, Vehicles and Equipment

� Materials and Components

� Armoured Vehicles and

� Ordnance Equipment Group of
Factories.

7.16 A member/Addl. DGOF heads each of the
above group of factories. The remaining
four Members are responsible for staff
functions, viz. Personnel, Finance, Planning
& Material Management, Projects &
Engineering and Technical Services.

7.17 A Special/Extended Ordnance Factory Board
provides for representation of the Army,
Defence Research & Development
Organisation and Ministry of Defence. The
Special Board meetings are held periodically
to provide appropriate inputs and
perspectives for planning resources,
upgrading technology of products and


process and on various other critical issues
necessary for the efficient functioning of OFB.

7.18 **Product Profile and Technology :** The
Ordnance Factories continuously upgrade
their products and the manufacturing
technologies to meet the emerging needs
of Defence Forces. The facilities and
capacities in the Ordnance Factories produce
a wide range of arms and ammunitions for
the Infantry, Artillery and Armoured Corps
of the Army; Navy and the Air Force. The
factories produce Military Transport
Vehicles, Infantry Combat Vehicles,


Armoured Vehicles, Optical and Optoelectronic instruments, summer & winter
uniforms, parachutes, miscellaneous leather
goods and general stores etc. Facilities also
exist for design & manufacture of special
purpose machine tools for captive use in the
production of arms & ammunition.

7.19 A major thrust is being given in
Ordnance Factories to achieve optimum
capacity utilization not only by securing
increased workload from the Defence
Forces but also through sustained efforts

in diversification to non-defence
customers and exports.

7.20 **Growth : The sales of Ordnance Factories**
have been steadily growing over the years.
A record total sales of Rs.6105 crore was
achieved during 2001-2002 representing an
increase of about 8.9% over the preceding
year’s sales of Rs. 5608 crore. In 2002-2003,
the sales of Ordnance Factories are
expected to be higher at Rs. 6502 crore.
Ordnance Factories have endeavoured to
keep pace with the development in arms,
ammunition and other equipment by
updating/upgrading technology either
through Defence Research and
Development Organisation or through
transfer of technology (TOT) route.

7.21 The Ordnance Factories have also steadily
increased their sales to non-defence
customers, including exports. During 20012002, 12.4% (Rs 756 crore) of the total sales
of the Ordnance Factories was to nondefence customers. This represents a 25.2%
growth over the previous years’ sales to
non-defence customers (Rs 604 crore). In
2002-2003, the sales to non-defence
customers are expected to be much higher
at Rs.874 crore.

7.22 **Highlights :** Some of the significant
achievements of Ordnance Factories in last
few years have been as follows:
(i) While all the thirty nine Ordnance
Factories( 40[th] being set up) have
been accredited with Quality
Management Systems (ISO
9002:9004), five Ordnance Factories
have also been accredited IS/ISO


9001:2000 quality system, which is an
upgraded version that gives special
emphasis on customer satisfaction
and continued improvement in
Quality and Process Control. Apart
from the five Ordnance Factories
already accredited with IS/ISO
9001:2000, two more Ordnance
Factories have been recommended
for IS/ISO 9001:2000 accreditations.

(ii) The increased capacity utilization
saw the defence forces benefit by way
of reduced prices. The year 2001-2002
saw a 3.00% reduction in the average
weighted price of Ordnance
Factories. During 2002-2003, the
average weighted price has been
further reduced by another 1.01%.

(iii) Ordnance Factory Project, Medak
(OFPM) has established new method
of proof firing Carrier Mortar Track
(CMT) Vehicles. This will increase the
proof firing capacity by three times.

(iv) Rifle Factory, Ishapore (RFI) has
developed and established production
of a state-of-the-art 0.22” Revolver, a
new weapon for personal safety. The
development and manufacture of this
Revolver was completed in less than
a year, and the Revolver was formally
launched on 17.6.2002.

(v) In line with the international trend to
upgrade existing equipment, since it
is economical to upgrade the existing
equipment such that it matches the
performance of the new equipment,
Ordnance Factories are in the process


of producing 155 mm upgraded
equipment for the Army.

(vi) Ordnance Factories are going to
establish Radial Forging Facilities for
production of heavy caliber gun
barrels. This is a state-of-the-art plant
available only in a few countries.

(vii) Opto Electronics Factory, Dehradun
(OLF) obtained accreditation for its
Optical Calibration Laboratories from
the National Accreditation Board for
Laboratories (NABL).

(viii) Ordnance Factory, Nalanda is a green
field project conceived for
manufacture of Propellant Charges for
155 mm weapon systems at Rajgir in
Nalanda district of Bihar. An area of
2700 acres has been acquired and civil
works have commenced at the site.

(ix) The T-90 Main Battle Tanks have been
inducted into the Indian Army and
its indigenous production is planned
in the Ordnance Factories. The
activities pertaining to establishment
of indigenous production is
progressing in full swing and the first
indigenously produced T-90 tank is
expected to roll out during 2003-2004.
The induction of T-90 tanks is
expected to increase the strike
capability of the Indian Army.

7.23 **Self Certification in Ordnance Factories :**
Continuing their commitment to quality,
and in line with the practices prevailing in
industry, both within and outside the
country, Ordnance Factories have started
self-certification since 1.4.2002, thereby,


-----

standing guarantee to the products
supplied by them to the Defence Forces.
Presently, self-certification extends to seven
fast moving clothing & general store items
accounting for about 20% of the turnover
of the Ordnance Equipment Group of
factories. In course of time, more items will
be covered under self-certification.

7.24 **In-house Research and Development**
**Activities : In-house Research &**

10.14 A new system of recruitment has been
introduced with effect from April 1, 1998.
Under the revised system, recruitment of
jawans in the Army is carried out through
open recruitment rallies only. Recruitment
rallies are planned well in advance,
keeping in view the geographical,
demographical and topographical
considerations. At least one such rally is
held in each month combining districts,
areas and regions, depending upon the
response anticipated, thereby giving every
aspirant, irrespective of his place of
residence, minimum one opportunity in a
year to get himself enrolled in the Army.
In the old system of Branch Recruiting


Office-oriented recruitment, aspirants had
to travel long distances to reach the nearest
BRO for enrolment, whereas in the revised
system, recruitment has been brought
closer to their area of domicile. Advance
publicity regarding an ensuing rally in a
particular area/district is given by putting
up hoardings, advertisement in local
newspapers, radio etc.

###### PUBLICITY FOR RECRUITMENT

10.15 Measures have been taken to make the
youth of our country more aware of the
opportunities in the Army, both for officers
including women officers and Other Ranks
categories. The means of publicity adopted
to attract better talent are as follows:

(a) **Press Advertisements: Advertise-**
ments are released through the
Directorate of Advertising and Visual
Publicity (DAVP) in the Employment

Technical Graduate Course, Short
Service Commission (Technical and
Non-Technical), University Entry
Scheme, Law Graduates, Induction in
Medical Services for both men and
women, Special Entry Scheme

**Magazines: These are normally**
brought out in the journals/
magazines of educational institutions.

(c) **Hoardings: Hoardings are erected at**
ZRO/BRO premises as well as
adjacent to Engineering Colleges all
over the country to attract technical
talents into the Army. DAVP
approves the sites and, thereafter, the
hoardings giving detailed information
are installed and maintained by them.

International Trade Fair, New Delhi, a
stall is established where information
regarding recruitment is provided to
visitors. This is also done in other
organized fairs, which are career
oriented and meant for students.

###### IMAGE PROJECTION CAMPAIGN

10.16 To meet out the shortage of officers and
bring out awareness of the opportunities
that are available on commissioning in the
Army amongst the target group (youths),


an advertising campaign was launched in

professional advertising agency to project
positive aspects of a wholesome career
available to Service Officer. The aim of the
campaign was to reach out to every corner
of the country through the print, audio,
visual and audio-visual media. An

It is popularly known as CIJW School. The


-----

10.67 Pre-induction training in these schools has
benefited all the units, as they were able to
understand the peculiarities of the
insurgency problem in their locality.
Besides training for counter insurgency,
these schools especially in the Northern
Command are training units for their role
along the line of control and in high altitude
areas. Performance of these schools can be
gauged from the favourable results
achieved by Army in combating internal
insurgency and infiltration along the line
of control and International Border.

###### COLLEGE OF DEFENCE MANAGEMENT

10.68 Realisation of the necessity to set up an
institution devoted to imparting modern,
scientific management training was felt
sometime after the Indo-Pak War of 1965.
The size of the Indian Defence Services,
their deployment in far flung areas, high
cost of equipment, limited resources, socioeconomic changes, all necessitated that
military commanders be exposed to
modern management concepts and
techniques to enable them to operate in an
effective and optimum manner. Such skills
could neither be imparted from within the
existing framework of training in the
Armed Forces nor could they be borrowed
from the civilian management stream. This
need felt by the services gave birth to the
Institute of Defence Management (IDM) at
Secunderabad in June, 1970. The IDM was
renamed as the College of Defence
Management(CDM) in 1980.

10 69 The College shifted to its new campus in


of the Indian Army. The origin of the
institution can be traced back to the year
1885. Infantry School is located at two
places. The Weapon Wing and Young
Officers Wing are located at Mhow. The
Junior Leaders Wing consisting of
Commando and Platoon Commanders
Wing is located at Belgaum.

10.62 The institution imparts training to the
Officers, JCOs and ORs of not only infantry
but other arms and services besides Para
Military Forces and Civil Police
Organisations. A number of friendly
foreign countries are making use of the
facilities. During the current training year
90 Officers, 160 JCOs/NCOs from friendly
foreign countries attended the courses.
With this backdrop, the institution is
presently training 1195 Officers, 5900
JCOs/NCOs in a year.

10.63 The School is responsible for the following
activities:
(a) developing new tactical doctrines,
battle techniques and battle drills
pertaining to infantry and
introducing them;

(b) continuously studying and keeping
abreast with tactical and technical
developments in India and abroad;

(c) carrying out trials of weapons,
equipment and ammunition
pertaining to infantry;

(d) conducting courses of instruction; and

(e) training Army Shooting Team and
the National Shooting Team in
“Precision Shooting”.


10.64 Courses : Eleven courses are conducted at
Infantry School (including Junior Leaders
Wing) viz. Young Officers Course, Ghatak
Course, Platoon Weapon Course, Mortar
Course, Anti Tank & Guided Missile
Course, Platoon Commanders Course,
Medium Machine Gun & Automatic
Grenade Launcher (J/N) Course, Section
Commanders Course, Automatic Data
Processing Course, Sniper Course and
Battalion Support Weapon Course.

10.65 Army Marksmanship Unit : The School
also has the Army Marksmanship Unit
which has produced a large number of
champion shooters at national and
international level.

###### BATTLE SCHOOLS

10.66 Due to escalation of insurgency problem in
J&K and in the East, a need was felt to
impart pre-induction training to all units
being inducted into counter insurgency
environment. Capacity of CIJW School was
limited. Besides due to peculiar operational
situation and administrative problems of
movement of units, it was necessary to
impart training to units in areas closer to
their operation areas. To overcome these
problems, the following three Theatre
Battle Schools were established:
(i) Battle School at Kheru for units
moving into the Kashmir Valley;

(ii) Battle School at Sarol for units
moving into Chamba and adjoining
areas near Jammu; and

(iii) Battle School at Thakurbari for units
moving into Assam and Meghalaya

_Ex-servicemen Contingent in Republic Day Parade_


-----

11.1 In order to maintain a youthful profile of
the Armed Forces, approximately 60,000
service personnel are retired/released
every year at a comparatively young age.
Majority of service personnel at the time
of retirement are at an age where they have
numerous unfinished domestic
responsibilities which necessitate their
taking up of a second occupation. As per
statistics maintained, a total of **17,47,637**
Ex-Servicemen (ESM) and 3,54,597 widows
have been registered and reported to be
surviving as on **June 30, 2002. The Ex-**
Servicemen population is mainly
concentrated in the States of Uttar Pradesh,
Punjab, Haryana, Maharashtra, Kerala,
Tamil Nadu, Rajasthan, and Himachal

Government posts. These include
reservation of vacancies/relaxation in age
and educational qualifications, exemption
from payment of application/examination
fees, priority employment to disabled Ex

of Assistant Commandants in Para
Military Forces are also reserved for ExServicemen. In addition, most of the State
Governments, except for the States of UP,
Bihar, J&K, Kerala and Meghalaya, are
providing reservations to Ex-Servicemen in
the State Government jobs. It has,
however, not been possible to have
statutory backing to the reservations being
provided to them, inter alia, due to the


overall ceiling of 50% imposed by the
Supreme Court and 49.5% reservation
already having been provided in the
Government jobs for SC/ST/OBC.
Therefore, the reservation being provided
to Ex-Servicemen is of horizontal nature,
which implies that Ex-Servicemen selected
against the vacancies reserved for them are
subsequently adjusted against the relevant
category i.e., SC, ST, OBC or General to
which they belong. There is also no carry
forward of unfilled reserved vacancies
under horizontal vacancies.

###### SECURITY AGENCIES

11.9 The Directorate General of Resettlement
(DGR) registers/sponsors Security
Agencies for providing Security Guards
to various Public Sector Undertakings
and industries in private sector. The
scheme offers self employment
opportunities to retired Defence Officers
and employment opportunity to exPBOR. The Department of Public
Enterprises (DPE) had issued
instructions to the PSUs to get security
personnel through DGR sponsored
Security Agencies. The scheme has
shown good results. All State
Governments have also been requested
to issue suitable instructions to all
concerned under their jurisdiction to
obtain security cover through DGR
empanelled agencies, thereby furthering
the cause of resettling Ex-Servicemen.

owing to exigencies of service and the
need to work in difficult geo-climatic
conditions, such as desert in the west,
glaciers in the north, rain forests in the east


-----

to the length of service rendered by the
individual and the Disability element is
paid in the form of compensation for the
disablement and depends on the degree of
disablement. The amount of service
element is equal to the normal retiring/
service pension. With effect from January
1, 1996 the service element subject to a
minimum of Rs.1275/- p.m. is also payable
when the length of service rendered is less
than the minimum pensionable service.
Personnel with 100% disability are also
paid a Constant Attendant Allowance at
the rate of Rs.600/- p.m. on the
recommendations of a Medical Board. In
all other cases, where the personnel are
invalided out of service with a disability,
neither attributable to nor aggravated by
the military service, invalid pension is
granted, if the service, actually rendered
is 10 years or more. If the service is less
than 10 years, such Service personnel are
paid Invalid gratuity depending upon the
length of service. Pursuant to the
implementation of the 5[th] Central Pay
Commission, relating to disability
pension/liberalised pension/war injury
pension etc. the rates of disability pension
have been revised with effect from January
1, 1996 as under:

**(a) On Invalidment**

Where an individual is invalided out of
service on account of causes attributable to
or aggravated by military service, he/she
is entitled to disability pension as under :
(i) **Service element - Equal to normal**
retiring/service pension for the length


the modified parity, in the case of past
pensioners, with effect from January 1,
1996, pension would not be less than 50%
of the minimum pay in the revised scale
of the pay introduced w.e.f. January 1,1996
for the rank, rank and group (in the case
of PBORs) held by the pensioner. While
in the case of commissioned officers of the
Army, Navy and Air Force, the minimum
period of qualifying service (without
weightage) required for earning retiring
pension is 20 years (15 years in the case of
late entrants), in the case of PBOR it is 15
years {20 years in the case of NonCombatants Enrolled (NCsE)}. However,
keeping in view their early retirement,
Armed Forces personnel are given the
benefit of weightage ranging from 9 years
for Captains and below to 3 years for
Generals. Personnel Below Officers Rank
are given the uniform benefit of 5 years.
For calculating gratuity, a uniform
weightage of 5 years service is given to
all ranks. Armed Forces Personnel are also
permitted higher commutation of their
pension at 43% for officers and 45% for
PBORs as compared to 40% for civilians.

11.25 Army Reservists, who did not opt for
grant of pension and have not availed the
benefits of Rehabilitation assistance
granted by the Government and are not
in receipt of any other pension, are
sanctioned an ex-gratia payment of Rs.
600/- p.m. plus dearness relief w.e.f
November, 1997, provided they had
rendered minimum qualifying service to
earn pension.


###### CATEGORISATION OF CASES FOR DETERMINING PENSIONARY BENEFITS

11.26 On the basis of recommendations of the
5 [th] Central Pay Commission, for
determining the pensionary benefits for
death or disability under different
circumstances due to attributable/
aggravated causes, the cases have been
broadly divided into 5 categories as
indicated below :
CATEGORY A : Death or disability due to
natural causes.

CATEGORY B : Death or disability due to causes
attributable or aggravated by
military services.

CATEGORY C : Death or disability due to
accidents while performing
duties.

CATEGORY D : Death or disability due to acts
of violence/attacks by
terrorists whether or not on
duty.

CATEGORY E : Death or disability due to war
or war-like situation.

###### DISABILITY PENSION

11.27 A person, who is released/retired from
service, on account of a disease/injury/
wound attributable to or aggravated by
military service (Categories B and C), is
entitled to disability pension provided
the disability assessed by the Medical
Board is 20% or more. Disability Pension
consists of Service element and Disability
element The Service element is related


-----

of service actually rendered plus
weightage as admissible. With effect
from January 1, 1996, the service
element subject to a minimum of
Rs.1275/- p.m. is admissible. There
is no condition of minimum qualifying
service for earning this element.

Officers (JCOs) &
equivalents

Other Ranks Rs.1550/- per month

(iii) Broad banding of disability- In case
of invalidment on or after January 1,
1996, the extent of disability or
functional incapacity is determined
as under for the purpose of
computing disability element :
Disability less than 50%    - 50%

Between 50 and 75%   - 75%

Between 76 and 100%   - 100%

Where permanent disability is not less than
60%, the disability pension(service element
plus disability element) is payable at not
less than 60% of the reckonable
emoluments last drawn by the individual.

(b) **In case of Retention of Personnel**
**Despite Disability**

Where an individual is retained in service


despite disability and retires/is discharged
on attaining the age of retirement or on
completion of tenure, w.e.f. January 1, 1996
he / she is entitled to disability element at
the following rates (for 100 % disability) :
**Commissioned Officers Rs.2600/- per month**

**JCOs & equivalents** Rs.1900/- per month

**Other Ranks** Rs.1550/- per month

l For disabilities less than 100% but not
less than 20%, the above rates are
proportionately reduced. No disability
element for less than 20% disability is
admissible.

l Retiring/service pension or retiring/
service gratuity as admissible is also
payable in addition to the disability
element from the date of retirement/
discharge.

On the basis of the recommendations of the
5[th] Central Pay Commission, the procedure
regarding acceptance of attributability
pertaining to disability and special family
pension and assessment of degree of
disability has undergone change. As per the
revised instructions the procedure of
periodical reviews by Re-Survey Medical
Board for re-assessment and continuance of
disability pension has also been dispensed
with. In injury cases, the percentage of
disability as recommended by Invaliding/
Release medical board and as approved by
the next higher medical authority is treated
as final unless the individual himself
requests for a review. Likewise in cases of
diseases of permanent nature, the


assessment of degree of disability as
recommended by Invaliding Medical Board
(IMB)/ Release Medical Board (RMB) and
as adjudicated by Medical Adviser
(Pensions) [MA(P)] in case of PBOR and
Service Headquarters in respect of Officers
is treated as final unless the individual
himself requests for a review. In case of
disabilities which are not of a permanent
nature, there will be only one review which
will be final and for life unless the individual
himself asks for a review.

**(c)** **Lumpsum compensation in lieu of**
**disability element :** If an individual is
found to have a disability which is assessed
at 20% or more for life but is retained in
service despite such disability, he/she is
paid a compensation in lump sum (in lieu
of disability element) equal to the
capitalised value of disability element on
the basis of disability actually assessed. In
cases of casualties occurring on or after
January 1, 1996 the rates for disability
element effective from January 1, 1996 are
applicable for calculating the capitalised
value. Once a compensation has been paid
in lieu of the disability element, there is no
further entitlement to the disability element
for the same disability.

individual, who sustains injury/disability in
war or war like operations(Category E) and

element will exceed last pay drawn.

recommendations of the 5[th] Central Pay
Commission relating to disability pension/
liberalised pension/war injury pension etc.
the rates of disability element in respect of
war injury are taken as double the amount
as mentioned above at para 11.27(a) (ii). The
extent of disability or functional incapacity
for the purpose of computing war injury
element in the cases of invalidment is
determined as in para 11.27(a) (iii).

###### MOUNTAINEERING INSTITUTES

14.12 The Ministry of Defence administers jointly
with the concerned State Governments
three Mountaineering Institutes namely
Himalayan Mountaineering Institute
(HMI), Darjeeling in West Bengal, Nehru
Institute of Mountaineering (NIM),
Uttarkashi in Uttranchal and Jawahar
Institute of Mountaineering & Winter
Sports (JIM), Aru with temporary HQ at
Batote in J&K. These Institutes are run as
private Registered Societies and have been
conferred the status of autonomous bodies.
Raksha Mantri is the President of these
Institutes. The Chief Minister of the
respective State is the Vice-President of the
Institute. These Institutes are governed by
separate Executive Councils consisting of


members elected by the General Bodies,
nominees from amongst donors and/or
persons who are likely to promote the cause
of the Institute and representatives of
Central and State Governments. A
representative each of the Ministry of
Defence and State Government acts as
Secretary of the Institute.

14.13 The HMI, Darjeeling was founded in
November 1954 by the then Prime Minister
Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru to commemorate
the historical ascent of Mount Everest by
Late Tenzing Norgay along with Sir
Edmund Hillary on May 29, 1953. With
the establishment of this Institute, an
impetus to mountaineering as a sport was
provided in India. To give further boost to
mountaineering and to inculcate the spirit
of adventure in youth, the NIM, Uttarkashi
was set up in October 1965 and the JIM at
Aru in J&K in October 1983. Due to
disturbances in the valley, students were
reluctant to come to Aru for training.
Accordingly, it was decided to shift the
Institute temporarily to Batote on the
Jammu side of Banihal in August 1990.
However, in view of certain adverse reports
regarding law & order, regular training
courses conducted by the Institute were
temporarily suspended from April 1996.
The Institute is now conducting some
courses on ad-hoc basis.

14.14 The broad objectives of the Mountaineering
Institutes are:
(a) to impart theoretical and practical
training in mountaineering and rock
climbing techniques;


(b) to awaken interest in and love for
mountains and exploration; and

(c) to encourage and provide training in
Winter Sports

14.15 The Institutes conduct Basic and Advance
Mountaineering Courses, Method of
Instruction Course (MOI), Search & Rescue
Course (S&R) and Adventure Courses. The
syllabi, duration, age limit of participants
and grading system for various types of
courses are almost uniform at all the
Institutes. During the lean period, the
Institutes detail their Instructors to conduct
rock-climbing courses at the request of
Mountaineering Clubs/Organisations
around the country. The Instructors also
join various expeditions.

14.16 Trainees for these courses come from all
parts of the country and include Army, Air
Force, Navy, ITBP and BSF Personnel, NCC
Cadets and private students. Foreigners are
also now permitted to join the courses. The
Institutes conducted the following courses
during the year upto December, 2002 :
**Institute Basic** **Advance Adventure** **MOI S&R**

HMI 05 02 08 01 
NIM 06 03 03 01 01

JIM 03 02 03 +10* 02 
- Short Adventure Courses

NIM also conducted a special course for
ONGC and a course for Liaison Officers for
IMF, New Delhi.

14.17 The number of students trained in these
courses are as under:
|Institute|Basic|Advance|Adventure|MOI|S&R|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|HMI|05|02|08|01|-|

###### OFFICIAL LANGUAGE DIVISION

14.31 Official Language Division of the Ministry
of Defence is the nodal Agency to
implement the Official Language Policy of
the Government in the Ministry, its
Subordinate Offices, Defence Undertakings
etc. Implementation of orders/ instructions
regarding use of Hindi in official work is
monitored by the Official Language
Division through various channels, such as
quarterly progress reports, annual
evaluation reports, quarterly meetings of
departmental Official Language
Implementation Committees, Hindi
Salahkar Samities and inspections of the
offices located all over the country. The
other main functions of this Division are :
(i) to translate the material received
from various offices, divisions and
sections of the Ministry;

(ii) to impart training to staff mainly in
Hindi, Hindi stenography and Hindi
typing through the Hindi Teaching
Scheme of the Ministry of Home
Affairs; and

(iii) to propagate and promote the use of
Hindi in official work by organizing
Hindi workshops, seminars,
sammelans etc and by encouraging


various incentive schemes introduced
in the Ministry.

14.32 Like previous years, Official Language
Division fixed certain targets for itself, such
as the organization of Hindi Workshop,
inspection of different sections of the
Ministry, nomination of 56 officials for
training in Hindi, Hindi Stenography and
Hindi Typing courses; organization of 4
meetings each of the two Official Language
Implementation Committees etc. All these
targets have been fully achieved. Work
relating to selection of best in-house
journals published by various defence
organizations during the year for awarding
cash prizes etc. is in progress.

14.33 The Official Language Division remained
engaged in translation work throughout the
year. The material received for such
translation included general orders,
notifications, resolutions, cabinet notes,
administrative and other reports,
parliament questions etc. Besides, material
relating to PAC matters, audit paras,
Consultative Committee meeting, Standing
Committee, Annual Report, papers to be
laid in the Parliament, VIP references,
Republic Day, Independence Day and the
investiture ceremony was also translated
into Hindi during the year.

14.34 In accordance with the targets fixed for
imparting training to the staff in Hindi,
Hindi Stenography and Hindi Typing,
efforts were made to nominate maximum
number of officials in these courses. During
the year, out of 41 officials nominated for
Hindi classes 19 were for Hindi (Prabodh


Praveen and Pragya), 12 for Hindi
stenography and 10 for Hindi Typing.

14.35 In order to encourage more and more staff
to work in Hindi, two Hindi workshops
were organized till November, 2002, in
which 33 officials participated. The purpose
of these workshops was to motivate the
officials to use Hindi in their official work.
For this, the participants were provided
practice exercises in the respective subjects
and were also apprised of the provisions
of the Official Language Act and Rules
made thereunder to facilitate them to work
in Hindi with more confidence. The
subordinate offices, Inter-Service
Organisations and Public Sector
Undertakings under the Ministry of
Defence were also advised to organize
such Hindi workshops in their respective
offices to encourage their staff to use Hindi
in their official work. Officers of Official
Language Division assisted them in
organizing Hindi workshops and provided
them necessary guidance in this regard.

14.36 Monitoring : The overall monitoring
regarding the progressive use of Hindi in
the Ministry of Defence Secretariat, the
three Services Headquarters, Inter-Service
Organisations and Defence Undertakings
is done by two separate Departmental
Official Language Implementation
Committees, which meet regularly after
every three months. These Committees
review progress made in the subordinate
offices for implementing the Official
Language Policy of the Union more
effectively. The Committee of Parliament
on Official Language visited various


-----

Defence Organisations located all over the
country including Delhi, Faridabad,
Coimbatore, Jodhpur, Hyderabad, Mumbai
etc. for conducting Official Language
inspections.

14.37 Hindi Pakhwara : A Hindi Pakhwara was
observed during September 1-14, 2002 in
the Ministry as well as in its subordinate
offices and Defence Undertakings. The
message issued on this occasion by the
Home Minister, Raksha Mantri and
Cabinet Secretary were circulated among
all officers and staff of the Ministry as also
among three Services Headquarters and
various Defence Organisations spread all
over the country. The officers and staff
were motivated to do their official work
in Hindi. To achieve this end, various
competitions were organized during the
fortnight in which 224 officials
participated and out of which, 107 officials
were selected for award of prizes
amounting to Rs. 43,700/-. The Pakhwara
was followed, in the later part of the year,
by Prize Distribution Function, Hindi
Workshops, Official Language Inspections,
Personal Contact Programmes, meetings
of Official Language Implementation
Committees etc.

14.38 Salahkar Samities : There are two Hindi
Salahkar Samities in the Ministry of
Defence – one for the Department of
Defence and Department of Defence
Research & Development and the other for
the Department of Defence Production &
Supplies. The meetings of these
Committees are organized from time to
time


###### DEFENCE COOPERATION WITH FOREIGN COUNTRIES

14.39 Strengthening of defence cooperation with
friendly countries is an important objective
and component of our overall foreign and
defence policies. The threat posed by global
and cross-border terrorism, and the
consequent changes that have taken place
in the international and regional political
and strategic environment, have brought
about a greater convergence of security
perceptions and prompted closer defencerelated contacts, exchanges and
cooperation with a widening group of
countries.

14.40 A snapshot view of India’s bilateral defence
relations as they evolved in 2002-03 is
indicated in the succeeding paragraphs.

14.41 Defence relations with India’s immediate
neighbours have already been covered in
the context of Chapter-I on ‘Security
Environment’. A brief synopsis of defence,
military and security-related exchanges
during the year is summarized below.

14.42 With China, attempts to improve the
bilateral relationship in the political,
economic and defence-related spheres
amongst others, continued. Defence
exchanges with China which had resumed
after the visit of former PM Rajiv Gandhi
in 1988, were suspended after India’s
nuclear tests in May, 1998. They resumed
thereafter with a visit by an Indian naval
ship to Shanghai in September 2000. In
2002, China and India exchanged two
military delegations each. Indian officers
also participated in the National Security


and Military Command Course at the
NDU, Beijing.

14.43 With regard to India’s eastern neighbours,
the Chief of Army Staff of India visited
Nepal in May 2002 and Bhutan in
September 2002. The Chief of Army Staff
of Nepal visited India in December 2002.
These visits affirmed the traditional bonds
of friendship and goodwill between India
and the two close neighbours and India’s
commitment to help Nepal in maintaining
its internal security. The Chief of Air Staff
of Bangladesh visited India in March 2003
to promote goodwill between the two
armed forces. A defence delegation from
India visited Myanmar in September 2002
to explore fresh areas of cooperation
between India and Myanmar.

14.44 The Chief of Air Staff of India visited Sri
Lanka in February 2003. The visit helped
both sides review mutual areas of concern
in the strategic and security environment
of both countries. Possible new initiatives
for defence cooperation were also
discussed.

14.45 The Minister of State for Defence and
National Security of Maldives visited India
in December 2002. India’s ongoing defence
cooperation with Maldives in matters
related to security and defence training, as
well as defence equipment was reviewed
formally. Potential areas for defence
cooperation such as hydrographic surveys
were also discussed.

14.46 The Central Asian Republics are important
nations in India’s extended strategic
neighbourhood. Developments in the


-----

region have a direct bearing on our security
interests. India shares deep-rooted
historical and cultural ties with these
societies and is engaged in an endeavour
to further develop them. India was
amongst the first to establish diplomatic
relations in all the Central Asian States.

14.47 Raksha Mantri visited Tajikistan in April
2002 during the course of which India and
Tajikistan signed a Defence Cooperation
Agreement. The Deputy Defence Minister
of Tajikistan visited India in December
2002. Ongoing defence cooperation
activities relating to training, defence
supplies and industry were reviewed and
advanced during the visit.

14.48 India and Uzbekistan share similar
security concerns and offer good
potential for defence cooperation. The
Indian Chief of Air Staff visited
Uzbekistan in September 2002. This was
followed up by a visit by Raksha Mantri
in February 2003, the first by an Indian
Defence Minister to Uzbekistan,
cementing an ongoing mutually
beneficial relationship and identifying
future areas of cooperation in the area of
security and defence for follow up.

14.49 In view of its advanced defence industry,
the prospects for cooperation with
Kazakhstan in the sphere of defence
industry and technology are also high. A
Defence Cooperation Agreement, signed
with Kazakhstan in June 2002 during the
Prime Minister’s visit to Kazakhstan, is
expected to give a fillip to such cooperation
between the two countries


14.50 The Persian Gulf and West Asian region
represent a vital part of India’s strategic
neighbourhood, especially in terms of
India’s energy security. The region also has
a large expatriate Indian population. India
has, therefore, a strong national interest in
peace and stability in this region.

14.51 India shares a historically unique
relationship with Oman that extends to a
desire on both sides for a deeper defence
relationship. In the past, some of Oman’s
need for medical personnel for the armed
forces were fulfilled by Indian armed forces
medical staff. Oman has also been inviting
Indian officers as observers at its joint
military exercises with other nations.
Raksha Mantri visited Oman in October,
2002 and held discussions on defence
cooperation issues and other matters of
mutual security interest.

14.52 The defence relationship between India and
Israel has been growing steadily. The first
meeting of the Joint India-Israel Working
Group on Defence Cooperation formed to
institutionalize such cooperation, was held
in Israel in September, 2002.

14.53 The President of Iran was the Chief Guest
at India’s Republic Day celebrations on 26[th]

January, 2003. The President’s delegation
to India included the Minister of Defence
of Iran. Possibilities of bilateral defence
cooperation were discussed during this
visit. The Indian Naval Chief also made a
goodwill visit to Iran in January, 2003.

14.54 As part of India’s ‘Look East’ foreign policy,
defence cooperation forms an important
component of our relations with countries


of South East Asia. Its strategic location,
and challenges posed by instability and
terrorism in the region, make it an area of
cooperative security interest for India.
India’s increasing engagement with the
ASEAN countries has also witnessed an
upsurge in cooperation in the defence
sector. Mutual complementarities are being
explored in such relations with many
countries of this region such as Singapore,
Laos, Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia,
Indonesia and Philippines.

14.55 Raksha Mantri participated in the Asian
Security Conference in June 2002 in
Singapore organized by International
Institute of Strategic Studies (UK), which
was also attended by the Defence Ministers
and senior defence officials of the US, UK,
Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore,
Indonesia, Malaysia and Philippines
amongst others. India and Singapore also
evinced strong mutual interest in raising
their level of defence cooperation. The 10[th]

India-Singapore joint naval exercise was
held in Kochi in March 2003. The Singapore
Navy Chief of Staff also visited India
during the occasion.

14.56 An Agreement on defence cooperation
between India and Laos was signed during
the visit of Prime Minister to Laos in
November 2002. The Agreement provides
the institutional framework for future
bilateral defence cooperation. The Lao
Minister of National Defence visited India
in January 2003 to enhance defence ties
between India and Laos primarily in the
area of military training for the Lao defence
services.


-----

14.57 India and Malaysia have a long-standing
mechanism to discuss and explore
possibilities for defence cooperation. The
4[th] meeting of Malaysia-India Defence
Committee was held in New Delhi from
September 12-13, 2002. The Committee
discussed possibilities of cooperation in
defence production and maintenance,
training and sharing of information on
common defence equipment amongst
other things.

14.58 During the visit of the Secretary for
National Defence of Philippines to India
at the Defence Expo last February, both
countries affirmed their desire to increase
defence cooperation setting the momentum
for further exchanges. The Philippines
Chief of Army visited India in August 2002.
Defence-related contacts with the countries
of the ASEAN continued including a
hydrographic survey with in Indonesian
waters, goodwill visits by Indian naval
ships at Indonesian, Philippines and Thai
ports.

14.59 The East Asia/Pacific region has not
featured very prominently in the bilateral
defence cooperation matrix of India.
However, the year 2002-03 witnessed
increased contact with countries in this
region such as Japan, Republic of Korea,
Australia and New Zealand.

14.60 A common interest of India and Japan in
ensuring the safety and security of sealanes in the Indian Ocean especially in
relation to piracy and transnational crimes
has led to greater interaction between their
respective Navies and Coast Guard
organizations Raksha Mantri visited Japan


in July 2002 and held wide-ranging
discussions in areas of mutual strategic
interest with the Defence Minister of Japan.
The Chief of Air Force of Japan visited India
in December, 2002. The two have also been
interacting closely in the context of the ARF.
These and other contacts have raised the
level of familiarity with, and goodwill for,
each other in the security and defence
spheres.

14.61 India and Australia resumed their
defence and security-related dialogue
and contacts in 2001. Raksha Mantri met
the Australian Defence Minister during
the Asia Security Conference at
Singapore in June 2002. The Defence
Secretary of Australia visited India in
August 2002. The Indian Chief of Naval
Staff visited Australia in November 2002.
Defence representatives participated in
the Second Session of the India-Australia
Strategic Dialogue held in Canberra,
March 2003. These exchanges help to
provide a better appreciation of each
other’s security concerns and identify
possible areas of cooperation.

14.62 Russia has a historically close defence
relationship with India. Both at the political
and defence level, India’s relationship with
Russia is characterized by continuity, trust
and mutual understanding. A significantly
large proportion of Army, Navy and Air
Force platforms are of Soviet/Russian
origin. Many new acquisitions are being
planned from Russia.

14.63 Raksha Mantri visited Russia in April 2002.
During the visit, wide-ranging discussions
were held with the Russian leadership


regarding ongoing defence cooperation
issues. The Chief of Naval Staff also visited
Russia in August 2002, to discuss and
progress navy-related issues.

14.64 The Third Meeting of the Indo-Russian
Inter-Governmental Commission on
Military-Technical Cooperation led by
Raksha Mantri, was held in Moscow from
January 15-17, 2003 in which ongoing and
future defence cooperation activities were
reviewed and discussed. Protocols were
also signed at various levels between the
Indian and the Russian side covering these
issues.

14.65 The close military ties of some of the
countries in Central and East Europe with
the erstwhile Soviet Union, and their new
partnerships, offer significant opportunities
for defence cooperation. India has been
actively engaged on defence matters in this
region with Ukraine, Belarus, Poland,
Bulgaria and the Czech Republic, amongst
others.

14.66 Ukraine has a sizable defence industry
establishment with many areas of interest
to the Indian Armed Forces. The Chief of
Air Force visited Ukraine in September
2002. The Ukraine President, along with the
Ukraine Defence Minister, visited India in
October 2002. Raksha Mantri held
discussions with the Ukraine Defence
Minister on enhancing ties between the two
defence establishments.

14.67 A defence delegation from Belarus
accompanied the Belarus Prime Minister
during his official visit to India in
September 2002 and held discussions with


-----

14.73 United States-India defence ties have been
warming up over the last few years after a
hiatus in mid-1998. Such cooperation
received a significant boost in 2002-03
manifested in the large number of high
level visits that took place on both sides.
The US Chairman, Joint Chief of Staff
visited India in February, 2002. The Indian
Chief of Army Staff visited the US in April,
2002, the Chief of Air Staff in June, 2002
and the Chief of Naval Staff in September,
2002. The US Army Chief visited India in
February, 2003.

14.74 The 4[th] Indo-US Defence Policy Group
meeting was held in May, 2002. Many
significant initiatives were taken during
this meeting. These included plans for joint
military exercises including joint patrolling
of high density sea lanes, combating
terrorism, weapons and equipment
supplies from the US, environmental
security, defence technology cooperation,
humanitarian relief and disaster response,
search and rescue activities, cyber- security,
etc. Joint air exercises with the US were
conducted at Agra in May and October,
2002. Airborne exercises consisting of
Indian Army and Air Force units and US
ARPAC units were held in Alaska in
October, 2002. The 4[th] Indo-US bilateral
naval exercises conducted off Kochi in
September-October 2002. As a follow up to
the May 2002 DPG meeting, the Executive
Steering Groups of the Air Force, Army and
Navy of both countries met in November
2002, December 2002, and January 2003
respectively and chalked out a large
number of mutual action plans that were
ratified at the February 2003 meeting of the


Raksha Mantri on prospective areas of
bilateral defence cooperation.

14.68 Similarly, there is a good scope for defence
cooperation between India and Poland. A
defence delegation led by the Minister of
State for National Defence accompanied the
Prime Minister of Poland who visited India
in February 2003. An agreement on
cooperation in the field of defence was signed
between India and Poland during the visit.

14.69 India has an active strategic dialogue with
its principal interlocutors in Western
Europe and also a mutually beneficial
defence relationship covering a widening
range of activities including training
exchanges, joint exercises and defence
procurement, production and R&D. The
Ninth Round of the Indo-French Strategic
Dialogue held on January 6, 2003 in New
Delhi discussed issues of mutual concern
including defence cooperation. The Fifth
Round of the Indo-French High Committee
on Defence held in Paris in November 2002
focused on an in-depth review of bilateral
cooperation and steps to further deepen and
diversify cooperation in the defence area.
The visit of the French Prime Minister Mr.
Jean Pierre Raffarin to India on February 67, 2003 and his presence at the ‘Aero India
2003’ is indicative of the value attached by
both countries to cooperation in the field of
defence. Four joint collaboration agreements
between French and Indian defence
industries were signed during the occasion.
A joint naval exercise, ‘Varuna’ was
conducted off Goa in May 2002 witnessed
by the French Navy Chief and a major joint
air exercise ‘Garuda’ was conducted at


Gwalior in February 2003 at which the
French Chief of Air Staff was also present.

14.70 The year saw a continued intensification of
defence cooperation with the United
Kingdom. UK Defence Secretary Mr. Geoff
Hoon, visited India in July 2002 and held
wide-ranging discussions with Raksha
Mantri, External Affairs Minister and
National Security Advisor. At the official
level, interaction has centered around the
bilateral Defence Consultative Group
(DCG), which meets annually. The DCG
identified several areas for joint initiatives.
Other exchanges during the year include
the visit of the Joint Chief of Integrated
Defence Staff to UK in April, 2002, and the
visit of the UK Minister for Defence
Procurement in February 2003 to attend the
Aero India, 2003.

14.71 Raksha Mantri visited Italy from
September 18-22, 2002. The Italian Defence
Minister Mr. Antonio Martino paid a return
visit to India from February 2-5, 2003. A
Defence Cooperation Agreement intended
to step up defence cooperation was signed.
Institutional contacts with Italy at the
service level through the Joint Defence
Committee, last held in June 2002, have
been regular. Chief of Army Staff General
S. Padmanabhan visited Italy and France
in October-November 2002.

14.72 The year also witnessed an impetus to
defence contacts with Germany. The
German Air Force Chief, Gerhard Back,
visited India in October 2002, the first by a
German Service Chief since 1992. The
second round of bilateral military staff talks
was held in Berlin in August 2002.


-----

Military Cooperation Group of both
countries.

14.75 The continent of Africa has many
countries with which India has had deep
historical and political bonds, including
those linked to India’s stance against
colonialism and apartheid and India’s
role in the Non-Aligned Movement.
Many of these countries in this region
have had close defence training
interaction with Indian military training


establishments. There are also
opportunities for sourcing defence
equipment from some countries and
supplying equipment to others.

14.76 Among the African nations, South Africa
is a country with which India has
significant defence ties. This country has
emerged as an important supplier of
defence equipment. Defence cooperation
between the two countries has been
substantial and continues to grow steadily.


The third India-South Africa Defence
Committee meeting was held in South
Africa in November, 2002. Security
perceptions were exchanged and
opportunities for sourcing equipment, coproduction, training etc. advanced. The
Chief of Naval Staff visited South Africa
in February 2003, followed by the visit of
the Chief of the South African Army to
India strengthening the bonds of defence
cooperation between Indian and South
African armed forces.

14.77 The Republic of Mauritius is strategically
located in the Indian Ocean. India and
Mauritius have been cooperating in
defence-related activities, such as supply
of defence equipment by India, technical
support for Mauritius naval vessels, Coast
Guard related cooperation, training
activities, etc. The Mauritius Prime
Minister’s visit to India in January 2003
included a specific visit to the Western
Naval Command. The Indian Chief of
Naval Staff visited Mauritius in February
2003. A number of on-going defence
cooperation issues were reviewed during
the visit.

14.78 As would be evident from the above, during
the year 2002-03 the India’s defence
cooperation engagement with the countries
of the world increased very significantly. The
growth of defence cooperation with partners
was driven by strategic, security, political and
commercial considerations. They are also
reflective of a perception by many nations of
India as a force for peace, moderation and
stability in the region and beyond.

### EMPOWERMENT & WELFARE OF WOMEN

_Lady Cadets Passing Out from Officers Training Academy, Chennai_


-----

16.1 The role of women in Defence has been
increasing steadily. Already there was
presence of women in Defence Production
Units, Defence Research & Development
Laboratories and also as Doctors & Nursing
Officers in Armed Forces. With induction
of women in various non-combatant arms
of Armed Forces like logistics, judicial etc.,
a larger role is envisaged for women in
Defence.

16.2 Women Special Entry Scheme(WSES) has
been introduced for women to join as
officers in non-combatant arms of the
Armed Forces. WSES has also been
extended to widows of Service officers
killed in action. Eligible women are
recruited as officers on Short Service
Commission basis in various branches of
Army, Navy and Air Force.

16.3 Women are playing important role in
Defence Research & Development.
Qualified women scientists and technical
officers and staff are actively involved in
various research projects. A number of
senior women scientists are heading


important research Divisions in the various
Defence Laboratories/Establishments.

16.4 A separate forum of Women in Public
Sector (WIPS) has been established in
Defence Public Sector Undetakings under
the ageis of Standing Conference of Public
Enterprises (SCOPE) to assist the DPSUs
in harnessing the full potential of women
employees, to play a catalytic role in
improving the status of women in and
around DPSUs. DPSUs have provided
certain facilities to working women, such
as crèches for the children of working
women, lunch and rest rooms for them and
grievances cells for the welfare of working
women. Besides this, mechanism has been
set up to check sexual harassment of
working women in production units.

16.5 Creation of opportunities for women is not
enough for their optimal participation in
Defence. It is also important that conducive
work environment and appropriate
working conditions are provided to them.
Though the service conditions of the
Armed Forces are different, Ministry of
Defence has taken several steps in this
regard. The manpower/ human resource
development policies followed in the
Ministry of Defence make no distinction/
discrimination on the grounds of sex.


16.7 In pursuance of these directions,
‘Complaints Committees’ have been
constituted at the Headquarters as well as
at Units levels for redressal of complaints
received from women employees and to
review matters relating to safeguard of
women. The provisions of various rules
and regulations have been amended on the
lines of the guidelines laid down by the
Supreme Court.

16.8 The guidelines of National Commission for
Women (NCW) are also being implemented
and the Women Cell of Ministry of Defence,
with assistance of 23 Nodal Women Cells
spread all over the country, is functioning
effectively. The Women Cells look into
specific grievances of women employees.

16.9 Every effort is made to ensure that
appropriate working conditions are
provided for women. Major DPSUs/
Laboratories have provision for crèches and
restrooms for the women employees. In the
DPSUs transport facility is also available
to women employees residing within five
kms of their work place.


16.6 The guidelines of Hon’ble Supreme Court
to prevent sexual harassment at workplace
for working women to perform their duties
honourably and without fear, are being
implemented in the Armed Forces, Inter
Service Organisations, Defence Public
Sector Undertakings and Defence

rights, psychology of working women,
family counseling, art of living and stress
management are arranged through the
forum of Women In Public Sector (WIPS).
Representation of women in various
forums like Trade Unions, Consumer Cooperative Societies, House Building
Societies, Committees of Sports, Canteen
etc. has also increased considerably to take
up matters pertaining to development of
the women employees and associated
activities.

16.11 Ministry of Defence has some special
pension schemes for the widows of Service
personnel through which the widows of the
Armed Forces personnel died in war/ war
like operations/ counter insurgency
operations/ in incidents involving armed
hostilities or on account of causes
