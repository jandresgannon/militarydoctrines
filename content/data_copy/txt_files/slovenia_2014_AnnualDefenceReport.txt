## MILITARY DEFENCE

### 1 SCOPE AND STRUCTURE OF THE SAF

On the basis of medium-term planning documents, the scope of the Slovenian Armed Forces
(SAF) was set at 7600 members of the active component and 1500 members of the contract
reserve component. The government measure aimed at reducing the number of employees in
the state administration was also reflected in the SAF, since the number of its members
reduced based on the government personnel plan. The continuation of the reduction trend will
have a negative impact on the functioning of the SAF at home, as well as on its ability to meet
the obligations of Slovenia towards the Alliance.

### 2 SAF MILITARY TRAINING AND EXERCISES

**2.1 Overview of Important Training Courses of SAF Members and Units**

The SAF commands and units were trained in performing the tasks arising from the SAF
mission. The main focus was on the training of SAF members for the provision of national
defence tasks, participation in international operations and missions (IOM), operation in the
system of protection against natural and other disasters, task-based training of units for their
operation within the Alliance, and the achievement of planned operational capabilities.

The SAF units and commands participated in 25 international exercises and collective training
courses abroad (in Italy, Germany, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Czech Republic, Hungary,
Slovakia, Romania, Montenegro, France, Turkey and Greece).

In Slovenia, 16 major exercises and collective training courses for maintaining readiness and
building capabilities were carried out, attended also by members of other armed forces of the
Alliance. In total, more than 2,000 SAF members participated in exercises in Slovenia and
abroad.

Budget cuts had an impact on the implementation of already planned exercises. Only 70
percent of planned exercises were carried out.

As can be seen from the table below, there has been a significant decrease in financial
resources allocated to the military training and exercises since 2009. In nominal terms, they
decreased from EUR 3.4 million in 2009 to EUR 1.66 million in 2014, representing a 51 percent
reduction.

Despite the reduction in funding, the SAF participated in or organized several major exercises
and collective training events, namely:

  - International military exercise and at the same time the central tactical exercise of the
SAF commands and units Immediate Response 14.

  - International military exercise Adriatic Strike, in which the SAF, in cooperation with the
allied countries, trained forward air controllers/joint terminal attack controllers.

  - International exercise of the Multinational Land Force (MLF) Clever Ferret 14.

  - International military exercise Saber Junction 15 and exercise for the examination of
the training level of the military police company, allocated to the NATO Response Force
in the multinational joint training centre in Hohenfels.

  - Exercise for the examination of the training level of the motorized battalion battle group
according to NATO methodology Combat Readiness Evaluation (CREVAL).

  - Joint training events with the US Army 173[rd] Airborne Brigade.

  - International military exercise for enhancing the interoperability of the communication
and information systems Combined Endeavour 2014.

_»The Wounded« at the Exercise Immediate Response 14_

In 2014, 640 SAF members were referred to 60 different military occupational specialty (MOS)
training courses. 443 members successfully completed the training, and 90 members will
complete it in 2015.

**2.2 Training of Aviation Units**

Aviation units trained in the provision of air support to the SAF commands and units. They
trained in close air support, airspace interception and the provision of air and medical transport.

Pilots received training in the prescribed programmes for each individual type of aircraft to
maintain the level of training and renew the licences for pilots and instructors. 12 pilots
successfully completed the Aerobatics training programme. The training of pilots for certification
on the PC-9M airplane continued. Two new instructors were trained on the helicopter B-206. 53
participants successfully completed parachute training at the first and the second level.

In the area of individual training, members of the 15th Wing units were actively involved in
providing support to additional functional training courses, for example JTACs/FACs, parachute
and other functional training courses.

Aviation units participated in important exercises and SAF collective training events in Slovenia
and abroad. These include the exercises Adriatic Strike 2014, Tango Scramble, Skunk,
Ramstein Guard, Jawtex, Clever Ferret and Immediate Response, joint training courses with the
US Army 173[rd] Airborne Brigade, and training courses with the US Armed Forces school for
JTACs/FACs.

**2.3 Import ant Training Courses of the Naval Unit**

The training of naval units was focused on achieving operational readiness of the multi-purpose
boat Triglav 11, which ended in June with the examination of the training level. Additionally, the
unit received training for the provision of capabilities of a team of mine divers, which was
successfully completed in November.

In the area of individual training, courses were carried out for the training of two members for
the military occupational specialty diver. In addition, members of the 430th Naval Division also
participated in the training for mine clearance divers, training of the SAF ship crews for
operations in ports, training for the performance of the first stage of maintenance of the AK 306
weapons system, drill for the inspection of the seabed with a towed array sonar, and the training
of ship crews in CBRN defence.

Naval units participated in several important exercises and collective training events in Slovenia
and abroad: exercises Niriis 2014, Adrian Pool 2014, Immediate Response 2014, Turtle 2014,
Gulf 2014, Dolphin 2014, Adrion Livex 2014 and Combined Endeavor 2014, tactical training
Wild Boar, computer-assisted exercise Adrion Cax and the training and exercise Ship's Figting
Resistance.

**2.4 Training of the Contract Reserve Component**

In 2014, 68 call-ups for the members of the contract reserve component were planned, whereas
64 call-ups were actually carried out. Of the planned 153 call-up days, 97 call-up days were
actually realised, which represents a 63% realisation of the plan.

The training of the contact reserve component members was conducted in the Military Medical
Unit. Due to the lack of funding, the training was not conducted in other SAF units.

**2.5 Practice and Military Camps**

Professional practice or compulsory training in the SAF was successfully completed by 8 MoD
scholarship holders, in accordance with the scholarship contract.

The military camp was attended by 102 university and secondary school students at the age of
maturity. Professional practice at the camp was successfully completed by 42 students of the
Faculty of Criminal Justice and Security and 3 students of the Faculty of Social Sciences. The
MoD and Youth camp was attended by 47 secondary school students. In the framework of the
study programme, military practice was attended by 8 students of the Faculty of Social
Sciences.

### 3 DEVELOPMENT AND BUILDING OF SAF CAPABILITIES

In accordance with the Resolution on General Long-Term Development and Equipping
Programme of the Slovenian Armed Forces up to 2025 (ReGLTDEP 2025) from 2010, the
Medium-Term Defence Programme of the RS for the period 2013–2018 (MTDP 2013–2018)
was prepared as well as endorsed by the Government. Medium-Term Defence Programme is a
planning document defining objectives and key guidelines for the development and operation of
the defence system of the Republic of Slovenia in the medium-term period 2013–2018.

The applicable Medium-Term Defence Programme for the period 2013–2018 defines the target
SAF organisational structure in 2018, as well as the development of priority capabilities and
their equipping with new weapons and military equipment. The projected defence spending was
prepared, including the planned reduction in the expenditure on staff and gradual increase of
the proportion of operational (operational functioning and maintenance) and investment costs
(acquisition and construction), which are starting to increase significantly and progressively in
2015. The basic objective in the area of human resources is to maintain the SAF strength within
the limits of 7600 members of the active component and 1500 members of the contract reserve
component.

The Medium-Term Defence Programme is in line with the Resolution on General Long-Term
Development and Equipping Programme of the Slovenian Armed Forces up to 2025, as well as
with the agreed NATO capability targets for Slovenia. With these goals, Slovenia assumed, on
the basis of the principle of just burden-sharing based on the NATO Strategic Concept and
NATO Political Guidelines, obligations in the development of certain capabilities and in the
contribution of Slovenia to collective security.

Slovenia aims at maintaining the achieved level and eliminating shortcomings in the quality of
already developed capabilities (Light Battalion Battle Group, CBRN Defence Battalion) and
forming a Medium Battalion Battle Group, which will, in the next medium-term planning period,
through the purchase of additional equipment, develop into a Mechanized Battalion Battle
Group, capable of operating in all potential Alliance operations. The trend of several years of
cuts in the defence budget and thus the funds for the operation and development of the SAF
already has a significant impact on the SAF capabilities. With the gradual reduction of the SAF
financial resources from 2010 to 2014 and continuing of this trend in 2015, it is clear that it will
be hard for Slovenia to achieve the development of SAF capabilities planned in the MediumTerm Defence Programme of the RS for the Period 2013–2018 and its commitments towards
the Alliance, as well as the level of ambition referred to in the Resolution on General Long-Term
Development and Equipping Programme of the SAF up to 2025.

The reduction of the SAF resources brings about the increase of risk in the provision of the
planned defence system capabilities and hinders interoperability due to technological lag and
aging, which decreases the ability of operation of the RS in Slovenia and within the Alliance.
Under the given circumstances, such risks cannot be completely avoided. The SAF successfully
limited the perceived risks and negative impacts of the several years of reduction of resources.
Nevertheless, the negative consequences of this reduction are becoming more and more visible
and are beyond our influence.

### 4 MAINTAINING THE LEVEL OF READINESS

Economy measures, which were implemented primarily in the areas of modernization,
maintenance of infrastructure and vehicle fleet, and provision of working conditions,
accommodation and personal equipment of the SAF members, had an important negative
impact on ensuring the required level of readiness.

The SAF could no longer mitigate the effects of further reductions in funding without detriment
to its readiness. In the long term, the reductions in funding jeopardize the provision of the
required and necessary readiness of the SAF for carrying out its statutory tasks and fulfilling the
adopted international commitments of Slovenia.

The SAF provided a part of the necessary capabilities for its operation in the framework of the
Alliance and maintained its contribution in IOM and in reaction forces in accordance with its
commitments.

It supported the system of protection against natural and other disasters and was willing to
provide assistance to other state bodies and organisations in ensuring the safety and welfare of
the citizens of Slovenia.

### 5 KEY PROJECTS OF THE SAF MODERNISATION

The equipping of the SAF was conducted in accordance with the equipping plans and the
allocated financial resources. The following items were purchased: 1050 sets of protective
tactical vests with matching bags, 2554 combat helmets, items of the new battle dress uniform,
medical equipment, two fire rescue vehicles for the Cerklje ob Krki Airfield, engineering and
logistics machinery and a trailer for the transport of heavy armoured technology. Ammunition,
explosives and practice ordnance for training and preservation of stocks were also purchased.
The upgrade of the third helicopter was carried out.

In the framework of the US military assistance programmes, spare parts for 4x4 HMMWV light
wheeled armoured vehicles were supplied, as well as helicopter crew helmets, a military GPS
receiver, binocular night vision goggles and additional equipment for manual radio stations.

The SAF began to introduce into operational use the newly constructed buildings, the
associated equipment and two fire rescue vehicles at the Cerklje ob Krki Airfield, indoor pistol
shooting range in Kranj, semitrailers for the transport of heavy armoured technology and an
engineering excavator.

The revitalisation of the Cerklje ob Krki military airfield was also carried out as planned.

On the multi-purpose boat Triglav 11, the SAF continued the process of replacement of
communication systems. A new naval satellite terminal was installed, providing secure voice
and data communication between the boat and Slovenia, regardless of the location where the
task is performed.

Due to the significant reduction in funding in recent years, military communication and
information systems could not be modernised.

### 6 SAF OPERATION IN SUPPORT OF THE SYSTEM OF PROTECTION AGAINST NATURAL AND OTHER DISASTERS

The SAF actively supported the operation of the system of protection against natural and other
disasters and participated in it with its capabilities, with an emphasis on the helicopter rescue,
response to natural disasters (sleet and floods), and the setting up of launch bridges. The SAF
employs capabilities (units) depending on the level of readiness and the scope of disasters, and
provides the available forces upon the request of the Civil Protection Commander. Intervention
forces, which are properly trained and in constant readiness for operation in Slovenia, were
available for immediate assistance. In 2014, in accordance with the decision of the Slovenian
Government, the SAF also assisted in the mitigation of consequences of natural disasters
abroad.

**6.1 Helicopter Rescue and Assistance**

In the military part of the Jože Pučnik Ljubljana Airport, a SAF helicopter is in a 15-minute
standby each day during the day for mountain rescue. In addition to the rescue in mountains
and hard to access areas, the duty crew also performs emergency helicopter transports in the
framework of helicopter emergency medical assistance. The table below shows detailed
information about the helicopter rescue and assistance.

which 88 were mountain rescue operations, 76 were operations for the provision of emergency
medical helicopter assistance, and 25 were operations in response to natural disasters (sleet
and floods) and operations for the rescue of people and property after floods in Bosnia and
Herzegovina and Serbia. The crew transported 176 injured or sick persons, 370 emergency
responders and 35 tons of equipment, which totalled in 270 flying hours.

**6.2 Forms of Assistance and Operation of the SAF in the System of Protection against**
**Natural and Other Disasters**

On a number of occasions, the SAF participated in the mitigation of consequences of natural
disasters, mostly in Slovenia, but also abroad. It assisted in the protection, rescue and relief
during sleet, floods, in the setting up of launch bridges, the organisation and transport of
humanitarian assistance abroad, and in the mitigation of consequences of floods in Serbia and
Bosnia and Herzegovina.

The participation of the SAF was most intense in the first half of February 2014 during the
mitigation of consequences of sleet that hit certain areas of Slovenia. The SAF cleaned the
terrain and watercourse beds, transported and provided care for people in areas where the
access was significantly more difficult or where it was risky to access with civilian vehicles.

-----

Furthermore, they worked together with fire-fighters and employees of the Elektro Slovenia
company and forestry companies in the rehabilitation of the electricity grid and cleaning of road
communications; they provided helicopter transport for the supply of broadcast transmitters and
repeaters and provided transport of poles for power lines; they provided mobile laundries and
field toilets and performed other physical labour. In two weeks, 6175 SAF members were
engaged and 47,869 working hours were performed.

In the four floods that hit Slovenia in 2014, 1,944 members were engaged, and more than 2,000
of them were on standby. SAF members were mainly involved in flood prevention; they built
anti-flooding embankments; they transported people and provided care for them; they set up
mobile laundries and field toilets; they provided transport in flood-prone areas; they record the
consequences of floods with aircraft; they disinfected, common areas and together with other
actors provided other physical labour.

The SAF also set up six launch bridges in various parts of Slovenia.

At the end of May and beginning of June 2014, in accordance with the decision of the Slovenian
Government, the SAF took part in rescue and assistance operations abroad (Bosnia and
Herzegovina and Serbia) organizing and carrying out the transport of humanitarian aid and
helicopter emergency response operations in flooded areas. Six convoys for the transport of
humanitarian and other assistance to the affected areas were organised, with 110 vehicles
transporting 705 tons of cargo. A SAF company with 120 members, who participated in the
EUFOR joint military exercise in Bosnia and Herzegovina during the operations for the
mitigation of flood consequences, were actively involved in those operations in June. Company
members removed debris, disinfected public areas and facilities (nurseries, primary and
secondary schools, health centres, municipalities) and analysed water and soil.

The SAF set out to upgrade the SAF protection, rescue and relief capabilities in order to operate
more effectively within the system of protection against natural and other disasters.

### 7 SAF CONTRIBUTION TO INTERNATIONAL PEACE, SECURITY AND STABILITY 

Slovenia continued its participation in international operations and missions (IOM), taking into
account the fundamental national interests, available resources and capabilities, adopted
international commitments and partly unpredictable dynamics of the IOM. The SAF activities in
IOM were conducted on the basis of decisions of the Slovenian Government, MoD guidelines,
and plans for the SAF operations abroad. In terms of the participation of Slovenia in IOM, the
priority area of operations remains the Western Balkans (KFOR, EUFOR Althea, NATO
integration and counselling structures), and participation in the international security and
stabilization efforts in Afghanistan (ISAF), Middle East (UNIFIL, UNTSO) and North Africa
(EUTM Mali). When planning the participation of the SAF forces in IOM and preparing and
deploying the SAF contingents to IOM, great emphasis remains on lessons learned, which
contributed to the preparation and operation of the Slovenian contingents in IOM.

Average Annual Scope of Participation


**7.1 NATO Operations**

_KFOR (Kosovo)_

In accordance with the fundamental strategic interests of the Republic of Slovenia pertaining to
areas such as foreign affairs, security and others, the majority of the SAF members participating
in IOM performed their duties in the Western Balkans. There, the emphasis was laid on the
operation of the Allied KFOR Forces in Kosovo, in which an average of 308 SAF members and
four civilian functional experts took part. Under the KFOR mandate, Slovenian members'
activities were aimed at maintaining a secure and stable environment and freedom of
movement, protecting KFOR facilities and facilities of special importance, reconnaissance and
monitoring the security and general conditions in the area of operations, providing helicopter
transport, rapid response forces and tactical reserve, and performing staff duties. Members of
the Slovenian contingent also provided support to the development of Kosovo security forces
and the Ministry for the Kosovo Security Forces. The contingent operated mostly in the area of
central Kosovo, whereas a part of operational activities of the SAF units were also carried out in
the North of the country. At the international level, the MoD continuously defended Slovenia's
position that it is necessary to prudently and gradually address the issue of the further reduction
of the scope and changes in the posture of the KFOR forces, taking into account the security
situation on the ground and all the other relevant factors and conditions.

_ISAF (Afghanistan)_

In accordance with its international commitments and the principle of Allied solidarity, Slovenia
participated in international efforts to ensure security, stability and development of Afghanistan.
The posture and development of ISAF operation reflected the fact that at the end of 2014, its
mandate is coming to an end and that the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) took over
the responsibility for providing security throughout the Afghan territory, with the support of ISAF
until the end of 2014. ISAF underwent transformation and switched from operational to advisory
tasks. Accordingly, the SAF continued with the training of ANSF and adequately adjusted the
tasks and scope of the Slovenian contingent to the dynamics of the operation. At the beginning
of the year, the Slovenian contingent had 34 members (including one civilian functional expert
at the command in Kabul). A part of the contingent worked together with the Italians in the
engineering Military Advisory Team (MAT) in the Regional Command West (RC-W) in Herat,
whereas the members of the SAF Special Forces provided counselling to the ANSF Special
Forces in the Regional Command East (RC-E). A small number of the SAF members also
worked in command elements in RC-W in Herat and in the ISAF commands in Kabul. Taking
into account the Allied plans and the dynamics and process of conclusion of the ISAF mandate,
the Slovenian contingent deployed in the operation gradually reduced.

16/102


-----

After May 2014, when the major part of the Slovenian contingent completed the tasks of
counselling and training the ANSF in the west and east of Afghanistan, Slovenia maintained its
presence in Afghanistan with four SAF members performing staff duties in the ISAF commands
in Kabul and Herat. In the final rotation, from July to December 2014, Slovenia maintained two
staff duties in the Regional Command West in Herat, which simultaneously worked on for the
effective preparation and implementation of transition or participation of Slovenia in the new
NATO advisory mission Resolute Support in Afghanistan. The SAF successfully completed
logistics activities associated with the movement of equipment from Afghanistan to Slovenia.

The government adopted the decision to end the participation of Slovenia in the ISAF operation
at the end of 2014 and to participate in the new mission Resolute Support in Afghanistan as
from 1 January 2015 with the maximum of ten Slovenian members. Based on the strategic
guidelines, the SAF successfully conducted the preparations and deployment of the first
contingent members to the new mission at the end of 2014. In accordance with the Strategy of
Operation of the RS in Afghanistan, the Cooperation Strategy of the RS in IOM and the current
Alliance's planning dynamics for the setting up of a new mission in Afghanistan after 2014, interministerial coordination at various levels on possible forms of full participation of Slovenia at the
new mission took place in 2014. Concurrently, transparent information communication,
consultation and exchange of views were carried out with the RS National Assembly.

_NATO Response Force (NRF)_

Participation of the SAF in the NRF in the next five years is defined in the resolution adopted by
the Slovenian Government in May 2013. On this basis, the MoD or the SAF plans to participate,
in the framework of NRF, with those units in the future which contribute the highest added value
in the process of the SAF transformation, and in those »niche« areas that are of greatest
importance for the preparedness and further development of the SAF. In addition, the SAF
monitors and participates in the implementation of the Readiness Action Plan (RAP), adopted at
the NATO Wales Summit in September 2014. In 2014, Slovenia participated in immediate
readiness forces (IRF/NRF) with five members in the NATO Special Operations Headquarters
(NSHQ) and with its military police company in the RFP/NRF. Slovenia also deployed one SAF
officer to the NATO Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE).

_NATO's Peacetime Operation Air Policing in the Slovenian Airspace_

In 2014, the amended bilateral agreement between the governments of Slovenia and Hungary
on military cooperation in the fields of aviation and air defence from 1996, which enables the
inclusion of Hungary (besides Italy) in the above-mentioned NATO operation, was signed and
ratified. In addition to long-range radars for air policing, Slovenia also contributes two
helicopters for search and rescue (S&R).

_NATO HQ in Sarajevo and NATO Liaison Offices in Belgrade and Skopje_

The presence of six SAF members was maintained in the NATO HQ in Sarajevo and in the
NATO liaison offices in Belgrade and Skopje. Those six members were involved in performing
the tasks that are important in terms of carrying out defence and military reforms and
partnership programmes in host countries, and in terms of their progress towards Euro-Atlantic
structures.

**7.2 UN Operations and Missions**

_UNIFIL, UNTSO (Middle East)_

Middle East is one of the priority areas of cooperation of Slovenia in IOM. Therefore, the MoD
endeavoured to maintain an appropriate level of contribution of the SAF to the UN UNIFIL (14
members) and UNTSO (4 or 3 members) missions, which support the maintenance of peace in
the region. Due to the deterioration of security situation in the Golan Heights in Syria, the
resolution of the Slovenian Government on the geographical restrictions for the operation of the
SAF members in the UNTSO mission, which was adopted in June 2013, is still in place.

**7.3 EU Operations**

_EUTM Mali (Mali)_

In the framework of the EU activities in Africa, Slovenia participated with the presence of three
SAF members at the training mission for Malian armed forces (EUTM Mali), and thus
contributed to the training of Malian armed forces and thereby to the provision of defence
capabilities in Mali. Thus, Slovenia indirectly contributed to the stabilisation of security situation
in the country and also in the wider Sahel region, and at the same time demonstrated a
responsible attitude and awareness of the importance of responding to security challenges on
the African continent.

_EUFOR ALTHEA (Bosnia and Herzegovina)_

The SAF continued its participation in the EUFOR operation ALTHEA with 9 members. Slovenia
thus continued its military contribution to the strengthening of peace and security in Bosnia and
Herzegovina and to the joint efforts for the establishment of properly trained, professional and
efficient armed forces of that country. Activities of the Slovenian contingent were primarily
focused on the performance of staff and logistics support tasks, and on gathering information for
the operation on the situation on the ground. During the year, several training courses and
mentoring activities were also conducted for members of the engineering battalion of the Bosnia
and Herzegovina armed forces. From the beginning of July to the end of December 2014, a
motorized SAF company with 120 members, which participated in the mitigation of
consequences of major floods in Bosnia and Herzegovina in June, also became a part of the
regional reserve force of the EUFOR operation ALTHEA. With the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,
the MoD participated in the preparation of a common non-paper of nine EU member states in
support of the extension of the mandate of the operation.

**7.4 Humanitarian Operations**

_Mare Nostrum – Lampedusa (Mediterranean Area)_

The end of January 2014 saw the end of the one-and-a-half month participation of the SAF
multi-purpose boat Triglav 11 and the crew of approximately 40 members in the humanitarian
operation of the Italian Security and Defence Forces »Mare Nostrum«. In the spirit of solidarity,
Slovenia thus quickly and proactively participated in the response to the pressing problems in
relation to the immigration in the Mediterranean Sea. In this way, Slovenia was the first to
provide bilateral assistance to Italy and received very positive responses of the Italian and the
wider international public.

## PROTECTION AGAINST NATURAL AND OTHER DISASTERS

### 1 PREVENTION ACTIVITIES

One of the fundamental approaches of prevention activities is the provision of protection against
natural and other disasters, including fire protection and protection against drowning, at a
system level, which regulates the implementation of individual activities in line with the
normative acts for the broadest spectrum of professional and lay public.

As far as the operation of the RS Administration for Civil Protection and Disaster Relief
(ACPDR) is concerned, special attention was devoted to various forms of activities aimed at
education and raising the awareness of various target groups, primarily children, teenagers, the
broadest population target groups, with presentations of topics related to the protection against
natural and other disasters as well as personal and mutual protection. Emphasis was also
placed on the training of the expert public, namely the persons responsible for carrying out fire
protection measures, technical examiners of the installed active fire protection systems, fire
extinguisher repairers, lifeguards, persons qualified in water rescue, planners, fire-fighters and
others. The ACPDR informs the wider and expert public about the implementation of measures
in the fields of protection against natural and other disasters, fire protection and protection
against drowning, and about the novelties in these fields for the implementation of personal and
mutual protection measures.

In the field of fire protection, the Decree on Wildfires redefined, at the regulatory level, the
measures for the protection against wildfires during the declared wildfire hazard. The basic
principles were determined for the introduction of on-call fire-fighting service during the declared
very high fire wildfire hazard in certain areas, etc.

In the field of fire protection, conditions are being defined, as well as the manner for carrying out
individual fire protection measures and exercising the related powers for the inspection and
testing of fire extinguishers, hydrant networks and the installed active fire protection systems,
and for performing fire safety, and implementing fire protection measures. The prescribed tasks
are being carried out in the field of monitoring and declaration of wildfire hazard.

On the basis of fire protection public interest, 224 administrative cases were resolved, out of the
total of 232 received cases. The ACPDR participated in 76 procedures for the issuing of
operating permits for facilities for it which gave its consent to the building permit documents for
up to 2013.

In the field of protection against drowning, the ACPDR, in addition to introducing systemic
regulation of the field, carries out tasks related to physical and mental fitness of lifeguards and
persons qualified in water rescue, performs the testing of the training level, grants
authorisations for the implementation of the programmes for the training if lifeguards,
determines organisational measures for the protection against drowning in public bathing areas,
etc.

The ACPDR is one of the entities responsible for spatial management during the preparation of
national, inter-municipal and municipal spatial planning documents, and participates by issuing
guidelines and opinions in the field of protection against natural and other disasters and fire
protection. Spatial, urban, construction and other technical measures are implemented in the
course of spatial and urban planning and construction in order to prevent or mitigate harmful
effects of natural and other disasters and to facilitate protection, rescue and relief. In order to
provide fire protection measures during the preparation of spatial planning documents, provision
should be made for the safe evacuation of people, animals and property, necessary separation
between structures or the necessary fire protection separation, accesses, driveways and work
areas for emergency vehicles, as well as the resources for adequate supply of water for firefighting. In 2014, the total of 374 applications for issuing guidelines and opinions were received,
whereas 145 guidelines and 228 opinions on spatial planning documents in the field of
protection against natural and other disasters and fire protection were issued.

-----

For sheltering the population from war and other threats, basic protection shelters are being
built in certain buildings in the planning zones of cities and other settlements with more than
5,000 inhabitants, whereas floor plates above the lowest floor in all buildings should be
constructed so as to prevent the collapse. Shelters within buildings are built as double-purpose
facilities without jeopardising their protective function. In Slovenia, there are 2,244 basic and
supplementary protection shelters with the total of 348,573 places for people. The majority of
shelters are situated in urban centres.

Personal and mutual protection includes measures of the population for self-help and for the
provision of assistance to others. In the event of natural or other disasters, fire or risk of
drowning, personal and mutual protection includes activities involving non-compulsory forms of
training of the population, youth and children by providing current warnings and instructions for
the population, cooperating with the media and preparing various activities and materials to the
population. In October, which was the Fire Safety Month, activities for the planning of fire
protection measures were carried out for the population, aimed at the deaf and hard-of-hearing,
blind and partially sighted, deaf-blind and mobility impaired people. Several consultations were
carried out for the expert public and the promotion of the system, etc. Leaflets and posters were
issued and distributed, displaying information for the population on the implementation of
personal and mutual protection. Through the websites, media, different approaches and
publications, the MoD accessed a variety of target groups, young children, teenagers and
graduates. The MoD participated in the event called Children's Bazaar, organising, as every
year, puppet shows for children throughout Slovenia. Moreover, a web application was
developed. Through an optional subject, the topics from the field of protection against natural
and other disasters are included in the primary education, in the framework of which a literary
and art contest for pupils was prepared and carried out, as every year. More than 4,000 children
and over 700 mentors took part in the contest. The ACPDR also participates in other events for
children, teenagers and other population with various activities in the field of protection against
natural and other disasters.

In addition to the training of the population for carrying out personal and mutual protection, a
systematic training of the expert public is also taking place. In the field of fire protection, the
ACPDR organised several consultations for the expert public on the topic of wildfires, three
consultations titled »When the Fire Starts, Everybody Needs Help« with an emphasis on the
planning of fire protection measures for the deaf and hard-of-hearing, blind and partially sighted,
deaf-blind and mobility impaired people, consultation on the development of risk assessments
for individual disasters for the ACPDR regional offices and ministries, as well as a consultation
titled Rehabilitation Following a Nuclear Accident for first responders in the event of a nuclear or
radiological accident. The ACPDR also participated in training courses on the subject of
planning for regional Civil Protection headquarters, and in consultation organised by other
entities.

### 2 PREPAREDNESS OF THE SYSTEM OF PROTECTION AGAINST NATURAL AND OTHER DISASTERS AND PROTECTION, RESCUE AND RELIEF FORCES

**2.1 Disaster Response Planning**

Disaster response plans provide for an organised and coordinated operation to prevent
disasters or minimize their consequences. The ACPDR, which cooperates with the ministries in
the preparation of the national disaster response plans, submits those plans to the Government
for adoption and reports to the Government on the preparation of action plans which fall within
the responsibility of individual ministries. The Slovenian Government adopted the National
Disaster Response Plan in the Event of Earthquakes. Furthermore, the following plans were
updated: the National Disaster Response Plan in the Event of Aircraft Accidents, National
Disaster Response Plan in the Event of Floods, National Disaster Response Plan for Major
Wildfires, and National Disaster Response Plan In the Event of Terrorist Attack with Means of
Weapons of Mass Destruction, or with Conventional Means. The ACPDR, together with the
regional offices, updated the general annexes to disaster response plans. The ACPDR
participated in the international working group for the preparation of assumptions for the
amendment of the risk assessment for nuclear accidents in the Krško Nuclear Power Plant.

The RS Civil Protection Commander Defence Plan was brought in line with the new Decree on
Defence Planning. Furthermore, national preparedness measures were prepared, NATO crisis
response measures were supplemented, Plan for the Protection of the Security Area II was
updated, annual review was prepared, and the adequacy of classified documents was updated.

On the basis of the Decision on a Union Civil Protection Mechanism, in the field of development
of risk assessment, the Decree on the Implementation of the Decision on a Union Civil
Protection Mechanism was adopted, stipulating the types of risk assessments for disasters,
authorities responsible for the development of risk assessments for disasters and their tasks,
contents and development of risk assessments for individual disasters, contents of the National
Risk Assessment for Disasters, manner of adoption and public nature of risk assessments for
disasters, deadlines for the development of risk assessments, etc. As the national coordination
body, the ACPDR prepared a number of supporting documents for the development of risk
assessments, and carried out consultations, monthly joint thematic coordination meetings,
coordination activities with individual departments, etc. In relation to ex-ante conditionality, the
development of risk assessments is associated with the Partnership Agreement between
Slovenia and the European Commission on the Absorption of the European Structural and
Investment Funds in the Period 2014–2020. In connection with the implementation of the
Decision on a Union Civil Protection Mechanism, activities also started in the field of developing
risk management capability assessments and in the field of preparing and improving risk
management planning, where practically all ministries are actively involved, as in the case of
risk assessment. The ACPDR plays its role primarily in the field of system-related work,
coordination and development of joint national documents and reporting to the European
Commission.

The permanent annual distribution of potassium iodide tablets was carried out for the citizens
living within the diameter of ten kilometres around the Krško Nuclear Power Plant.

**2.2 Operational Planning and Preparedness**

Operational preparedness of the system of protection against natural and other disasters is
provided through continuous operation of notification centres and public rescue services, and
through the preparedness of other rescue services, commissions, units and civil protection (CP)
headquarters. Trained, equipped and motivated members of rescue services, commissions,
units and CP headquarters ensure an adequate and coordinated response to natural and other
disasters. The previously achieved preparedness to respond to natural and other disasters was
maintained. Of particular importance was the purchase of an additional decontamination trailer
and equipment for radiological detection, electronic and personal dosimetry and

decontamination for fire-fighting units of broader importance, which will undoubtedly positively

21/102


-----

affect the preparedness and responsiveness of the system during accidents with dangerous
substances.

The Programme for the Formation of National Material Reserves for Protection, Rescue and
Relief during the Period 2009–2015, which provides for the materiel and equipment from the
state reserves to help the population at risk and the affected people after natural and other
disasters, as well as personal and collective equipment for the operation of the protection,
rescue and relief (PRR) forces, was implemented to a smaller extent.

The ACPDR provides a comprehensive and responsive logistics system of 13 regional logistics
centres to support the protection, rescue and relief forces at the regional level, and of the
National Logistics Centre to support the national civil protection units.

**2.3. Monitoring, Notification and Warning**

Operational and communications tasks regarding monitoring, notification and warning are
carried out continuously 24 hours a day and 365 days a year by the National Notification Centre
(NNC) and 13 regional notification centres (RNC) responding to the emergency call number
112. The operation of the RNC ensures the availability of emergency medical assistance, rapid
activation of rescue workers, mostly fire-fighters, and appropriate response of different rescue
services during natural and other disasters for all citizens. For 90 percent of all calls, the
average response time of operators in regional notification centres was less than seven
seconds. The majority of calls were received at the Ljubljana Regional Notification Centre,
which are 390 calls per day on average. This was followed by the RNC in Maribor with 185 calls
per day, RNC in Celje with 162 calls per day and RNC in Kranj with 160 calls per day. The
majority of calls in a single day were received on 2 February, which is 9,538 calls, followed by 3
February with 6,371 calls and 13 September with 5,523 calls. 76 percent of calls by Slovenian
and 3 percent of calls by foreign users were received through mobile operator networks,
whereas 21 percent of calls were received from traditional (PSTN and ISDN) and IP phones.

**2.4 Communications and Information Systems (CIS)**

The development of equipment for the reception of automatic emergency calls from the e-Call
vehicles was completed. The inspection of equipment was carried out throughout Slovenia. All
the necessary equipment was installed in the notification centres. If the necessary financial
resources are provided, the system will be in regular operation in 2015.

The system of the back-up power supply of the ZARE communications system was renewed, 5
additional repeater stations were set up and 13 mobile repeater stations were purchased. The
renewal of the system of the back-up power supply increased the autonomy of operation of the
ZARE communications system in the event of power failure. Some protection, rescue and relief
units will be equipped with mobile repeaters, thus providing additional communications during
major natural and other disasters.

Due to lack of funds, the computerisation of response procedures in the notification centres with
the SIPod application was not carried out. The aim of these processes was to shorten the
response times during emergency response activities and to enable automatic exchange of
information obtained during the call with all rescue services.

The renewal of the public warning system was also not carried out to the extent planned; of the
planned 99 sirens, only 8 sirens were actually purchased.

Slovenia participated in the European projects HeERO and ESA-IDRC. Within the HeERO
project, Slovenia participated as an associated partner. It gained access to data and information
related to the process of the introduction of automatic emergency calls from the e-Call vehicles
in the EU. Based on these data, Slovenia developed equipment for the reception of calls and
carried out practical testing throughout Slovenia. Within the ESA-IDRC project, Slovenia
participated as a representative of end users in the testing and collection of data for the upgrade
of the EMERGENCY.LU module.

**2.5 Protection, Rescue and Relief Forces**

In 2014, 14,549 different events happened in Slovenia (natural and other disasters, traffic
accidents, fires and explosions, pollution, accidents with dangerous substances, nuclear and
other events, findings of unexploded ordnance, supply disruptions, damage to facilities and
technical and other assistance). In addition to other services, the protection, rescue and relief
forces also responded to those events.

_Events in 2014_

**Event** **Number of Events**

Natural Disasters 1,957

Other Disasters 1,201

Traffic Accidents 2,270

Fires and Explosions 3,598

Pollution, Accidents Involving Dangerous Substances 655

Nuclear and Other Events 5

Findings of UXO, Supply Disruptions and Damage to Facilities 850

Technical and Other Assistance 4,013

**Total** **14,549**

_Note: Data on events in 2014 are based on the reports completed by 29 January 2015._

A closer look at the events reveals that the accidents resulted in 22,037 emergency response
operations, with the participation of 147,439 members of various protection, rescue and relief
forces. The majority of emergency response operations took place in February (5,206), followed
by September (2,201), March (1,660) and August (1,615). The majority of emergency response
operations were carried out by the voluntary territorial fire-fighting societies, professional firefighting units, National Unit for Protection from unexploded ordnance (UXO) and Mountain
Rescue Association of Slovenia. With timely and effective response and help to those affected,
protection, rescue and relief forces undoubtedly contributed to the mitigation of damage and
other consequences caused by these disasters.

-----

The major part of problems and the highest number of emergency response operations was
caused by sleet, deep snow and floods. These disasters affected the entire country. Heavy
rainfall occurred in two periods in January and caused trouble and floods. The next event with
heavy rainfall, which extended from the end of January to the first days of February, brought
atmospheric inversion, as well as sleet. The latter affected a major part of Slovenian territory,
with the record thickness of more than 5 cm in some areas. Thunderstorms with heavy rains
started as early as in May, whereas in August, Slovenia was hit by as many as four events
including heavy rainfall and strong wind. Thunderstorms with heavy rainfall ravaged from 9 to 14
September. At the end of October, warm sea also caused storms with heavy rainfall. At the
beginning of November, the country was affected by another heavy rain which caused flooding.

Based on the Decree on Civil Protection Service, the ACPDR, as the founder, organises Civil
Protection units, services and bodies to perform protection, rescue and relief tasks at the
national and regional levels, and prepares plans for the conclusion of contracts of service in the
Civil Protection, in accordance with the decision stipulating priority manning with contract Civil
Protection members. Budgetary constraints and the reduction of resources for the field of
protection against natural and other disasters affected the manning of Civil Protection with
contract members, and influenced the decision on the further reduction of the on-call allowance
for 10 percent (from 14 July 2014). In 2014, conditions were thus created for further manning of
Civil Protection units, services and bodies.

As a priority, contracts of service in the Civil Protection were concluded for the manning of Civil
Protection units, services and bodies: unit for search and rescue in urban areas, logistics and
psychological assistance unit. Three new contracts were concluded, along with 19 annexes for
the extension of contracts and three annexes which did not extend contracts. Together with
three new contracts, the ACPDR has concluded 116 contracts of service in the Civil Protection
for the most critical duties, which is far from covering all the needs and thus from reaching the
planned capabilities.

At the end of the year, the Civil Protection records listed more than 40,000 members of
protection, rescue and relief forces, of which approximately 22,000 were members of duty units
and 18,000 were volunteers. The protection, rescue and relief forces at the national level
included 840 professional members, 1,200 voluntary members and 1,505 members of duty
units.

**2.6 Protection From Unexploded Ordnance**

Protection from UXO is organized as a single measure throughout Slovenia and comprises
detection, identification, disposal, transportation, storage and destruction of UXO, and the
training of members of the National Unit for Protection from UXO. In 2014, the National Unit for
Protection from UXO carried out 485 emergency destructions (on average 1.3 a day), in which
8,690 pieces of various UXO were disposed (on average 23.8 pieces a day), or 14,543.76 kg
(on average 39.81 kg a day). In addition to regular destructions of UXO at the Poligon 208
Protection and Rescue Training Range (from 22 to 24 May 2014), where 7149 pieces of UXO
with the total weight of 4,230 kg were destroyed, it is important to point out the emergency
destruction of an air bomb in Maribor in August 2014, relocation of five LMB sea mines to a
specific point of disposal, and the removal of two sea mines (UMB and BOLLO) from the
Slovenian sea in June 2014, nine land inspections ordered by investors or operators, and 28
on-site destructions, when 129 pieces of UXO with the total weight of 990.36 kg were
destroyed. The measure of protection from UXO was carried out by 32 voluntary Civil Protection
members.

_Inspection and Transport of Sea Mines_

**2.7 Provision of Conditions for the Operation of Protection, Rescue and Relief Forces**

The operational part of the system of protection against natural and other disasters is primarily
based on voluntary rescue services and other structures organised by associations and NGOs.
The subsidy provided by the ACPDR represents over 75 percent of the total funds required for
the operation of individual units. Such operation includes continuous training and practice of unit
members, members’ medical examinations and insurance policies, payment of salaries and
reimbursements for the loss of income to employers during the call-up of members, purchase
and maintenance of their collective and personal protection and rescue equipment, and material
costs of emergency response operations.

_Co-Funding Rescue Services, Associations and Other Organisations_
Co-funding of the activities of services, associations, units, companies, institutes and other
organisations active in the field of protection, rescue and relief was carried out on the basis of
the established criteria, provided funds, through contracts or annexes to contracts for cofinancing the protection, rescue and relief activities amounting to EUR 7,725,892. These funds
ensured the operational preparedness of professional rescue services, fire-fighting units of
general importance, associations and other organisations, and rescue services and structures
which operate on the voluntary basis. Part of these funds (EUR 1,697,180) was dedicated to
ensuring a coordinated development of fire-fighting units within the voluntary fire-fighting
associations, namely the modernization of protection and rescue equipment.

Annexes to contracts amounting to EUR 1,795,689 were concluded with the Mountain Rescue
Association of Slovenia, Cave Rescue Service of the Speleological Association of Slovenia,
Slovenian Kennel Club, Slovenian Diving Federation, Slovenian Red Cross, Slovenian Catholic
Girl Guides and Boy Scouts Association, Scout Association of Slovenia, National Institute of
Biology, Institute of Occupational Safety, Faculty of Medicine – Institute of Microbiology and
Immunology, Faculty of Medicine – Forensic Identification Unit, Veterinary Faculty – Institute of
Microbiology and Parasitology, Jožef Stefan Institute, Velenje Coal Mine, TKI Hrastnik
(chemical products factory), National Laboratory of Health, Environment and Food, Institute of
Occupational Safety Ljubljana, Slovenian Professional Fire-Fighter Association, Association of
Societies and Clubs of Rescue Dog Handlers of Slovenia, Association of Radio Amateurs of
Slovenia, CB Radio Club Soča and the following flying clubs: Josip Križaj Ajdovščina, Postojna,
Tolmin, Zagorje ob Savi, Coastal Flying Centre Portorož, Slovenj Gradec Airport, and Kras
Flying Centre Divača.

_Co-Funding of the Fire-Fighting Association of Slovenia_
Based on the annual programme of activities and tasks of the Fire-Fighting Association of
Slovenia, such as organisational activities, prevention activities, fire-fighter training, and
publication of professional literature in accordance with the Fire Service Act and the Fire
Protection Act, an annex to the contract was concluded with the Fire-Fighting Association of
Slovenia in the amount of EUR 450,000.

In addition, the ACPDR allocated EUR 69,500 for anniversaries of voluntary fire-fighting
societies, and EUR 57,500 to assist fire-fighting units in the purchase of protection and rescue
equipment.

_Programme of Co-Funding Fire-Fighting Units of General Importance_
Protection, rescue and relief tasks of wider importance, which include rescue after traffic,
industrial and other accidents involving dangerous substances, rescue after accidents in longer
motorway and other road and railway tunnels, technical rescue tasks after traffic accidents and
accidents in standing and flowing waters, and other protection, rescue and relief tasks of
general importance, are carried out by 45 fire-fighting units of general importance (FUGI). For
the smooth conduct of activities of general importance, data on influence factors in operational
areas (new roads and tunnels) as well as dual activation areas of FUGI were updated and
complemented, taking into account double-overlap areas. Moreover, plans for 2014 and reports
on the utilisation of funds for 2013 were evaluated, and 46 annexes to contracts were prepared.

The programme of co-funding of FUGI was fully implemented and amounted to EUR 2,876,000.
Of that amount, EUR 170,034 was allocated to the amortisation of eight special fire-fighting
vehicles for tunnel rescue, and EUR 90,000 to the co-funding of the fast technical rescue
vehicle for the Voluntary Fire-Fighting Society Murska Sobota. The rest of the funds were
divided among units, in line with the criteria for the allocation of funds.

An in-depth analysis was made of the temporal coverage of the activities of general importance
on the basis of data from the information system for reporting on disasters and emergency
response operations (SPIN) for the period between 2010 and 2014, as well as graphical
simulations of driving times from the FUGI headquarters to the nearest FUGI (taking into
account the actual driving conditions, such as speed limits, etc.).

_Emergency Rescue in Long Road and Motorway Tunnels_
On the basis of contracts for the performance of operational tasks in the event of road tunnel
accidents, concluded between the Motorway Company of the Republic of Slovenia (MCRS), the
MoD and individual fire-fighting units (Jesenice Fire and Rescue Service (GARS Jesenice),
Domžale Fire Safety Centre (CPV Domžale) and Celje Professional Fire-Fighting Unit (PGE
Celje)), a total of EUR 65,499 was paid for the co-financing of the maintenance and restoration
of personal protective equipment, insurances and transport costs for tunnel fire-fighters.

In cooperation with the Fire-Fighting Association of Slovenia, a purchase was made of the
collective equipment of portal fire-fighters in the amount of EUR 250,000.

_Co-Funding of Fire-Fighting Protection and Rescue Equipment_
In 2014, the CPDR continued with the modernisation of protection and rescue equipment of firefighting units in voluntary fire-fighting societies, and thus with the provision of harmonious
development of these units. A total of 521 applicants responded to this tender notice. A total of
481 co-funding contracts in the amount of EUR 1,697,180 were concluded.

_Protection and Rescue Operations at Sea_
The procedure was carried out for the conclusion of a contract on co-funding protection and
rescue operations at sea with the company Adria TOW d.o.o. (towing services and assistance
to ships and vessels) in the amount of EUR 28,725.

**2.8 National Material Reserves for the Event of Natural and other Disasters**

In previous years, Slovenia started to establish national material reserves (NMR), primarily for
large-scale disasters, wildfires, floods, major hailstorms, communicable diseases, etc. The
implementation of the Programme of Establishing NMR for Protection, Rescue and Relief in the
period 2009–2015 ensures materiel and equipment from national reserves to help the affected
population and the population at risk after natural and other disasters, as well as personal and
collective equipment for the activities of the protection, rescue and relief forces.

Technical documents for the establishment of NMR and the equipping of protection, rescue and
relief forces were prepared, in accordance with the plan and on the basis of the provided funds.
The realization of the planned public procurements was smaller than initially planned due to the
supplementary budgets, unsuccessful harmonisation of technical documents and the fact that
some contracts were not awarded. Of the 30 proposals, 28 were realised, which in financial
terms means a 93.34 percent realisation. The reduction of funds under the budget heading also
means the worsening of conditions for the maintenance of preparedness and adequate
equipping of protection, rescue and relief units and services, and for appropriate response after
disasters.

Resources and equipment of PRR units and other forces were supplemented in order to provide
and maintain the adequate level of equipping and operational preparedness of units for their
response to natural and other disasters in Slovenia and abroad. Despite the reduction in funding
for national reserves resulting from the supplementary budget, Slovenia purchased portable
beds with folding mattresses, bedding and pillows, residential containers, equipment for
assistance at sea, equipment for the detection and removal of UXO and equipment for the
Medium Search and Rescue Unit and the technical rescue unit. In addition, the maintenance of
the equipment in the national reserves and units was provided.

**2.9 Commodity Reserves**

Each year, the ACPDR cooperates with the Agency of the Republic of Slovenia for Commodity
Reserves in the development of the annual programme for the purchasing of protection and
rescue equipment in the framework of commodity reserves. The proposal of the Programme for
the Establishment of National Commodity Reserves with Means of Personal and Collective
Protection was prepared pursuant to the Decree on Means and Equipment for Personal and
Collective Protection. Personal and collective protection equipment, included in the Commodity
Reserve Programme, was selected and planned to be used in the shortest time possible, and
suitable for mass use.

27/102


-----

At the end of 2013, the Government adopted a new five-year programme for the establishment
of national commodity reserves for the period from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2018, with
a special emphasis primarily on maintaining and supplementing the national commodity
reserves (hence also personal and collective protection equipment). During the planning of the
programme, financial capacity of the national budget and the Agency was taken into account, as
well as possibilities for the resupply of commodities.

Due to the lack of funding, the Board of Directors of the Agency of the Republic of Slovenia for
Commodity Reserves did not adopt the work programme and the financial plan for the purchase
of personal and collective protection equipment for 2014. By the end of 2014, only public
procurements that were not carried out in 2013 (purchase of chemical detectors as well as
resources for the replenishment of personal decontamination kits) could be realised. In addition,
pursuant to Ordinance of the RS Civil Protection Commander during natural disaster including
sleet in February 2014, the funds allocated for the purchase of personal and collective
protection equipment were also used for the purchase of power generators and a cargo trailer in
order to mitigate the disaster consequences.

**2.10 Delivery of Fire Fund Assets and Vehicles to Voluntary Fire-Fighting Societies**

In the area of logistics, pursuant to the Physical Assets of the State and Local Government Act
and with the purpose of fulfilment of public interest in the area of protection against natural and
other disasters, the following was transferred free of charge to voluntary fire-fighting societies:
10 vehicles, five generators, three radio stations, two iron cabinets for storing equipment, 193
pneumatic tyres of various dimensions, eight life jackets, six manual radio stations, an electric
submersible pump and 10 fire brooms.

In accordance with a contract, 426 radio stations were transferred free of charge to the
Mountain Rescue Association of Slovenia.

In 2014, in line with the decision of the Committee for the Management of the Fire Fund Assets,
a total of 2,253 pieces of various fire-fighting equipment and communication resources,
purchased through the Fire Fund in the past years, were transferred to the Fire-Fighting
Association of Slovenia.

**2.11 Fire Tax**

Eligible use of fire tax funds is laid down in Article 59 of the Fire Protection Act. The use of
funds for general social importance is in the hands of the Committee for the Fire Fund
Management (the Committee), in accordance with the annual plan for the use of the fire tax
inflow, which in 2013 amounted to EUR 7,700,536. The Fire Fund assets ensure a better fire
safety in local communities. The share of fire tax funds for local communities in the amount of
70 percent was determined by a Government decision and totalled in EUR 5,393,467.

In accordance with the plan for spending the fire tax funds inflow adopted by the Committee and
based on the decision of the RS Government, 30 percent of fire tax revenue was allocated to
the tasks of general importance: co-financing of equipment, co-financing of operation and
equipping of fire-fighting units, co-financing of research in the field of fire protection, and
education and training for fire protection. The purchase and distribution of means and
equipment upgrades and improves the equipping of fire-fighting forces. Part of the means was
also dedicated to the protection, rescue and relief activity in the field of fire protection, carried
out by the Fire-Fighting Association of Slovenia, which is the provision of and care for further
development and education and training of voluntary fire-fighting forces in Slovenia.

The distribution of means equalled 70 percent of monthly inflow of fire tax funds. In 2014, 93
percent of the Fire Fund Annual Plan was realised. As administrative support to the Committee,
the ACPDR placed particular emphasis on the realization and preparation of technical
characteristics and specifications of equipment intended for purchase through the public
procurement system. The unrealized projects include research and development projects,
command vehicle equipment and co-financing the purchase of fire engines for high altitude
rescue.

28/102


-----

In 2014, several high-value and several low-value public procurement procedures were carried
out for:

  - Purchase of communication resources in the amount of EUR 88,678.

  - Purchase of thermal video cameras in the amount of EUR 259,786.

  - Purchase of barriers for the prevention of marine pollution on the reels and oil
containment boom in the total amount of EUR 101,202.

  - Purchase of the Pekre SCBA training area in the amount of EUR 50,101.

  - Purchase of equipment for the elimination of consequences of major floods in the
amount of EUR 104,267.

  - Purchase of fire-fighting equipment for wildfires (the Karst warehouse) in the amount of
EUR 77,294.

  - Costs of fire-fighting school and the purchase and maintenance of equipment in the
amount of EUR 192,495.

A public call for the co-funding of fire-fighting vehicles for the Karst was made, totalling in EUR
190,000. Six contracts were signed, namely with the following municipalities: Kobarid, HrpeljeKozina, Postojna and Tolmin.

The co-financing was carried out for the training of operational voluntary fire-fighters in the
amount of EUR 538,661, and for medical examinations of fire-fighters before the training in the
use of self-contained breathing apparatuses (SCBA), totalling in EUR 1,150,000.

**2.12 Research and Development in the Field of Protection against Natural and other**
**Disasters**

In the field of fire protection, no research and development project was selected, and the
procedures for the projects already selected in the previous two or three years have not started
yet. The reason is related to the process of carrying out the public invitation to tender or to the
content-related and technical issues (called technical specification), as well as to the evaluation
of proposals for research and development projects in the process of carrying out public
procurement.

On the basis of the problems identified in the field of research and development projects, the
material on the topic of carrying out public invitation to tender and the use of the related
legislation was prepared. The material does not require the preparation of technical
specifications in the manner requested so far by the Logistics Directorate, which means that the
biggest problem related to the deadlock in the implementation of invitations to tender for
research and development projects has been eliminated.

Floods, deep snow and sleet between 30 January and 27 February 2014

Between 30 January and 27 February, floods, deep snow and sleet affected the municipalities
in Severnoprimorska, Gorenjska, Koroška, Notranjska, Ljubljanska, Zahodnoštajerska,
Vzhodnoštajerska, Podravska, Pomurska, Dolenjska, Posavska and Zasavska regions.

The Slovenian Environment Agency issued a timely forecast of the risk of floods, deep snow
and sleet, which enabled certain preparations before the onset of the disaster; however, the
disaster could not be prevented.

The consequences of the chain disaster which affected almost the entire country, were snow
and sleet damage, extensive blackout (153,400 households), impassability of roads, traffic
disruptions (particularly of the railway traffic), isolation of individual areas, destruction of forests
(40 percent), disruption of drinking water supply, and economic and other damage.

Depending on the needs and the size of the areas affected by the disaster, Civil Protection
commanders and headquarters in the majority of the affected municipalities and regions were
activated, along with the national Civil Protection commander and headquarters, voluntary firefighters, members of other PRR forces, the Police and the SAF. The National disaster response
plan for floods was activated on 1 February 2014. Over 60,000 members of the PRR forces,
soldiers, policemen and employees of public services and corporations participated in the
mitigation of disaster consequences. Public procurement procedures were carried out for the
maintenance of generators, and for the purchase of generators (together with the RS Agency
for Commodity Reserves), mobile repeaters and flood bags.

_The 2014 Sleet_

Due to extensive damage to overhead power lines and disrupted electricity supply for about 15
percent of the RS population, the RS Government requested European Union assistance in the
form of high-power generators on 2 February 2014. The response via the EU Civil Protection
Mechanism was quick and effective, since the first foreign units arrived in Slovenia as early as
on 3 February 2014. Between 3 and 14 February, an average of approximately 160 foreign
rescuers a day provided assistance to their Slovenian counterparts in the mitigation of disaster
consequences, while the total number of rescuers from abroad participating in the emergency
response included approximately 650 people. Slovenia received a total of 172 generators (83
high-power and 89 low-power generators), of which 72 were provided through the EU CP
mechanism and 100 at the bilateral level from 11 countries (Austria, Czech Republic, Croatia,
Italy, Hungary, Germany, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Serbia and the United States).

The costs of emergency response and emergency measures intended to prevent the increase
of adverse effects of the disaster totalled in EUR 40,055,984.

In accordance with the final analysis of the response to the disaster, which was prepared based
on partial analyses of the ministries, proposals for improving the responsiveness to disasters
were developed, including systemic, organisational, logistical, IT and operational measures at
all levels (national, regional and local).

Judging by the scope of that meteorological disaster, in which by far greatest inconvenience
was caused by freezing rain or sleet, the disaster ranks among the greatest natural disasters in
the long term, however, up until now, this is probably the worst and biggest sleet disaster. This
disaster was also exceptional in terms of the intensity of the consequences and the large scale
of injury and damage.

**3.2 Damage Assessment**

Damage assessment after natural and other disasters was carried out by qualified appraisers
according to the prescribed methodology and in parallel with the regular maintenance of the
AJDA application. To this end, there were several consultations on damage assessment after
drought and flood in 2013 as well as sleet in 2014 in all 13 regions (ACPDR regional offices),
which were attended by 353 members of regional and municipal commissions for damage
assessment. The damage assessment application AJDA was upgraded with a new price list for
roads and electrical infrastructure, with the purpose of quality collection and processing of data
for reporting.

In 2014, in accordance with the prescribed methodology, Rules of Procedure for the
Assessment of Damage and the Rules of Procedure on the Work of Regional Damage
Assessment Commissions after Natural and other Disasters, and based on the Decisions on the
Assessment of Damage to Property, damage assessment commissions at the local, regional
and national levels assessed consequences of sleet and floods in 2014.

In the same year, sleet affected the areas of the Gorenjska, Koroška, Notranjska, Ljubljanska,
Podravska, Posavska, Severnoprimorska, Vzhodnoštajerska, Zahodnoštajerska and Zasavska
regions. The estimated damage amounted to EUR 429,415,980. The total amount of the final

-----

Amendments to the Programme of basic training for performing protection, rescue and relief
tasks using aircraft were also prepared.

In the reporting period, 15 programmes were updated and three new programmes were
developed, whereas one programme was amended.

In the field of proficiency examinations of fire-fighters, detailed reviews of the contents and
literature of the proficiency examination for the commander or operational head of a fire-fighting
unit and the head of a fire-fighting unit were finalised and coordinated with the Slovenian
Professional Fire-Fighter Association and the Association of Fire-Fighting and Rescue
Institutes. Draft programmes of further training of candidates for the proficiency examination for
the commander or operational head of a fire-fighting unit and the head of a fire-fighting unit
were also prepared.

Rules amending the Rules on the Special Exams of the Professional Firemen were developed;
they were signed by the Minister of Defence.

**4.2 Conduct of Education and Training Courses**

The training of the 21th generation of candidates for the profession of fire-fighters was
conducted according to the appropriate training programme (no. 604-35/2012-9, dated 7
January 2013), which also includes Criteria for Testing the Physical and Mental Fitness of
Candidates during the Training for Professional Fire-Fighters.

The training took place between 6 January 2014 and 19 June 2014. It involved 33 candidates
coming from public fire-fighting institutes (40%), companies (24%), fire-fighting units of general
importance or voluntary fire-fighting societies (18%), state bodies (6%) and private attendants
(12%). 58 contracts for a copyrighted work and 7 work contracts were concluded for the
purpose of conducting the training courses, and the employees of the training centre (four from
the Fire-Fighting School and the head of the Department of Education and Training) were also
involved as lecturers or as instructors.

The training lasted 24 weeks or 911 teaching hours, of which 401 hours were dedicated to
theoretical and 510 hours to practical training.

In January 2014, in cooperation with the Slovenian Professional Fire-Fighter Association, a
consultation and workshop were carried out for fire-fighting units on emergency response in
road tunnels (presentation of the European Directive on Safety in Road Tunnels, the Karavanke
tunnel accident, the concept of tunnel and portal fire-fighters in double-tube tunnels and
emergency response plan for tunnels).

The workshop titled the Use of Improvised Incendiary Devices was carried out for SAF
members (27 participants).

The training for extinguishing fires in closed spaces was carried out for fire-fighters from Bosnia
and Herzegovina (18 participants).

According to the Plan of Education and Training for 2014, 63 different programmes were
published. All the planned training courses which had a sufficient number of enrolled candidates
were also conducted.

The ACPDR continued with the training of confidants in the framework of psychological support
to emergency responders in fire-fighting units and notification centres, regularly performed
supervisions for psychological support confidants, and started with the training in the area of
psychological support for the target group of operators in notification centres.

A working group developed guidelines for psychosocial support in emergencies, which are the
ACPDR's starting points for further discussion with the other participants (ministries and
services in the fields of psychology, social work, health, community, and others).

For primary school teachers who teach the elective subject on protection against natural and
other disasters, training on earthquakes was carried out in the e-classroom. 9 teachers
successfully completed the training. Throughout the year, teachers also exchanged information
and read about the new developments in the e-classroom for teachers. Teachers were also
offered professional support in the conduct of the subject. In the school year 2013/14, the
subject on protection against natural and other disasters was conducted in 20 primary schools,
with 244 pupils involved.

In the area training for protection against unexploded ordnance, the programme of
supplementary training of members of units for protection against unexploded ordnance was
updated. Supplementary training was conducted in the e-classroom (35 participants), and
information was regularly exchanged with the Bomb Disposal Section of the Police. Cooperation
continued with the 430[th] SAF Naval Division in the field of the exchange of information on
unexploded ordnance at sea. 16 presentations of the system of protection against unexploded
ordnance were carried out in primary schools and at other events in Slovenia, while the Training
Centre hosted 12 presentations of protection against unexploded ordnance, showing a
collection of unexploded ordnance.

For the first time, the ACPDR successfully organized and conducted two training courses
according to the new programme of supplementary training for rescuers form behind the sumps
of underground caves, so that participants could improve their knowledge of cave rescue and
technical diving with specialised knowledge they need during the rescue form behind the sumps
of underground caves. This is the only training programme of this type in Europe which, at the
national level, provides training to members of two different rescue services for rescuers behind
the sumps of underground caves, namely the members of the Technical Diving Unit and
members of the Cave Rescue Service. This is a very demanding training in terms of security
and organisation, requiring the participation of both the Technical Diving Unit and the Cave
Rescue Service. The training was conducted by instructors with a high level of knowledge and
experience in the cave rescue and technical diving, who are also members of the rescue
services.

In cooperation with the Health and Safety at Work Service, the ACPDR organised training for
the employees and for the CP members working with machinery.

For the ACPDR employees, a consultation titled Exercises in the System of Protection against
Natural and other Disasters was organised.

The system of protection against natural and other disasters and the role of the Training Centre
for Civil Protection and Disaster Relief were presented to students of the Faculty of Social Work
(95 students), Faculty of Criminal Justice and Security (75 students), Faculty of Social Sciences
(35 students) and Faculty of Medicine (100 students), pupils of the Slovenj Gradec Schools
Centre (80 pupils) and primary school pupils (239 pupils).

**4.3 Assessment of the Training Level and Exercises**

Exercises were planned and conducted in accordance with the Plan of Exercises in the Defence
System and the System of Protection against Natural and other Disasters in the years 2013 and
2014, which was adopted by the Slovenian Government. For each exercise, documents which
are specified in the Rules on the Exercises in the Field of Protection against Natural and other
Disasters were prepared, namely a decision on the preparation of the exercise, exercise
conduct plan, analysis and exercise report.

Exercises of National Importance:
Two exercises of national importance were planned and carried out:

  - A two-day combined (theoretical and practical) exercise for comprehensive assessment
of the preparedness for the event of a nuclear accident, the Krško NPP 2014 exercise,
was conducted under the scenario that a fault in the operation of the Krško NPP caused
an incident which required the activation of the disaster response plans and the
response according to plans. The focus of the exercise was on the staff work,
management and decision-making. All the exercise participants operated at their
locations. The exercise took place between 26 and 27 November 2014.

-----

  - A one-day theoretical exercise for comprehensive assessment of the preparedness for
the event of floods, the exercise Mura 2014 was conducted due to the floods which
affected the municipalities involved in the exercise in autumn. It was conducted in the
form of an analysis of the autumn floods with proposals for improving the response to
floods in the Pomurje area. The analysis was conducted on 3 December 2014 in
Murska Sobota.

The following exercises were planned and carried out at the regional level:

  - A one-day theoretical exercise for comprehensive assessment of the preparedness for
the event of the collapse of water dam, Exercise Golica 2014, was conducted on 15
May as a staff exercise, with the participation of CP headquarters of the municipalities
which could be affected by the collapse of the water dam, and of the regional CP
headquarters for the Koroška region.

  - A one-day theoretical exercise for comprehensive assessment of the preparedness for
the event of a large-scale accident on the motorway, the Štajerska Motorway 2014
exercise, was carried out on 12 November. The exercise involved all the services
responsible for carrying out the protection, rescue and relief tasks according to plans.

  - A one-day combined (theoretical and practical) exercise for comprehensive assessment
of the preparedness for response to an aircraft accident, the exercise Aircraft Accident
2014, was conducted on 11 October. The exercise involved PRR units provided for
response to an aircraft accident in the Gorenjska region.

  - A planned one-day practical exercise for comprehensive assessment of the
preparedness for the event of the spillage of hazardous material, exercise Vogršček
2014, was conducted on 14 June on the Soča river as the exercise Soča 2014, with the
same task of the assessment of preparedness for response to the spillage of hazardous
material into the watercourse. The exercise involved PRR forces specified in the plans.

  - A one-day combined exercise for comprehensive assessment of the preparedness for
the event of large-scale accident on the motorway, the Trebnje–Novo mesto Motorway
2014 exercise, was carried out on 12 April as a practical and theoretical exercise. The
consequences of the large-scale traffic accident were mitigated by the PRR units of the
Dolenjska region.

Due to the uncompleted construction of the Markovec tunnel, a one-day combined exercise for
comprehensive assessment of the preparedness for the event of large-scale accident in the
Markovec tunnel, Exercise Markovec 2014, was postponed to 2015.

Regional Exercises and the 20[th] National Examination of the Training Level of the Civil
Protection and Red Cross First Aid Teams
Eleven regional examinations of the training level of the CP and RK first aid teams were carried
out. The examinations were attended by 125 first aid teams, organized in accordance with the
Regulation on the Organisation, Equipment and Training of Protection, Rescue and Aid Forces.
The national examination was attended by teams which were ranked among the best in the
previous regional training level examinations for first aid teams, as well as the best runner-up
team of regional examinations in 2014. 14 first aid teams qualified for the national examination,
namely seven RK teams, four CP teams and three teams of fire-fighting organisations.

The 20[th] national examination of the training level of the CP and RK first aid teams was
prepared based on the threat assessment of the Obalna Regija region and the actual
involvement and administration of first aid in the event of natural and other disasters. The
examination took place in Koper. Special emphasis was on the administration of first aid to
people injured in natural disasters (earthquake, flood, and sleet), the provision of first aid during
public events and large-scale accidents, and on the administration of first aid in the event of
drowning.

Among the participating teams, the highest level of knowledge and training was demonstrated
by the Slovenian Red Cross – Grosuplje Regional Association Team, which will represent
Slovenia at the First Aid Convention in Europe - FACE in 2015.

**4.4. Research and Development in the Area of Protection against Natural and other**
**Disasters**

In 2014, no research and development project was carried out in the area of protection against
natural and other disasters. The results were integrated into the work processes and information
was provided for the local communities and the public. The bases for the tender in 2015 were
prepared. Proposals were prepared for the implementation of the following projects: the
Upgrade of Protection against Disasters on the Dams with Approximate Determination of the
Consequences of their Collapse - VODPREG 2; the Upgrade the System for Determining the
Seismic Threat and Responsiveness for the Needs of Civil Protection and Disaster Relief in the
RS – POTROG 2; the Upgrade of the System for Notification and Warning in the Event of
Landslides – MASPREM 2; and the Assessment of the Consequences and the Necessary PRR
Forces and Resources in the Event of Floods with a 10-, 50-, 100- and 500-year return period POPSILE.

Applications from the results achieved in the projects were published on the ACPDR web portal.
Project results were used in international projects and presented at international conferences.
Results of the POTROG project were presented in 13 municipalities and at the ministry
responsible for energy.

### 5 INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION

In 2014, international activities in the field of protection against natural and other disasters were
primarily focused on the strengthening of bilateral cooperation and regional integration, the
provision of development assistance to the Western Balkan countries, and the ensuring of an
active role of Slovenia in international organisations. The most important were the activities for
strengthening the EU Civil Protection Mechanism. Slovenia provided extensive international
assistance during major natural and other disasters abroad (floods in Serbia, Bosnia and
Herzegovina and Croatia). During heavy sleet, Slovenia also received international assistance
form several countries. The ACPDR successfully participated in 11 European projects in the
field of protection against disasters.

**5.1 Bilateral Cooperation**

In 2014, Slovenia continued its strengthened cooperation with the neighbouring countries
Austria, Croatia, Italy and Hungary, particularly in the border area and in the framework of
European projects.

In cooperation with Austria, in the framework of the GOAL project, cross-border cooperation
between emergency response forces and bodies responsible for response during natural and
other disasters in the Austrian Carinthia and Austrian Styria and the Gorenjska and Koroška
regions was upgraded, and a major exercise Floods Carinthia 2014 was conducted; joint
training courses for rescue units were carried out. The operation of two contact committees was
re-established: Slovenia–Carinthia and Slovenia–Styria, in the framework of which the two
countries committed themselves to cooperate even more closely also in the field of protection
against natural and other disasters. The Permanent Mixed Commission for Protection against
Disasters (together with Croatia), and its four sub-commissions (for education and training, fire
protection, coordination of disaster response plans and cooperation in the field of emergency
call number 112) successfully carried out their work. With Croatia, Slovenia also signed the
Standard Operating Procedure on Assistance with Aircraft in the Event of Open-Space Fire.
Activities with Hungary took place mainly through the sub-commission on border cooperation,
where special attention was paid to notification and response to floods, both within the project
Let's Rescue Together 2015 and within the Mura 2015 project, which also included the
participation of Croatia and Austria. Slovenia also carried out sound border cooperation with
Italy, including within the GEP project, and at the national level in the context of other European
projects.

Special attention was devoted to the transfer of knowledge and experience to the Western
Balkan countries in the form of development aid, especially through the IPA CP II project in the
field of civil protection. The Letter of Intent on Cooperation in the Field of Protection against
Natural and other Disasters was signed with Serbia.

In the context of successfully implemented programmes of bilateral cooperation with France,
Sweden and the USA, the Slovenian representatives gained a lot of expertise. Slovenia also
successfully cooperated with Germany in the framework of several European projects.

**5.2 Regional Cooperation**

The ACPDR contributes to the strengthening of regional cooperation in the field of protection
against disasters, primarily through the IPA CP II project, which is aimed at further development
of the systems within the region and the support of the Western Balkan countries and Turkey in
their integration into the EU Civil Protection Mechanism. The ACPDR continued its intensive
work in the context of the key regional Disaster Preparedness and Prevention Initiative for
South Eastern Europe (DPPI SEE). In December 2014, the RS Government adopted a decree
on the ratification of the Memorandum of Understanding for the Institutional Framework of the
DPPI SEE, which constitutes the legal basis for further operation of the initiative. In addition to
its annual financial contribution, the ACPDR, in cooperation with Croatia and Serbia, organised
two training courses: a course on the reduction of risks of disasters and a course on cave
rescue, while cooperating with professional support in several training courses. In the context of

43/102


-----

the Alpine Convention, the ACPDR participated in activities in the field of protection against
disasters, and in the framework of the Adriatic-Ionian Initiative mainly in the field of protection
against forest fires.

**5.3 Cooperation in the Framework of the EU**

Within the Civil Protection Committee, the ACPDR participated in negotiations for the
preparation of the implementing act - Decision on a Union Civil Protection Mechanism (for
modules, European Emergency Response Capacity, Emergency Response Coordination
Centre, Common Emergency Communication and Information System (CECIS), training and
exercises), which was adopted in September. Within the Council Working Group on Civil
Protection, the ACPDR participated in the development of decisions of the Council on
multinational modules, decisions on cooperation between civil protection and humanitarian aid,
decisions on a common approach to negotiations on Post-Hyogo Framework for Action in the
framework of the United Nations, and decisions on the assessment of capability for risk
management.

The ACPDR kept an active role in the EU Civil Protection Mechanism, which is the main
instrument for the coordination of member states' assistance in the event of major disasters.
The RS Notification Centre is involved in the Common Emergency Communication and
Information System (CECIS). Slovenian representatives attended trainings in accordance with
national quotas. Slovenia also participated in the working groups for modules, risk assessment
and training policy. An intensive process for the development of risk assessments for disasters
took place at the national level in accordance with the new European legislation. The ACPDR
also participated in in the field of major accidents involving dangerous substances (Seveso II
and III Directives), intentional sea pollutions, Single European Emergency Call Number and
elsewhere. An ACPDR delegation attended the meetings of the EU Civil Protection Directors
General in Athens in June and in Rome in September.

**5.4 European Projects**

The ACPDR work in the field of European projects was aimed at the implementation of on-going
projects, development and registration of new projects and the exchange of information about
opportunities for participation in projects of the participating stakeholders (rescue services, local
communities, etc.). One of the most intensive tasks in 2014 was the cooperation in the process
of preparing programme documents for funds from the European Structural and Cohesion
Funds and the European Territorial Cooperation programmes with Austria, Croatia, Italy and
Hungary, which continues in 2015.

The ACPDR participated in 11 projects, (co)financed from the European funds. The biggest
project which the ACPDR implemented as the leading partner was the EU Programme for
Strengthening the Cooperation with Candidate Countries and Potential Candidate Countries in
the Area of Civil Protection within the context of the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance –
the IPA CP 2 Programme (duration between 2013–2015). In the framework of the project, a
comprehensive regional practical exercise QUAKE MNE IPA 2014 was conducted in October in
Montenegro, with the scenario of an earthquake, which brought together rescue units from nine
countries, including Slovenia. Several courses, staff exercises and exchanges of experts were
conducted. The project continues in 2015.

Together with its partners, the ACPDR successfully implemented three projects from the EU
Civil Protection Mechanism, courses for modules and technical experts (MBC – Modules Basic
Course and TEC – Technical Experts Course), exercises for civil protection modules and the
Projekt Mura 2015 project. The ACPDR also participated in the research project HeERO – the
introduction of the 112 emergency call service for vehicles. It was involved in three projects
within the European Territorial Cooperation: in the GOAL project – strengthening of crossborder cooperation of PRR bodies and forces with Austria; in the GEP project – joint geographic
information system (GIS) for the protection of drinking water during disasters in the border area
with Italy; and the project Let's Rescue Together – strengthening of cross-border cooperation of
PRR bodies and forces with Hungary. Within the Questcity education project, the ACPDR
participated in the upgrade of the computer application for young people for learning about
proper actions during disasters. As the end user, the ACPDR was involved in the project ESAIDRC: improving the ability to respond to disasters with satellite communications; as an
associate partner, it was also involved in the project SEERISK – cooperation in the field of risk
assessments in the Danube region. In addition, the ACPDR supported several projects in the
field of protection against disasters registered by other institutions.

In cooperation with its partners, the ACPDR successfully acquired four new European projects
(January 2015): the EU programme for prevention, preparedness and response to floods in the
Western Balkans and Turkey – IPA FLOODS; the Matilda Project – the establishment of
international modules for assessing post-earthquake threat and short-term implementation of
measures to support buildings. Within the framework of the Internal Security Fund, national
objective 6: Protection of Critical Infrastructure, the ACPDR will carry out two small projects in
2015. Within the official development assistance in the framework of the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs and in cooperation with its partners, the ACPDR will also carry out a bilateral project of
technical assistance in 2015 – Project for the Support of the Development of Voluntary Rescue
Services in Serbia.

**5.5 UN**

The ACPDR participated in UN activities for the implementation of the Hyogo Framework for
Action (HFA) for the period 2005–2015. Within that framework, it prepared the national report on
the implementation of HFA for the period 2011–2013 and information on the establishment of
the national platform for protection against disasters in Slovenia. The ACPDR also participated
in the annual meeting of the European Forum for Disaster Risk Reduction. It was involved in the
activities for the preparation of the Post-Hyogo Framework for Action for disaster risk reduction,
which will be adopted at the world conference in Japan in 2015. In December 2014, Kamnik
was, as the first Slovenian city, awarded the UN certificate Disaster-Resistant City and
Municipality. In accordance with its powers, the ACPDR fulfilled the obligations of the
Convention on the Trans boundary Effects of Industrial Accidents, and in this context, attended
the annual meeting and participated in the implementation of The Hague Convention and the
Barcelona Convention.

**5.6 NATO**

In the context of NATO, the ACPDR participated in the competent working bodies in the field of
civil protection and civil emergency planning, which adopted guidelines for strengthening the
resistance of countries to crises as well as natural and other disasters in 2014. Slovenia actively
supported greater involvement of partners in the activities in the field of civil protection, and the
establishment of links between NATO and other international associations and organisations.

**5.7 Assistance in the Event of Disasters Abroad**

Through the Emergency Response Coordination Centre of the European Commission in
Brussels, the ACPDR monitored all major natural and other disasters and crisis situations
around the world. Upon the request of the affected countries and following the decision of the
Government, Slovenia often rendered international assistance. During the floods in Serbia,
Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia, it offered the most extensive rescue and humanitarian
assistance abroad so far.

_May 2014._

From 17 to 31 May 2014, a total of more than 150 members of the PRR forces (fire-fighters and
members of the CP, SAF and the Police), operated in the flooded areas in Serbia and Bosnia
and Herzegovina. Members of the PRR forces were deployed to the affected areas through the
ACPDR under the EU Civil Protection Mechanism and were joined by 111 rescuers fire-fighters,
who were sent to the affected areas by the Slovenian municipalities in the framework of bilateral
assistance. Between 28 May and 14 June 2014, a Slovenian expert in the field of water
regulation was also involved in the international group for the assessment of the consequences
of catastrophic floods and development of the programme of rehabilitation in Bosnia and
Herzegovina. Slovenian psychologists participated in the training for first psychological
assistance to the population affected by the floods.

After severe sleet in February 2014, the RS requested international assistance in the form of
power generators via the Civil Protection Mechanism. Eleven countries responded to the
request, and a number of border municipalities and other organisations from the neighbouring
countries demonstrated solidarity. To assist its population, Slovenia received a total of 172
power generators. In cooperation with municipalities, the ACPDR provided host nation support
(accommodation, meals, transportation, etc.) to more than 640 foreign rescuers who selflessly
helped the Slovenian rescuers also with other urgent tasks during the sleet disaster.

### 6 INSPECTION ACTIVITY IN THE FIELD OF PROTECTION AGAINST NATURAL AND OTHER DISASTERS

The Inspectorate of the Republic of Slovenia for Protection against Natural and other Disasters
(IRSPANOD) performs inspections of the implementation of regulations concerning the area of
fire protection, fire-fighting, protection against natural and other disasters and protection against
drowning. In compliance with the Minor Offences Act, the IRSPANOD also performs the
function of a minor offence authority in the above-mentioned fields. The IRSPANOD inspectors
participate in emergency response operations during natural and other disasters, as well as in
the investigation of the causes of fires. As evaluators, they participate in national and regional
emergency response exercises as well as in NATO and EU crisis management exercises. They
actively participate in the Inspection Board and in regional coordination.

In 2014, inspectors in the field of protection against natural and other disasters carried out 4,453
inspections. Fire protection inspections were carried out in buildings with a large number of
people and in facilities in which activities that may endanger workers and nearby residents take
place. Inspectors also supervised the construction of buildings and exercised control on the
basis of reports. The inspectors participated in a number of joint actions of different inspection
bodies on the level of regional coordination and of the Inspection Board. Moreover, inspectors
participated in fire-fighting emergency response operations and in determining the causes of
fires. Fire-fighting units were supervised with regard to meeting the prescribed medical fitness
standards for operational fire-fighters and for personal protective equipment.

In the area of protection against drowning, inspections of swimming pools, equipment lenders
and water activity organisers were carried out. Special attention was paid to organisers of
rafting and canyoning.

In the field of protection and rescue, inspections of companies representing a major source of
environmental risk were carried out, as well as inspections of UXO storage sites. Moreover,
inspections were carried out in municipalities and primary schools.

Based on the Minor Offences Act, the IRSPANOD carried out 2,124 inspections and issued 72
payment orders. Moreover, it introduced 42 procedures for the issuing of offence decisions, and
issued 2,008 offence warnings.

The IRSPANOD carried out the task of evaluating exercises of national importance in the field
of civil protection and disaster relief. Inspectors from the management of the IRSPANOD and its
branch offices, together with the other competent inspectors and experts from the field of health
care, fire-fighting and the Police, evaluated exercises of national and regional importance:
Trebnje–Novo mesto Motorway 2014, Soča 2014, Aircraft Accident Gorenjska 2014 and Krško
NPP 2014.

Due to the lack of inspectors in individual areas of the country and in order to ensure a uniform
scope of inspections in Slovenia (which, within the competence of the Inspectorate, provides a
uniform standard of safety for the citizens of Slovenia in the area of protection against natural
and other disasters), the year 2014 saw the continued implementation of the concept for the
provision of uniform criteria to perform inspections in Slovenia. The work of the Inspectorate
continued to be adapted in the field of administrative operations, where the ACPDR and the
Defence Affairs Directorate signed the Agreement on Cooperation in the Performance of Tasks
in the Field of Administrative Operations and Maintenance of Materiel in 2013. According to this
Agreement, the employees of the organisational units of the signatories perform tasks related to
the common administrative operations.

The employees of the inspectorate attended individual forms of consultations, seminars,
workshops etc. They mostly attended forms of training courses which were provided free of
charge by the Academy of Administration. The participants of the training transfer the acquired
knowledge to their co-workers.

## DEFENCE SYSTEM AND CRISIS MANAGEMENT

### 1 DEFENCE POLICY

**1.1 NATO**

In February and in June 2014, Ministers met in in Brussels in order to prepare decisions for the
NATO Summit. In March, Slovenia hosted the meeting of the Defence Policy Directors of the
NATO member countries in Ljubljana.

Discussions before the Wales Summit were mostly marked by the Ukrainian crisis and its
impact on the security of the Alliance. By contributing to the assurance measures, Slovenia
demonstrated the solidarity and unity of NATO to the Eastern Allies and at the same time made
every effort to ensure that the Readiness Action Plan (RAP) represented a broader response to
security challenges of the Alliance, both those from the East and those from the South and
Southeast. Slovenia advocated a gradual rise in defence spending in the event of economic
growth. It also actively promoted the continuation of NATO enlargement to the Western
Balkans, especially to Montenegro, as the most prepared candidate, in which the Slovenian
Embassy also performed the duties of the NATO Contact Point Embassy in 2014.

In Wales, the Readiness Action Plan was adopted, extending the implementation of the security
assurance measures for the Eastern Allies and strengthening NATO's readiness by enhancing
the intensity of military exercises and creating rapid deployable high-readiness forces which will
be able of rapid deployment to the East. The Allies adopted a commitment to stop the negative
trend of the declining defence spending and try to gradually rise this spending within the next
ten years in line with the economic growth. Key to this is that these new financial resources are
primarily focused on providing those capabilities that are lacking within the Alliance. Slovenia
expressed its willingness to cooperate within the Framework Nation Concept in one of the
Italian-led groupings. Slovenia also contributed to the intense and focused talks with
Montenegro.

**1.2 Common Security and Defence Policy of the EU (CSDP)**

The MoD actively contributed to the development and implementation of the EU Common
Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) and, by providing specific initiatives, represented
Slovenia's interests in the EU institutions and working bodies.

The EU was affected by the changed security situation in the immediate neighbourhood of the
EU (the Russian-Ukrainian dispute, ISIL, foreign fighters) and further financial cuts. The
decisions taken at the December European Council on security and defence were revised, and
the funding of military operations was revised. A new military operation was launched in the
Central African Republic, and the executive mandate of the EUFOR ALTHEA in Bosnia and
Herzegovina was extended.

Of particular importance was the outbreak of the Ebola virus in West Africa, which was
discussed at the meetings of the EU Defence Policy Directors and Ministers of Defence. In
order to help during the Ebola virus epidemics, Slovenia expressed its willingness to donate
seven flying hours in the context of the strategic airlift for the transport of medical personnel and
equipment from Europe to West Africa.

In 2014, a reorganisation of the European Defence Agency (EDA) took place. During the
meeting on 18 November, the Ministers approved the EDA budget for 2015, the level mount of
which was equal to that of the 2014 budget. Slovenia was active in the field of exchange of
spare aircraft systems, where the project agreement is expected to be signed, and in the field of
remote controlled aircraft systems, where Slovenia is in the final stage of signing a joint
investment program.

**1.3 Analysis of Implementation of the Medium-Term Defence Programme of the RS for**
**the Period 2013–2018**

In the area of defence planning, an analysis of the implementation of the medium-term
objectives set out in the Medium-Term Defence Programme of the RS for the Period 2013–2018
was carried out. The MoD also prepared an analysis of financial and human resources,
construction of military and civilian capabilities as well as construction, use and property
ownership of the infrastructure.

The analysis of the Medium-Term Defence Programme of the RS for the Period 2013–2018
revealed that by participating in the NATO defence planning, Slovenia achieved the
harmonization of the national and Allied planning cycle, which also means rationalization of
resources necessary for the implementation of the planning activities. The harmonisation of the
Allied and national planning cycles can also be seen in the concordance of national strategic
development and guidance as well as planning documents (Strategic Defence Review,
Resolution on National Security Strategy, RS Defence Strategy, Resolution on General LongTerm Development and Equipping Programme of the SAF up to 2025 and Medium-Term
Defence Programme of the RS for the Period 2013–2018) and the goals and ambitions of the
Alliance. Nevertheless, there is scope to further improve harmonization, particularly in terms of
increasing the level of realization of medium-term defence objectives.

The realization of medium-term defence objectives and the planned development of defence
capabilities (Medium-Term Defence Programme of the RS for the Period 2013–2018) are
strongly influenced by measures taken against financial and economic crisis in Slovenia. Due to
frequent revised budgets and the consequent reduction of defence spending in recent years,
development and modernization of the SAF have almost completely stopped. The reduction of
defence spending in Slovenia for more than a third when compared to 2010 very much affected
the planned development of important priorities of defence capabilities. Worrying is the very
small proportion of funds allocated to defence investments and modernization, which for now
represents only two percent of defence spending (instead of 20 percent in accordance with the
NATO criteria).

The findings of the analysis and of the NATO review are an important basis for the
implementation of defence reform corrections in achieving more rational and efficient solutions,
which will be reflected in the development of the new Medium-Term Defence Programme of the
RS for the Period 2015-2020.

**1.4 NATO Defence Planning Capability Review for Slovenia**

Review of results is the fifth step of the NATO Defence Planning Process (NDPP), which is
intended to review the implementation of the assigned capability targets in member states.
Within the fifth step, the Allies (through the Defence Planning Capability Survey – DPCS) report
on national targets, priorities and ambitions in the medium-term (2013–2023), inventory of
military and non-military capabilities potentially useful for the Alliance, presence in operations,
financial plans in the area of defence and the achieved results.

NATO Defence Planning Capability Review for Slovenia started in 2013 and continued in 2014
with a multilateral meeting of the Defence Policy and Planning Committee (DPPC), aimed at the
review of the planning of the Slovenian defence capabilities, which took place at the NATO
Headquarters in Brussels on 24 February 2014. At the meeting, which was held according to
the rule »consensus minus one«, the member states learned about the assessment of the
review of the Slovenian defence capability planning. Slovenia informed the participants of the
difficult challenges facing the Slovenian defence system, and of the need to stabilize the
defence sources. Although NATO recognized and positively assessed the important contribution
of Slovenia in international operations and missions, it clearly pointed out at the meeting in its
assessment of the capability review the current inability of Slovenia to meet political
commitments associated with the realization of the package of capability targets in June 2013.
NATO representatives characterised the reduction in defence spending for one third when
compared to 2010 as »dramatic«, since no defence system can sustain such reduction without
serious consequences.

Joint Defence Planning Capability Report, which includes a risk assessment and political
positions, was confirmed by the Defence Ministers at the meeting in June 2014.

**1.5 Unified Objectives of the Medium-Term Defence Programme and the MoD Business**
**Plan**

Entities responsible for the MoD defence and operational planning, in cooperation with all the
entities responsible for the planning areas, determined unified medium-term (specific) objectives
of the Medium-Term Defence Programme and the Business Plan. The unified objectives of the
Medium-Term Defence Programme and the Business Plan, aimed at achieving common
objectives of the MoD, resulted in the conceptual consolidation of the defence planning areas,
which is also reflected in in the reduction of the number of medium-term objectives. In addition,
in accordance with the principles of the defence planning, as defined in the Rules on the
Planning in the MoD, the cascading of objectives was insured, from the long-term objectives
(Resolution on General Long-Term Development and Equipping Programme of the Slovenian
Armed Forces up to 2025) and through the medium-term objectives (Medium-Term Defence
Programme) to the short-term objectives (Business Plan). The defined objectives also enable a
direct connection between the financial budget sources (called budget projects and measures)
and the medium-term objectives, and improve the measurement of effectiveness and efficiency
in their implementation. Unified objectives of the Medium-Term Defence Programme and the
MoD Business l Plan will be put into effect in the defence planning process with the
development of the new Medium-Term Defence Programme of the RS for the Period 2015–
2020 and the MoD Business Plans for 2016 and 2017.

**1.6 International operations and missions (IOM)**

MoD was actively involved in the national decision-making processes and also took part in the
decision-making processes at the international level regarding the participation in IOM. In its
activities, it took into account the principles of the Cooperation Strategy of the RS in IOM and
promoted enhanced inter-ministerial cooperation, more intense public diplomacy and
appropriate adaptation of the working and coordination processes in the field of IOM. At the
highest decision-making level of the MoD, the Coordination Group for IOM continued with the
practice of regular consultations and coordination activities regarding the participation in IOM. In
line with the Strategy, the MoD participated in the preparation of the regular annual report of the
RS Government to the National Assembly on the participation of Slovenia in IOM.

**1.7 Bilateral Cooperation**

On the basis of annual programmes, approximately 300 activities of bilateral defence and
military cooperation were carried out. For the purpose of rational use of human and financial
resources, these activities were planned as projects and were focused mainly on areas of
mutual interest and expected mutual benefits. The most intense cooperation was established
with the neighbouring countries, strategic partners within the Alliance and IOM, and with the
countries of the Western Balkans.

Upon the completion of the ratification process and the exchange of diplomatic notes, the
Agreement between the RS MoD and the Ministry of National Defence of Poland on Defence
Cooperation entered into force. The renewed agreement, which replaced the 1998 legal act,
takes particular account of the changed circumstances resulting from the fact that the two
parties have become members of international organisations, such as NATO and the European
Union. With the same purpose, the renewed agreement between the Slovenian MoD and the
Ministry of National Defence of Lithuania on cooperation in the defence field was signed.

Due to the early parliamentary elections and the appointment of a new defence minister, the
plan of minister's international activities in the field of bilateral cooperation was realised to a
lesser extent, and the majority of the activities was postponed. Only the official visit to Croatia
was carried out, and the ministers held a considerable number of shorter working discussions in
the margins of regional and multilateral events and conferences (particularly the

51/102


-----

Comprehensive Regional Ministerial (CRM), which took place in Montenegro in October.
Immediately after taking office, Minister Veber held a considerable number of courtesy and
introductory discussions with ambassadors and military diplomatic representatives accredited in
Slovenia, and addressed the entire military diplomatic corps as part of the regular annual
meeting. In the context of the above-mentioned discussions, particular emphasis was on the
possibilities of strengthening cooperation with individual countries in the field of defence
industry.

**1.8 Multilateral Cooperation**

In the field of military policy of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE),
the Ukrainian crisis was at the forefront in 2014 and affected the work of all committees and
working groups. As a response to the crisis, some unused provisions of the Vienna Document
and the Treaty on Open Skies were widely used. Thus, the Ukraine hosted a considerable
number of visits of inspectors from the participating countries, who observed unusual military
activities. According to the Treaty on Open Skies, a number of observation flights in the border
area between Ukraine and the Russian Federation were carried out. Through its participation in
the observation mission, its inspectors and performance of a joint observation flight over the
territory of the Russian Federation, Slovenia also made an important and successful
contribution to the efforts for the stabilisation of the situation.

Desiring to further rationalise regional activities and projects, the Slovenian MoD, which was
responsible for the conceptual design of the last year's Comprehensive Regional Ministerial
(CRM), offered active assistance, support and advice in the organisation of the 2014 CRM. The
second CRM, which took place in Montenegro, was attended by Minister Veber. Joint meetings
in the combined format of the Western Balkans and the enlarged South-eastern Europe may
become traditional, since Croatia has already announced that it will host the 2015 CRM.

In the margins of the November meeting of the EU Foreign Affairs Council, the defence
ministers of Slovenia, Italy and Hungary signed a renewed Agreement on the Multinational Land
Force (MLF), which will enhance their interoperability across the entire spectrum of operations,
simplify procedures for the accession of potential new partners, and enable project planning. At
the same time, intense joint training courses and exercises took place throughout the year,
mainly in order to accelerate the process of affiliation of the MLF to the NATO corps structure,
and to effectively prepare for the establishment of the EU battle group based on the MLF or
DECI (Defence Cooperation Initiative) in the first half of 2017.

The MoD maintained an active role in the establishment of the Balkan Medical Task Force
(BMTF), with Serbia as the framework nation and Skopje as the headquarters. Final
harmonisation of the text of the Agreement on BMTF was made, specifying the structure of the
unit and the contributions of individual countries. With a SAF officer, Slovenia will be present in
the BMTF headquarters, which is expected to be established in the second half of 2015.

The MoD maintains a recognizable presence in the Centre for Security Cooperation
(RACVIAC). A MoD civilian employee (secondant) performed the tasks of the head of the pillar
for the reform of the security sector. Being recommended and supported by the MoD, a
graduate of the Military Science study programme at the Faculty of Social Sciences began a
one-year practical training in RACVIAC in October, in the framework of the Erasmus+
Programme.

**1.9 Disarmament and Arms Control**

Consistently and in accordance with the set deadlines, the MoD reported on the fulfilment of
obligations arising from international agreements on disarmament and arms control. Individual
contributions were prepared and included in the national reports as well as sent to the
competent international organisations (UN, OSCE and EU).

52/102


-----

Since Slovenia was one of the first signatories to the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) in June 2013,
the MoD was particularly pleased to welcome the fact that this international legal act entered
into force in December 2014.

In the framework of the MoD, a Commission for the Control of Military Weapons and Equipment
Trade and of the Transfer of Defence Products is active, coordinating and monitoring the trade
of defence products in Slovenia.

**1.10 Defence Diplomacy**

In the context of the regular personnel replacements of the defence diplomatic representatives,
the defence attaché to Russia was replaced, and the mandate of the defence representative to
the UN came to an end. A vacant post of the visiting defence attaché, working as a non-resident
attaché in Croatia and Hungary, was also manned. Due to the compliance with the conditions
for the entitlement to old-age pension, the defence attachés in Italy and Serbia and the military
representative to the OSCE were replaced, and the mandate of the defence adviser in
Montenegro came to an end.

By the end of 2014, 36 military diplomatic representatives (attachés and their deputies) were
accredited in Slovenia. Montenegro closed its defence attaché office in Ljubljana. The remaining
resident attachés in Slovenia are the defence attachés of the US, Russia and China.

**1.11 Provision and Implementation of the Unified Operation of the NATO Registry System**
**in the Republic of Slovenia**

In 2014, the Central NATO Registry/EU Sub-Registry successfully coordinated the work and
ensured the operation of the NATO Registry System in Slovenia and the operation of the NATO
sub-registries and the EU sub-registry at the MoD. All conditions for the receipt, traceability,
sending and destruction of classified and official NATO and EU data were fulfilled in due course
and in full. The transport and transfer of NATO and EU classified and official data in Slovenia
and abroad for the needs of the MoD and also other ministries and public authorities in Slovenia
were successfully realised. The Central Registry, in cooperation with the national security
authority, fulfilled and upgraded the conditions for the compliance with the security principles
and security standards which Slovenia, as a NATO member state, has to satisfy in order to
ensure a unified level of protection for the data exchanged between the member states.

### 2 SLOVENIA’S CRISIS PREPARATIONS AND RESPONSE MEASURES

Since the entry into force of the Regulation on Defence Planning, the MoD carried out a number
of activities related to the supplementation or development of new legal bases in the field of
defence planning. It prepared guidelines for the entities responsible for defence planning in
Slovenia (general guidelines regarding the adaptation of defence plans, and specific guidelines
for individual topic areas), carried out information and coordination activities with the planning
bodies and provided them with technical assistance in the development of their defence plans
and the adaptation of the plan contents due to its harmonisation with the Regulation on Defence
Planning.

The harmonization of the contents of the MoD Defence Plan with the Regulation on Defence
Planning was also ensured, along with the update of the records under the responsibility of the
Ministry. With regard to the Doctrine of the Military Strategic Reserve of the RS, approved by
the Government at the end of 2012, and in accordance with the adopted schedule of the MoD,
the implementation of tasks in this field continued. The result of the doctrine are the solutions
and operational documents for the creation of the military strategic reserve, the purpose of
which is the provision and maintenance of SAF's sustainability in the military defence of
Slovenia and the fulfilment of international commitments under Article 5 of the North Atlantic
Treaty. The solutions represent a part of the contents of the MoD Defence Plan.

As the manager of the national defence plan, the MoD prepared information on the
harmonisation of defence plans with the Regulation on Defence Planning. The RS Government
was informed about this topic.

The National Crisis Management Centre (NCMC), as one of the important crisis management
mechanisms, provides spatial, organisational, technical and other conditions for the quick and
efficient operation of the Government and the inter-sectoral analytical group, coordinates the
work of different authorities and organisations involved in the crisis management, and ensures
fast, reliable and secure flow of information and management support at the strategic level.
Already a couple of years ago, an independent communication and information network was
established within the NCMC for the purpose of the implementation of all the required
communication and information links. The network connects the most important state
authorities, government offices and companies of special importance for defence as well as
defence administrations. The application for communication in crisis situations was upgraded in
accordance with changes of regulations in the field of crisis management and defence planning.
The updating and upgrading of the network continued. The network enables a more reliable and
faster transfer of data and information between the above-mentioned entities (the transition from
the ISDN to IP technology). The network's server infrastructure was also updated.

The MoD continued to carry out tasks in the field of protection of critical infrastructure in
Slovenia. On the proposal of the Inter-ministerial Group for the Coordination of Preparations for
the Protection of Critical Infrastructure, the management of which is the responsibility of the
MoD, the Government adopted a resolution which specifies the critical infrastructure of national
significance and the responsible entities. These entities became responsible for the
development of measures for the protection of Slovenia's critical infrastructure, whereas the
Inter-ministerial Coordination Group became responsible for preparing normative legal act
which will regulate the protection of that infrastructure. The MoD prepared the methodology for
the development of measures for the protection of critical infrastructure of national importance.
Due to changes in personnel in some ministries and in the Bank of Slovenia, the Government
also adopted a resolution on changes in the composition of the Inter-ministerial Group for the
Coordination of Preparations for the Protection of Critical Infrastructure in the RS.

In the field of protection of the European critical infrastructure, the participation in meetings,
workshops and presentations organized by the European Commission and the response to its
suggestions and proposals were insured. An agreement was reached with the neighbouring EU
members to resume the activities in the process of identifying potential European critical
infrastructure. For Croatia, a new identification procedure will be carried out.

-----

The MoD prepared and harmonised the proposal for a part of the national programme for the
absorption of the European funds of the Internal Security Fund (ISF) for the areas of crisis
management and critical infrastructure protection in the EU Financial Perspective 2014–2020.

In the field of construction adaptations for the needs of defence, a regular examination and
coordination of the received applications within the MoD's organisational units and constituent
bodies were ensured. The Ministry regularly responded to documents received from the state
authorities responsible for geospatial planning in Slovenia by preparing viewpoints, proposals
and opinions.

In the field of issuing authorisations of the RS Government for carrying out air imaging for the
production of cartographic publications, the Ministry regularly prepared resolution proposals for
government consideration. In the field of issuing consents for the conduct of research relevant
to defence, regular examination and coordination of the received applications within the MOD's
organisational units and constituent bodies were ensured.

In accordance with the Plan of Exercises in the Defence System and the System of Protection
against Natural and other Disasters in the years 2013 and 2014, and in accordance with the
Rules of Exercises in the Defence System, the NATO cyber defence exercise CC14 (Cyber
Coalition 2014), NATO exercise Able Staff 14 and the EU crisis management exercise ML14
(Multi-Layer 2014) were organized and conducted. Slovenia also coordinated preparations and
participated in the conduct of international military exercises, such as Immediate Response
2014 (IR14) and the MLF exercise Clever Ferret 2014.

In accordance with the applicable NATO policy, the North Atlantic Council (NAC) prepares and
conducts regular annual Crisis Management Exercises (CMX). In addition to the key NATO
bodies, member states are also involved in the exercises, and, depending on the content of the
exercise, also the invited partner countries. In the framework of the preparations for an
individual exercise, NATO organises planning conferences, which are carried out in the Allied
countries. Experts from the member states who have professional knowledge of the areas
related to the overall contents of the exercise are also present at the conferences. Preparatory
activities for the NATO Crisis Management Exercise 14 (CMX14) took place. However, the
exercise was postponed to 2015 as the new NATO Crisis Management Exercise (CMX15).

### 3 DEVELOPMENT OF CIVILIAN CAPABILITIES 

**3.1 Civilian Functional Specialists**

In line with the tasks arising from the NATO capability targets in the field of stabilisation and
reconstruction (S&R) and in accordance with the Resolution of the Government of the RS, the
Inter-ministerial Working Group was established at the beginning of 2014. The tasks arising
from the NATO capability targets provide for the participation of the ministries in the provision of
a sufficient pool of civilian experts, which would enable member states and the Alliance to
successfully counter the modern defence and security threats or to support the Alliance's
comprehensive response to the world crises.

The MoD achieved the targets set in the field of providing civilian capabilities for participation in
IOM. One of the priorities was the strengthening of the necessary international links for a
successful continuation of operation of civilian functional specialists (CFS) performing duties
abroad and the maintenance of a qualified group of civilian functional specialists.

Invitations to tender or official calls for the identification of civilian functional specialists for
replacements in the NATO Advisory Team (NAT) in Priština, Kosovo, were concluded, namely
for the positions of a financial and budgetary advisor as well as contracts and public
procurement advisor. At the same time, an invitation to tender was published for the
identification of civilian functional specialists for a possible manning of an additional civilian
position in the NATO Advisory Team representing a key role in the establishment and provision
of an effective operation of the system of security forces within the Ministry for the Kosovo
Security Forces, namely the position of the NATO Team coordinator. The most appropriate
enrolled candidates were invited to attend the training, whereas the procedure of selecting the
candidates for the manning of positions was concluded after the completion of the training for
civilian functional specialists. The selected candidates were deployed in August and September
2014. With its civilian functional specialists, Slovenia, for the first time, manned the position
(SPECAD) POLAD in the KFOR Headquarters in Kosovo and the position of a person
responsible for liaison in the international CIMIC group (NMCG) in Italy. The deployment to
KFOR was carried out in January, and the deployment to MNCG in December. A civilian
functional specialist working in Afghanistan completed his mission in the ISAF Headquarters in
Kabul in April 2014. The Minister of Defence also adopted guidelines which stipulate that, in
accordance with possibilities and needs, a possible participation of civilian functional specialists
in the new operation Resolute Support in Afghanistan should be planned, together with the SAF
or the lead nation.

In the field of training civilian functional specialists, two courses were carried out, namely the
course on personal safety and conduct in crisis areas (in March Poljče) and the NATO CIMIC
Staff & Field Worker Course (NCSFWC – in April in Maribor). Trained civilian functional
specialists are an important technical support of every IOM. Their successful integration in the
military environment enhances the capabilities of the military component and decreases
possibilities for conflicts with civilian participants involved in a crisis.

_Training of Candidates for CFS at the International Course NCSFWC at the Kadetnica in_

_Maribor_

In May 2014, the city of Portorož hosted a NATO CIMIC Education and Training Conference
(NCETC - NATO CIMIC Education and Training Conference) within the framework of the NATO
Civil-Military Centre of Excellence (CCOE). In accordance with the realisation of capability
targets in the field of stabilization and reconstruction, MoD representatives participated at the
NATO seminar Framework Nations Concept. Two representatives of the MoD organisational
unit responsible for civil functional specialists participated as instructors at international courses
for functional specialists in MNCG.

**3.2 Cartographic and Geospatial Support to the Defence System**

In the area of mapping and geospatial affairs, for the purpose of providing mapping and
geospatial support to the SAF and the PRR activities, the MoD continued with the development
and maintenance of the mapping system coordinated with the Slovenian military and NATO
standards and the NATO geospatial policy.

In cooperation with the Surveying and Mapping Authority of the RS and the Geodetic Institute of
Slovenia, the contents of five systemic sheets of the national and military topographic map of
Slovenia with a scale of 1: 50,000 were renewed: NL 33-07-12 Sežana, NL 33-07-17 Izola, NL
33-07-18 Koper, NL 33-08-13 Ilirska Bistrica and NL 33-08-17 Karlovec. In cooperation with the
Slovenia Control, Slovenian Air Navigation Services, Ltd., and having regard to the NATO and
ICAO standards, a uniform visual flight rules (VFR) civil-military aircraft navigation map of
Slovenia with a scale of 1: 250,000 was produced. A military topographic hiking map Julian
Alps–East with a scale of 1: 25,000 was also produced. The map is very detailed and equipped
with an additional topic for the needs of the SAF in the performance of training tasks in the
mountains as well as participation in the performance of PRR tasks. In addition, a new
Catalogue of the MoD Cartographic Material 2014 was produced (in Slovenian and English) and
distributed to all the countries with which Slovenia has concluded an agreement on cooperation
in the geospatial field.

A new Memorandum of Understanding between the Government of the Republic of Slovenia
and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland on
Cooperation of the RS MoD and the UK MoD in the Field of Geospatial Information was signed.
The Memorandum provides for a free acquisition and exchange of geospatial data and maps
needed by the MoD and the SAF for work and training, and especially for the deployment of

57/102


-----

members to IOM and other tasks abroad. From 2014, it is also possible to acquire or exchange
naval charts and other materials related to maritime navigation. The conclusion of the
Memorandum enabled the participation in the technical and development cooperation in the
preparation of charts and in possible joint projects.

For the purposes of the preparation of SAF members for exercises and IOM, the prescribed
cartographic material was acquired free of charge based on the agreements concluded in the
geospatial field.

NATO documents, directives, policies and standards were studied, which is very important in
terms of interoperability of geospatial data and products between the Alliance nations. Slovenia
also participated at the meeting of the NATO Geospatial Board (NGB), which is a meeting of the
leading experts from the geospatial field in the NATO/PfP MoDs. At the meeting, key decisions
and development policies in the geospatial field are adopted.

In addition, the MoD continued with the procedures for adopting NATO Standards (STANAGs)
in the geospatial field for inclusion in the Slovenian Military Standards, in accordance with
NATO's guidance and recommendations.

### 4 INTELLIGENCE AND SECURITY OPERATIONS

The MoD intelligence and security operations were carried out in line with the Defence Act and
with the adopted annual work programme, objectives and tasks. The key tasks and objectives
were linked to the provision of adequate intelligence and security support to the SAF forces in
Slovenia and abroad (in IOM) as well as to other bodies of the national security system.

The priority task in the intelligence area in the period concerned was to assess military as well
as political and security conditions in the area of the Western Balkans, especially in Kosovo and
its neighbourhood, Bosnia and Herzegovina and in the area of Syria and Lebanon. Intelligence
and security operations were also focused on other crisis areas in Afghanistan and Africa (Mali,
Libya, Egypt, Somalia, Sudan, South Sudan and the Central African Republic), on the situation
in the sea area of southern and eastern Sicily (wider area of the humanitarian operation Mare
nostrum - Lampedusa), where SAF members were also involved, and on the developments
related to the increasing crisis in Ukraine. The MoD monitored above all the indicators that
might threaten the Slovenian defence interests or increase the degree of a military threat to
Slovenia.

One of the key priorities of the MoD intelligence and security operations was to provide efficient
intelligence, counter-intelligence and security support to the SAF members participating in IOM.
The Intelligence and Security Service cooperated with all the competent defence system entities
within the Slovenian national security system, as well as with partner intelligence and security
services and with NATO and the EU.

In the international field, cooperation continued within NATO, EU and with partner countries.
The Intelligence and Security Service continued the operation in the framework of both National
Intelligence Cells in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo as well as of intelligence and security
services of international operations headquarters. It also participated in various international
events related to intelligence and security.

In the period concerned, the implementation of processes of establishing an integrated
intelligence and security system continued, in accordance with the adopted strategic documents
and on the basis of the adopted internal MoD rules.

The focus of security-related tasks in the Intelligence and Security Service was on detecting,
investigating and preventing the security threats to persons, work posts, facilities and areas of
special importance for the defence in Slovenia and abroad.

The Intelligence and Security Service also performed the tasks of detecting and preventing the
activities of intelligence services of military organisations and other bodies and organisations
which pose a threat to the defence interests of Slovenia, the SAF or the MoD.

### 5 EQUIPPING, REAL ESTATE MANAGEMENT, STANDARDIZATION AND CODIFICATION

**5.1 Equipping**

In 2014, the implementation of the equipping projects was focused on providing the most urgent
equipment to perform regular activities and to ensure permanent readiness of the SAF in
carrying out their statutory tasks and for the operation and fulfilment of the objectives of the
Alliance. The projects Upgrading of the Cougar Transport Helicopters, the Cerklje ob Krki
Airfield, Forward Air Control, Unmanned Aircraft, EOD Capabilities, Command and Control 2
CIS Capabilities, Noise Reduction Headsets, MoD Car Park and NATO Air Command and
Control System (ACCS) are being actively implemented in the sense of the preparation of
investment documentation and management of procurement procedures, whereas some
projects are gradually entering the phase of contract execution. In line with the prescribed
dynamics, the investment documentation was prepared for those projects for which funds are
provided. For other projects, the investment documentation is prepared for the purpose of
detailed planning of resources and capabilities in the medium-term planning documents.

Due to the reduction in funding, no project was implemented within the framework of the Act on
the Implementation of Basic Development Programmes of the SAF in the period between 2008
and 2015, which formed the basis for the systematic and continuous provision of key
capabilities in the long-term development of the SAF. In 2014, inter alia, tactical vests and the
related equipment, as well as items belonging to the combat and service uniform were
purchased, and several contracts were concluded for the supply of ammunition. In order to
attain the capabilities at the Cerklje ob Krki Airfield, a contract was concluded for the purchase
of two used fire rescue vehicles. For the Protection, Rescue and Relief (PRR) system, inter alia,
thermal cameras, accommodation containers and modular unit in Sežana were purchased.

**5.2 Real Estate Management**

_Construction_
Works for the completion of reconstruction and extension of the runway and bypass road
Drnovo–Črešnjice at the Cerklje ob Krki Airfield were completed, except in the part (five percent
of contractual obligation) where the RS ownership of the land parcel has not yet been ensured.
The construction of the dangerous cargo platform, warehouses and storage platform, EXO
warehouses, transport aircraft platforms and connecting road is completed. In the Škrilj Military
Post and in the Stari vrh facility, the connection to the public water supply system was carried
out. A security fence was set up around the area of the Kadetnica in the Genelal Maister Military
Post in Maribor and for the area of the technical warehouse Borovnica. The roofs of the
following facilities were renovated: accommodation facility at the Franc Rozman Stane Military
Post in Celje, kitchen, snack bar and storage room at the Vipava Military Post, and boiler room
in Poljče. Two vertical toilet structures of the accommodation facility at the Vincent Repnik
Military Post in Slovenska Bistrica and the Edvard Peperko Military Post in Ljubljana were also
renovated. Medium voltage blocks of the transformer stations at the Ivan Cankar Military Post in
Vrhnika, Ljubljanski vrh and Škrilj were replaced, and the Šentviška gora power line, which was
damaged by ice, was repaired. Multi-annual contracts for the purposes of maintenance as well
as major maintenance works on facilities and installed infrastructure of the administrative part of
the MoD and SAF were concluded.

_Projects_
Expert ground works were prepared for the call for tender for the reconstruction of the training
facility roof at the Škrilj firing range and training area. The project documentation was prepared
for the following works: the demolition of five buildings at the Andrej Čehovin Military Post in
Postojna; removal of telecommunications facilities and the construction of platforms in Zavinek
and Žikarice; provision of power generator supply at Pečna reber; electrification of the camp
premises in the BAČ Military Post in Postojna; measurement of temperature and humidity in the
Mačkovec warehouse; rehabilitation of the boiler room of the Military Medical Unit at Štula in
Ljubljana. The following projects were prepared: renovation of the kitchen in the General

60/102


-----

Maister Military Post in Maribor; renovation of the facade and roof of the Smelt 2 building;
development of the detailed design documentation for the registration facility in Roje; and
obtaining a building permit to carry out the construction, finishing and installation works on the
building no. 29 for the storage of weapons at the Ivan Cankar Military Post in Vrhnika.

_Apartments_
The renovation of apartments due to wear-out requires considerable financial resources; funds
acquired through rents alone are not sufficient for the renewal. Regular maintenance works are
carried out in the apartments. 16 apartments underwent comprehensive renewal. A total of 492
contracts were concluded for the supply of energy products. Due to failure to pay the rent, 49
applications for enforcement were submitted, with the total value of EUR 54,483. 15 procedures
for the termination of tenancy agreements and forced eviction were completed.

_Purchase of Land_
The project of the purchase of the first phase of land for the Cerklje ob Krki Airfield will be
completed with the acquisition of the last parcel owned by four co-owners, namely when the
inheritance procedure is completed.

_Sleet_
For the performance of the logging works for the purposes of rehabilitation after the sleet
damage, EUR 168,000 were invested and 8,938 m[3] of wood was felled. Wood in the total value
of EUR 331,180 was sold.

_Registration in the Land Register_
Of the 1,111 apartments managed and used by the MoD, 216 apartments have not yet been
registered in the Land Register, which means that 80.5 percent of apartments have already
been registered in the Land Register. Of the total of 297 apartments which are still in the
process of being transferred to the RS Housing Fund or to municipalities, 85 apartments have
not yet been registered in the Land Register. In 2014, 114 apartments managed by the MoD
were registered. Of the total of 5952 land parcels, 131 parcels have not yet been registered in
the Land Register, and 13 proposals for the registration in the Land Register have been
submitted. 2.25 percent of parcels have not yet been registered.

_Telecommunication Facilities_
For the telecommunication facilities, eight tenancy agreements were concluded, as well as three
annexes to the agreement and seven agreements on the settlement of arrears.

**5.3 Standardisation and Codification**

In 2014, the MoD standardisation plan, which includes the adoption and implementation of
Slovenian Military Standards, as well as the certification of NATO standards, was not
implemented in accordance with expectations. A total of 29 Slovenian Military Standards were
adopted, resulting in 45-percent realisation of the MoD standardisation plan. 33 decisions and
orders were issued for the implementation of Slovenian Military Standards. In the process of
national certification of NATO STANAGs and STANRECs, 49 national responses were signed.

In the framework of its national competence, the National Codification Bureau of Slovenia
allocated 97 new NATO codification numbers (NSNs) to Slovenian products and registered 15
Slovenian companies, which makes 199 altogether. On the basis of the acquisition of new
supply resources, Slovenia was registered as the user of 85 NSNs. 1,504 identifications of
material resources were carried out in the SKEV environment. Data for identification was fully
prepared in the SAP and e-ZAHMAT software environment, which ensures quality data for the
use in logistics processes.

In the field of Government quality assurance, all claims by the NATO members (Turkey,
Germany, and Spain) which purchased products from Slovenian producers (AREX,
COMTRADE) were considered. The certification of the AREX Company according to the
Slovenian Military Standard AQAP 2110 was also carried out.

### 6 COMMUNICATION AND INFORMATION SYSTEM (CIS) 

**6.1 Information Security**

Key operational activities were focused on the maintenance of systems and devices for the
provision of information security in the MoD communication and information system (CIS) and in
the communication and information subsystem which provides interoperability within the
Alliance.

The MoD was responsible for the NATO Cyber Coalition 2014 exercise in Slovenia, which was
very well evaluated.

The purpose of the exercise was the training of technical and operational procedures for cyber
defence, cooperation between the training audience and making decisions to minimize the
consequences of cyber-attack in Slovenia and in the framework of the Alliance.

**6.2 Information Infrastructure**

Due to the lack of funding, the infrastructure for the System Centre Service Manager (SCSM),
and the System Centre Configuration Manager (SCCM) was not built in its entirety.
Nevertheless, the basic functionality of the system is insured and the system is operational. The
purpose of key operational activities was to provide the same level of availability of MoD CIS.
Due to the lack of funds and the reduction of staff, it is difficult to provide such level of
availability. In addition to ensuring the smooth operation of the MoD CIS, the upgrade of the
NATO network was also carried out.

**6.3 Communication Infrastructure**

In order to maintain the current level of availability of the MoD CIS and to reduce the operating
costs, telecommunication connections at 16 locations were replaced and upgraded with IP VPN
connections, and the IP telephony was introduced at two locations in Brussels and at four
locations in Slovenia.

Due to the spread of the availability of MoD/SAF CIS, the optical backbone network was
established at four locations of the MoD and the SAF, and radio relay communications system
was upgraded with four connections.

In order to provide communication support to the international military exercises Adriatic Strike
2014, Clever Ferret 2014 and Immediate Response 2014, temporary computer networks and IP
telephony were set up.

**6.4 IT Solutions**

Priority was given to the provision of high availability of information solutions which had already
been introduced into operational use (information system for paperless operations – IRDG,
register of material – SKEV, information system for defence and protection duties – ISOZD,
unified accounting, finance, personnel and labour costs – MFERAC, the public procurement
information system and a large number of specific applications – ISOJAN).

Numerous upgrades were successfully performed for the information system for paperless
operations (IRDG; for example, the sending of financial documents to the Intelligence and
Security Service and ACPDR for endorsement and signature, module for destroying documents
with a two-year retention period, renewed module for classified data, added module for reports
to the organisational units and many minor corrections).

In the register of material (SKEV), incomplete sets of equipment were joint into complete sets,
IT solution for ammunition and mine explosive ordnance was upgraded, and the connection of
the modules »Technical Cardboard« and »Certificates« was established.

-----

For the information system for defence and protection duties (ISOZD), structural changes were
made in the central population register and the register of persons subject to payment of
contributions, systemic analysis of changes in the motor vehicles register was performed,
integration with the software product Birpis in the Military Medical Service was carried out,
additional protection of access to personal data was introduced, and the creation of audit trail
during the visit of the Information Commissioner was ensured.

For the IS MFERAC, many upgrades were performed as a result of the amended legal bases or
extension of functionality. Major upgrades were performed in the field of e-commerce and
increased integration, both in the area of human resources and in the area of financial
accounting. For the public procurement information system (ISOJAN), functionalities of the
umbrella (framework) agreements were introduced, technical and substantial renewal of the
module for order proposals were carried out, and the SPON module (web portal of defence
procurement) was developed. In order to improve the efficiency of work, the connection was
established via the web service between the applications GSM (distribution of mobile phones)
and IRDG.

New SCSM functionalities and tools for the management of requirements and IT incidents were
introduced. The appropriate IT infrastructure was therefore introduced, along with the end user
software and the training.

**6.5 Development of C4I Systems**

Activities in the field of development of C4I systems were focused on the preparation of
investment documentation for the project »Command and Control 2 CIS« to support the
command and control and later on to develop documentation for the award of the contract. In
the field of realization of the capability targets, the MoD participated in the preparation of
development concepts for deployable and static networks. The MoD also participated at the
international exercise CE14. It was closely involved with the units of the 1[st] and the 72[nd]
Brigade, and offered professional assistance in developing the requirements and procedures for
testing interoperability of the C4I systems (UMO (BATOP), Comms Fix2 (Thales-Tadiran), BFT,
BMS, HQ SW, BRN testing and programming (PRC 150/400W). The training of the C4I system
users on TC (BMS, BFT, IS PINK) from other units (Military Schools Centre, 20[th] Infantry
Regiment, 74[th] Infantry Regiment, 670[th] Infantry Regiment) was successfully completed. Due to
the lack of staff, the field of C4I systems development is questionable.

### 7 INSPECTION AND INTERNAL AUDIT ACTIVITIES IN THE FIELD OF DEFENCE 

**7.1 Inspections in the Area of Defence**

In line with regulations, the Defence Inspectorate of the Republic of Slovenia (DIRS), as an
MoD body, performs inspections of the implementation of laws and other regulations as well as
of command and control acts in the area of defence. It reviews, identifies and evaluates above
all the preparedness and performance of military commands, units and institutes, status of
defence preparations, military education and training, and resolution of administrative and
technical issues in the area of defence.

In line with the statutory provisions, the DIRS also performs inspections of the implementation of
the regulations on the handling of classified information at the MoD and the entire area of
defence. It also inspects the MoD organisational units in the implementation of their
administrative and technical tasks, with the exception of the tasks and activities of the ACPDR
and the IRSPANOD.

Inspectors conduct procedures and decide on the violations in accordance with the Minor
Offences Act.

Key objectives of the DIRS for 2014 were specified in the DIRS annual work plan:

  - Provision of effective and impartial inspection of the enforcement of regulations in the
area of defence through thematic and comprehensive inspections and through
monitoring of the realisation of the measures ordered in inspection reports.

  - Provision of objective information to the MoD leadership about the observed state of the
implementation of regulations in the area of defence.

  - Preparation of action proposals for MoD leadership for the elimination of system
deficiencies.

  - Constant modernisation of inspections in the area of defence and the promotion of good
practice.

  - Performance of tasks of a minor offence authority.

  - Achievement of a higher quality of inspections through the training of inspectors, and
systematic care for the integrity of the DIRS and inspectors.

To achieve the above objectives, the chief inspector directed special attention to the planning
and coordination of the work of the Inspectorate. Based on the DIRS Work Plan for 2014, the
coordination of work was conducted through monthly and weekly DIRS Work Plans.

In 2014, the DIRS carried out a total of 56 inspections, of which 48 were regular, seven were
special announced inspections, and one was a repeated inspection. Inspectors conducted these
inspections over a period of 337 inspection days. Based on the findings, a total of 140
inspection measures were issued, of which 136 were related to the elimination of the
established deficiencies or non-compliance with regulations, two were on the termination of
activities which could pose a threat to people and property, and two were on determining the
responsibility of individuals for non-compliance with regulations. One warning in accordance
with the Inspection Act was also issued.

Of all the 140 inspection measures imposed, 137 have the force of res judicata. A complaint
was lodged against eight measures imposed. Three inspection measures were cancelled based
on a decision adopted at the second instance. The decision on a complaint at the second
instance is not within the competence of the DIRS. However, it has an impact on the execution
of inspection measures.

In accordance with the imposed inspection measures, inspectors regularly monitored their
implementation based on the analysis of the notifications on the implementation received by the
inspected entities and, if necessary, performed repeated inspections or introduced minor
offence proceedings.

64/102


-----

The DIRS provided the Minister and the Secretary of State with up-to-date information on the
findings of inspections.

**7.2 Internal Auditing**

The internal audit service attained a 45% realisation of the annual audit and counselling plan. It
carried out two regular audits encompassing the survey of the operation of internal controls and
the correctness of procedures for the allocation and use of commercial payment cards and
public procurements of lower value. Another audit is still under way and will be completed at the
beginning of 2015 Counselling was also performed in the field of inventory, and the
implementation of recommendations to the auditees for the improvement of operation was
regularly monitored.

The internal audit service issued eight recommendations for the improvement of operation in the
audited areas. Higher level of successful control over the MoD development and operation
resulted in the improved management of risks and in the functioning of internal control systems,
greater accuracy and/or clearer purpose of the MoD operation.

### 8 INVESTIGATIONS OF AIRCRAFT ACCIDENTS AND MILITARY AIRCRAFT INCIDENTS

Based on the findings of investigations of aircraft accidents and incidents, the issuing of safety
recommendations to reduce or prevent new threats and risks to military air traffic represents the
implementation of new measures. The investigation of accidents and incidents does not include
the determination of responsibility of those involved in an accident or incident.

Timely implementation of security measures affects the elimination or reduction of the possibility
of the loss of human lives and material damage to military equipment and facilities on the
ground. A serious aircraft incident is treated as if the accident has actually happened and is
being investigated in the scope of the investigation of an aviation accident.

In 2014, a total of 39 aircraft incidents were reported, 12 investigations were performed, and a
total of 34 safety recommendations were issued, which contributed to the increase of flight
safety and to the fact that in 2014, there were no accidents with military aircraft. On the basis of
the MoD order, the Service for the Investigation of Aircraft Accidents and Military Aircraft
Incidents (SIAAMAI) participated in the investigation of the hot air balloon accident, which
resulted in six death casualties and 19 serious injuries and is the largest aircraft accident in
Slovenia by this time.

Up until now, the SIAAMAI issued a total of 117 safety recommendations, which are in various
stages of implementation.

Individual findings of investigations and the issued safety recommendations were presented to
the inspection bodies, the military aviation body at the SAF General Staff responsible for the
control of flight safety of military aircraft, civilian aviation investigation body, and the RS Agency
for Civil Aviation, as well as members of the NATO organisation AFFSC. This enables the
above-mentioned institutions to be informed about the findings of investigations. In their
professional controls, they can determine the compliance with safety recommendations. With
the timely implementation of measures, they can improve flight safety and legality of flight
operations in Slovenia and IOM.

66/102


-----

The equipping of investigators with personal protective equipment was carried out to a limited
extent, whereas the equipping of the remaining members of the investigating authority was not
carried out due to the lack of funding.

The SIAAMAI is involved in the projects of installation of CVFDRs (black boxes) in the SAF
aircraft and test the proper functioning of such devices on aircraft that have them already
installed.

The accreditation of the investigation laboratory according to ISO 9001/MAA EASA part 145
standards takes place in cooperation with the Standardisation Department, the Military Aviation
Body/General Staff of the SAF and the 153[rd] Aircraft Maintenance Squadron.

### 9 STRATEGIC COMMUNICATION 

The MoD strived to maintain an open dialogue with various publics, and successfully used all
modern communication channels which determine the modern trends in communication. In
communication activities, a lot of attention was paid to the promotion of regular MoD tasks, in
order to achieve greater public understanding of the importance of their smooth performance to
ensure the security of citizens.

Special attention was paid to the informing of the public about the activities in the field of
protection, rescue and relief in the event of natural and other disasters that affected Slovenia,
and about the importance of effective coordination of work between competent ministries in the
mitigation and prevention of their consequences. Emphasis was given to the importance of
bilateral and regional contacts between countries, which was confirmed by the international
assistance during the sleet disaster that affected the entire Slovenia. The appeal to the public
for collecting humanitarian assistance during disastrous floods in Bosnia and Herzegovina and
Serbia in May 2014 was very successful and well-recognised. The assistance was transported
to the affected areas by SAF members with several tens of vehicles. The impact of the
successful work of the Slovenian Civil Protection teams and the SAF helicopter unit during the
rescue of the affected people was long felt among the public also outside Slovenia. The
participation of the SAF with the multipurpose military boat in the military humanitarian operation
Mare nostrum – Lampedusa also received a lot of attention in the media and was positively
accepted by the public.

Several media events, round tables and consultations were organised on the tenth anniversary
of joining NATO. Their aim was the discussion on the experiences and challenges of the
membership in the Alliance, and they were attended by representatives of the MoD. Among the
important anniversaries that were commemorated in 2014 were the 20[th] anniversary of
operation of the system of protection against natural and other disasters, and the100[th]
anniversary of the beginning of World War I.

The main topics of journalistic questions were the spending of financial resources, introduction
of the Falcon aircraft in operational use, purchase of military equipment (helmets) and
implementation of the National Spatial Plan of the Central Firing Range and Training Area
(OSVAD) Poček. Media attention was also paid to the management of the MoD housing fund,
and the MoD proactively communicated the decisions adopted by the RS Government on the
free transfer of the real estate which was unusable for the MoD and SAF to the local
community. There was a lot of expected public interest for the rehabilitation of explosive and
dangerous substances from the area of the chemical industry company KIK Kamnik, which was
successfully performed by the SAF experts, in cooperation with the Ministry of the Interior. The
Strategic Communication Service, in cooperation with other technical services, organisational
units and constituent bodies of the MoD prepared a total of 164 responses to journalists'
questions.

Participation of the SAF and civilian functional specialists in international operations and
missions remains a very interesting topic for various publics abroad. Various publics were
mainly interested in the end of the SAF participation in the ISAF operation in Afghanistan, and
the decision of the RS Government to continue participation in the NATO advisory mission
Resolute Support.

In communicating with the publics, the MoD also emphasized the importance of civil-military
cooperation and the multifunctional use of capabilities. A lot of media attention was paid to the
handing over of the mobile military hospital ROLE 2 LM for the needs of the Jesenice General
Hospital during the construction of the Emergency Unit, and to the temporary handing over of a
part of equipment to the Celje General Hospital. The adoption of the rules on airworthiness and
flight operations of state aircraft was of great importance for the smooth performance of the
duties of the emergency helicopter medical assistance and continues to enable an unhindered
use of the SAF and the Police helicopters for this purpose.

**9.1 Review of Website Posts in 2014**

In 2014, an average of 1.6 press releases a day were published on the MoD and SAF websites
(mo.gov.si and _www.slovenskavojska.si), or the total of 586 releases. The releases were_
equipped with more than 3,000 photographs and 179 sound recordings, which is equal to the
average of the recent years.

In comparison with the previous year, there was a significant reduction in the activity on social
networks, since the number of posts on MoD Twitter and Facebook dropped by almost half,
which may be due to the increased targeting of already established communication via the
social networks. In 2014, several new topic areas on the protection of critical infrastructure and
the work of civilian functional specialists were published on the MoD website. In cooperation
with the IT and Communications Service, the MoD organised three training events on the
maintenance of the internal MoD websites, which will allow the MoD organisational units a
continued independent publishing of information from their areas of work on the Intranet.

On the website _[www.postanivojak.si, the MoD regularly published current news on the](http://www.postanivojak.si/)_
employment in the SAF, voluntary military service and contract military service in the reserve
SAF component, as well as interesting articles about life and work in the SAF units. During six
years of operation, a total of 699,446 visits were identified, with more than 380,000 different
visitors which opened 4,017,054 pages. On average, the visitors viewed 5.7 pages and stayed
on a single page for an enviable 4.5 minutes. Appearance on social networks is a reality of
online communication, which is why the MoD expanded our activity on the social networks
Facebook, where it already has 5,000 followers, and YouTube, where it published more than
200 films viewed by more than 230,000 different visitors.

**9.2 Filming and Publishing Activities**

The realization of the plan for publishing professional military and other literature for 2014 was
higher than in previous years (18.5 percent in 2013, and 69 percent in 2014), mainly due to
more realistic planning in relation to financial and human capacities and not because of the
increased number of issued publications. In 2014, 22 publications (printed and on electronic
mediums) were issued, including periodicals, namely 12 issues of the »Slovenska vojska«
magazine, four issues of the »Sodobni vojaški izzivi« publication and the »Ujma« magazine. The
renewed Rules on the Filming and Publishing Activities were also submitted for inter-ministerial
coordination. In addition to professional military and other literature, a great number of official
texts were also proofread for the purposes of the General Staff of the SAF. In accordance with
the guidelines of the inspection, several internal training events were carried out.

A number of important projects were successfully completed in the field of video production.
The entire activities and equipment from the former Poljče Defence Training Centre were
moved to the MoD seat in Ljubljana. The presentational film Officer Candidate School and
educational film The ROLAND Air Defence System were completed, and the contents of the
educational film Tactical Procedures of the Signals Platoon were modified. Moreover, the twoyear project of presentational film The Civil Protection and Disaster Relief Training Centre in Ig
was completed. All the major important events and exercises of the SAF were documented, and
70 short videos were published on the MoD YouTube channel. These videos were also
available to media companies for the preparation of information material. The videos on the
consequences of sleet and floods which affected Slovenia and are interesting both for the
general and professional public received the highest number of views.

**10.1 Explanation of the Adoption Procedure and of the Content of Normative Changes in**
**the Field of Defence and Protection against Natural and other Disasters**

In accordance with the RS Government Work Programme for 2014 the adoption of 17
implementing regulations governing the work of the MoD (seven under the competence of the
RS Government and 10 under the competence of the MoD) was planned. 12 implementing
regulations were adopted and published in the Official Gazette. In this period, the MoD prepared
10 implementing regulations which, however, were not included in the RS Government Work
Programme for 2014, as the need for their adoption only arose in the course of the year.
Concerning the RS Government Work Programme, only 15 implementing regulations had not
yet been implemented. However, this did not have a negative impact on legal regulation of the
areas that are governed by them. Since the majority of them will be implemented in 2015,
special measures are not necessary.

Many normative activities were focused on further harmonisation of the implementing
regulations with previous regulatory changes, in the working area of the MoD and also in other
ministerial areas. Some changes were also related to the introduction of the European Legal
Order into the legal order of Slovenia.

With the Decree Amending the Decree on Voluntary Military Service, cash benefits of soldiers
performing voluntary military service were reduced by 35 percent, so that a soldier performing
voluntary service will receive around EUR 1,100 net (until the entry into force of amendments to
this decree, soldiers performing voluntary service received approximately EUR 1,700 net). With
the new Decree on Fire Protection in Natural Environment, some terms were redefined (natural
environment, open fire, incineration, arson); and fire protection measure as well as observation
and notification measure (such fire-fighting duty service) during declared high or very high fire
hazard were specified. The Rules Amending the Rules on the Uniforms of the Civil Protection
Service of the RS redefined individual characteristics of the Civil Protection uniforms (vest and
pullover) and specified the possibility of using this uniform in various combinations, depending
on weather conditions and the authorization of the competent commander. The Rules
Amending the Rules on the Special Exams of Professional Firemen specified the amended
special exam programme for professional fire-fighters and introduced the possibility of
recognizing the special exam contents also for the final exam. With the Decree Amending the
Decree on the Provision of Services in the Civil Protection Service, the wages of professional
fire-fighters were bound to the Collective Bargaining Agreement and the introductory and basic
training system was supplemented. In terms of contents, the Rules on the Licences, Powers,
Training and Exams of the Operational Staff Responsible for the SAF Air Surveillance, Air
Space Control and Air Defence regulated in more detail the requirements, modalities and
procedures related to the commencement and the course of training, and the procedure for the
issuing of licences to the operational staff responsible for the SAF air surveillance, air space
control and air defence. The Decree Amending the Decree on Salaries and other Remuneration
of Service Members of the Slovenian Armed Forces Fulfilling Obligations Assumed in
International Organisations or through International Agreements extended the validity of
reduced nominal bases for the determination of salary received for performing military service
abroad until 31 December 2015 (previously until 31 December 2014). The new Rules on Military
Personnel Assessment will ensure greater transparency of the assessment and increase
integration of military personnel assessment into the system of career management. Key
changes with regard to the previous rules are: the reduction in the number of elements to be
assessed; consideration of the importance of individual competencies in relation to the actual
formation duty; change in the approach to the assessment of individual competencies; inclusion
of a part containing data relevant to career planning into the assessment form.

### 11 COOPERATION WITH CIVIL SOCIETY ORGANISATIONS 

With the Act Amending the War Veterans Act, the responsibility for the financing of societies or
associations which operate in the public interest in the area of war veterans (societies and
associations) was transferred from the Ministry of Labour, Family, Social Affairs and Equal
Opportunities to the MoD.

In accordance with the War Veterans Act, the MoD started to prepare the criteria for the cofinancing of activities of societies and associations immediately after the transfer of
responsibility. In this way, the proposal for the Rules on Determining the Criteria for Societies in
Demonstrating Major Achievements in the Functioning of the Societies in Order to Be Granted
the Status of a Society Operating in the Public Interest in the Field of War Veterans, as well as
the proposal for the Rules on the Criteria for Co-Financing of the Activities of Societies or
Associations of War Veterans were prepared; both documents were coordinated on two
occasions with the societies and associations which were the beneficiaries of funds in 2014.
Both Rules were adopted in January 2015.

## IMPLEMENTATION OF RESOURCE PLANS

### 1 IMPLEMENTATION OF THE FINANCIAL PLAN 

In 2014, the MoD spent EUR 339.9 million on the accomplishment of its tasks, which makes up
98.8 percent of the applicable financial plan (FP) and 99.6 percent of the supplementary FP.

**MoD Financial Plan**

The RS National Assembly issued three rulings on the available resources of the MoD. The first
ruling was made in 2012, the second ruling a year later and the last in November 2014 when
the supplementary financial plan was adopted, which resulted in the reduction of the available
resources to the MoD by EUR 38,003,403 million – 39.4 percent in investments, 22.8 percent in
current expenditures, and 4,1 percent in salaries.

The applicable financial plan of 31 December 2014 amounted to 344.070.398 EUR and
exceeds the supplementary financial plan for EUR 2.747.323. Integral funds are reduced by
EUR 322,948, while appropriations are increased by EUR 3,070,270, since their value is being
assessed during the planning.

The financial plan realisation in the amount of EUR 339,949,130 represents 3.52 percent of the
RS national budget and 0.92 percent of the GDP, which is the lowest percentage in recent
years.

In comparison to the applicable financial plan, the realisation of integral funds was 99.9 percent.
The realisation of appropriations was 78.8 percent, chiefly as a result of state property
management, for which the largest amount of unapplied funds will be transferred to the next
year. The MoD integral funds represent 95.7 percent, and the appropriations 4.3 percent of the
realised financial plan.

The difference between the applicable financial plan and the realisation is the uncommitted
EUR 4.1 million – EUR 220,246 in integral funds and EUR 3.9 million in appropriations. Of the
uncommitted appropriations, EUR 3.89 million was transferred to the 2015 fiscal year. The
remaining EUR 7,776 were registered as a surplus in the RS national budget.

In comparison to the supplementary financial plan, the realisation dropped by EUR 1.4 million,
while the spending index was at 99.6. The realisation of integral funds indicates a reduction of
EUR 543,193: EUR 579,308 increase for salaries, and EUR 235,715 reduction for current
expenditure, and EUR 886,786 reduction for investments. The realisation of appropriations was
by EUR 830,751 lower than planned.

In comparison to the 2013 financial plan realisation, the realised 2014 financial plan was by
EUR 10.8 million lower, while the index was at 96.9. In integral funds, the realization is lower by
EUR 9.7 million. In nominal terms, all the categories have a lower percentage, while in in terms
of the structure, the portion of salaries went up by 0.6 percent, current expenditure went up by
0.3 percent, and the portion of investments went down by 0.5 percent. The realisation of
appropriations was by EUR 1.1 million lower.

-----

Costs of labour in the amount of EUR 239 million represent 70.3 percent of the total MoD
expenditure. In recent years, the portion intended for salaries is growing, in particular on
account of lower investments. However, in nominal terms, staff appropriations are strongly
decreasing. Since 2010, the MoD has been reducing labour costs by not replacing departures
and by recognising allowances and reimbursements only on a very rational basis. In
comparison with the previous year, the salaries in 2014 were lower by EUR 5.3 million, while in
comparison with 2009, when they were the highest, the salaries were lower by EUR 53.1
million.

Current expenditures amount to EUR 70.9 million, which represents 20.9 percent of the total
spending. Due to the ageing of the equipment, the maintenance costs are higher; fixed
operating costs also represent a large part of expenditures.

Investment expenditure stood at EUR 15.5 million, accounting for 4.6 percent of the total MoD
expenditure. Since 2007, the investments portion has been decreasing; the sole exception was
the year 2010 due to the use of the clearing debt.

The dynamics of individual categories of the MoD expenditures in the period between 2006 and
2014 is depicted in the line chart below.

**Defence Expenditure of the RS**

The realised 2014 defence expenditure stood at EUR 366 million, accounting for 0.98 percent of
the GDP (IMAD, Spring Forecast of Economic Trends 2015). It was by EUR 4.6 million lower
than that anticipated in the supplementary budget (index was at 98.8).

In comparison to the 2013 realisation, the defence expenditure decreased by EUR 15.2 million.

Defence system resources (the financial plan of the SAF, the administrative part of the MoD and
the RS Defence Inspectorate) represented 83.2 percent of the defence expenditure. The
remaining 16.7 percent was represented by military pensions, while the resources of the Office
for the Protection of Classified Information amounted to approximately EUR 0.5 million (0.1 %).

### 2 PERSONNEL PLAN IMPLEMENTATION

**2.1 Personnel Plan Implementation in the Administrative Part of the MoD**

The Joint Personnel Plan of the RS Government specified that the permitted number of
employees in the administrative part of the MoD as of 31 December 2014 was 1158 public
employees. In accordance with the Rules on the Contents and Procedures of Preparation and
Submission of Personnel Plans, the permitted number of employees excludes (1) full-time
employment with reduced working hours to compensate for phased or disability retirement of
public employees, (2) temporary employment for the replacement of temporarily absent public
employees where salary compensation is not provided by the MoD, maternity and childcare
leave, sick leave of over 30 working days and parental leave.

Since the beginning of 2009, the administrative part of the MoD strictly adhered to guidelines of
the RS Government on the reduction of the number of employees. The table below shows that
in the period between 2008 and 2014, the permitted number of employees decreased by 201
public employees, which is 85 percent of the Personnel Plan from 2008. Since 2010, the
number of employees in the administrative part of the MoD annually decreased by more than
required by the RS Government Personnel Plan.

2013 1,170 1,161 – 9

2014 1,158 1,134 – 24

In 2014, the MoD reached the goal again, since the permitted number of employees as of 31
December 2014 did not exceed the permitted number which was specified in the Decision of the
RS Government no. 10002-12/2013/7, dated 12 September 2013. The actual number was 24
employees less than the permitted number. The reasons for the lower number of employees are
mainly some unplanned terminations of employment (voluntary retirement), closure of the Poljče
Defence Training Centre and relocation of public employees from the administrative part to the
SAF, as well as restrictive employment policy.

The table below depicts the portion of the reduction in the number of public employees by
individual budget users. The table shows that in 2014, the administrative part was reduced by
two percent, which is more than agreed within the social dialogue between the Government of
the RS and the representative public sector trade unions.

**2.2 Implementation of the Personnel Plan in the SAF**

**Active Component**

The medium-term planning documents provided for 7,328 members of the SAF active
component for 2014. With the Joint Personnel Plan of the state administration bodies for 2014,
the permitted number of the SAF active component decreased to 7,327 members. On 31
December 2014, the SAF had 7,176 employed members, which means that the Personnel Plan
realisation was 98 percent.

The reason for the failure to achieve the planned number of employed members are the
restrictions to the employment, reduced interest of candidates for employment in the SAF and a
large number of departures due to meeting the conditions for retirement. Of 7176 SAF members
on 31 December 2014, there were 1,101 officers, 1,987 NCOs, 3,071 soldiers, 243 senior
military specialists, 333 junior military specialists and 441 civilians.

82/102


-----

In 2014, 312 members left the SAF (43 officers, 50 NCOs, 171 soldiers, 27 military specialists
and 21 civilians). This is more than in 2013 (292), 2012 (265) and in 2011 (281). The Personnel
Plan was not fully realised.

The quota of the SAF Personnel Plan also includes 43 people employed at workplaces or
assigned to duties in the MoD at which military service is performed in accordance with Articles
47 and 48 of the Defence Act. These members work in the Service for Investigation of Aircraft
Accidents and Military Aircraft Incidents (4), the Protocol Service (4), the Secretariat of the
Secretary-General (7), the Defence Affairs Directorate (23) and Logistics Directorate (5).

**Total** **7,360** **7,176** **-184**

Owing to the reduction in the permitted number of the SAF employees as well as to the fact that
it is mostly solders who are leaving the armed forces and they cannot be fully replaced, the SAF
cannot achieve the target ratio between officers, non-commissioned officers and soldiers, and
the SAF age structure is deteriorating.

The strategic objective of the SAF is to achieve a structural balance between officers, noncommissioned officers and soldiers equal to the ratio 1 : 2 : 5. The target ratio, within the
framework of 7,327 members of the active component, stayed the same in 2014 as it was in
2013.

**Employment in the SAF**

In 2014, 455 candidates applied for employment in the SAF. Based on the selection
procedures, 140 candidates were employed. This means that an average of 3.25 candidates
applied for one position of a newly employed.

Despite the efforts of the competent authorities, and the considerably high level of
unemployment in Slovenia, it seems that the requirements and the complexity of the military
profession, in connection with the level of salary for soldiers, discourage potential candidates to
work in the SAF.

**Voluntary Military Service**

In 2014, 250 candidates applied for voluntary military service, while 98 candidates were
assigned for the actual military service.

Since 2004, 2,472 soldiers were assigned to voluntary military service, of which 698 also
employed in the SAF. In 2014, 34 former members of the voluntary military service were
employed in the SAF.

**Military Service in the SAF Contract Reserve**

The Mid-Term Defence Programme 2013–2018 (SOPR 2013–2018) stipulated that in this
period, the number of members of the contract reserve keeps within the framework of 1,500
members.

The SAF Personnel Plan for 2014 and 2015 stipulated that on 31 December 2014, the SAF
would have the maximum of 1,200 members.

Due to the reduction in funding, possibilities for extending the currently valid contracts with
members of the contract reserve were significantly limited. The selective extension of contracts
resulted in 4.1 percent less members of the contract reserve component than planned at the
end of 2014.

On 31 December 2014, the SAF contract reserve included 1,150 members, of whom there were
26 officers, 65 non-commissioned officers, 1,018 soldiers, 24 junior military specialists and 17
senior military specialists.

_Comparison of the Number of the Contract Reserve Component Members in the Years 2013_

_and 2014_


**Situation as of**
**Category**

**31 December 2013**


**31 December 2014**


**Situation as of**


**Difference**

**(2013–2014)**


Officers 27 26 – 1

Non-Commissioned
67 65 – 2
Officers

Soldiers 1,241 1,018 – 223

Senior Military Specialists 24 24 0

Junior Military Specialists 18 17 – 1

**Total** **1,377** **1,150** **– 227**

In 2014, contracts with members of the contract reserve component were extended selectively,
for two years, and did not include the long-service bonus. In the period concerned, 106
members signed the annex on the extension of the contractual relationship. The MoD issued
the decision on the termination of the contractual relationship for 46 members.

At the end of 2014, the register included 460 candidates who meet the formal requirements for
the conclusion of contracts on military service in the contract reserve component. This is 64.8
percent less than in 2013 and is the result of the conclusion of applications depending on the
needs of the SAF for members of the contract reserve component, the age of candidates and
the time of submitting the application, as well as the fact that in 2014, the conclusion of new
contracts was not possible. Only 74 candidates submitted the application for inclusion in the
contract reserve component, which is the lowest since 2002 and is primarily due to nonaccepting new members of the contract reserve component. In the long term, this can be very
alarming because it reduces the possibilities for deployment of young people to voluntary
military service.

**Promotion of Employment and Service in the SAF**

In 2014, in accordance with the provisions of the Military Service Act, 9,827 conscripts got
acquainted with their obligations and rights. Over 200 promotional events were carried out (227
acquaintance groups), at which different possibilities were presented for the employment in the
SAF, for the performance of military service in the SAF contract reserve, voluntary military
service and scholarship. The promotion of the military profession was mostly carried out on the
web page www.postanivojak.si.

**Scholarships for Work in the SAF**

In 2014, five contracts for scholarships for the SAF were concluded for the academic year
2013/2014. Call for applications for the award of five scholarships for the academic year
2014/2015 was published in June 2014.

**Preparation of Personnel for Departure from Military Service**

For the SAF members who gained the right to retirement in 2014, an information day was
organised in April, at which representatives of Defence Affairs Directorate, General Staff of the
SAF, Kapitalska družba company and the Modra zavarovalnica company presented the
formalities to be carried out at retirement, and the absorption of funds. In June, a pre-retirement
seminar was organised, at which experts on gerontology, healthy diet, addiction etc. presented
the perils and opportunities of the third life period to the participants and gave them advice on
how to make a successful transition to that new life period in the best way possible.

Soldiers who lost their employment contracts due to reaching 45 years of age were given the
right of reassignment to the appropriate posts within the MoD.

**Care of Former SAF Members**

The Intergenerational Information and Social Centres (MIDS) Ajdovščina and Slovenska Bistrica
organised 113 events which were attended by approximately 1,300 participants. The
intergenerational groups for quality ageing accepted 11 new members, so that the total number
of their members in now 220. The voluntary intergenerational association of the RS MoD for
quality ageing has approximately 140 members.

### 3 IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PLAN FOR THE ACQUISITION OF THE STATE’S PHYSICAL ASSETS

**3.1 Real estate**

The MoD realised the plan for the acquisition of real estate of the state as well as regions and
municipalities for 2014 in the following cases:

  - Based on the Exchange Contract for the Attainment of Public Benefit, no. 478-23/201127, dated 13 May 2014, the MoD acquired land with parcel nos. 1076/41, 1076/42,
1076/43, 1076/44, 1076/45 and 1076/46 of the Selo pri Bledu Cadastral Community,
namely within the military real estate Mačkovec Fire Range. New land was acquired
through the exchange of land with parcel no. 320/14 of the Želeče Cadastral
Community, which was in the management plan and was not needed by the MoD for its
activities, and through the payment of the difference in the amount of EUR 9650.

  - The MoD carried out a contractual purchase of 1/3 of the ownership of the apartment
no. 153 in the Dom na Krvavcu Guesthouse (RTC Krvavec) in the dimension of 19.13
m², for which the MoD paid EUR 6,380.

  - Due to the project of enlargement and modernization of the Cerklje ob Krki Airfield and
based on the Decree on Spatial Plan of National Importance for the Cerklje ob Krki
Airfield (Official Gazette of the RS, no. 73/2008), the land purchase and conclusion of
rehabilitation contracts for permanent loss of agricultural land from agricultural
production and due to the extension of routes from the years 2010, 2011, 2012 and
2013 continued also in 2014. In total, 97.5 percent of the owners concluded contracts
for the purchase of land in the value of EUR 2,826,000 (of which EUR 257,000 in 2013
and EUR 6,000 in 2014), which represents 99 percent of all the land necessary for the
construction of the airfield (46.5 ha). For the rehabilitation of agricultural holdings
related to permanent loss of agricultural land and the extension of routes, contracts in
the value of EUR 519,000 were concluded for 2013, whereas for 2014, contracts in the
value of EUR 15,000 were concluded. Up until now, EUR 3.4 million were allocated.
The project of the first phase of purchase of land for the airfield will be completed with
the acquisition of the parcel (0.5 ha or 1 percent) which is co-owned by four owners (2.5
percent of the owners).

In 2014, the MoD spent EUR 37,030 for the acquisition of real estate.

**3.2 Procurement**

In 2014, the MoD conducted 191 public procurement procedures, in accordance with the
provisions of the Public Procurement Act and the Public Procurement for Defence and Security
Act. On the basis of the conducted procedures, 275 contracts were concluded, with the total
value of EUR 108.388 including the VAT.

Most of the value – EUR 99.13 million – relates to the conclusion of long-time contracts (from
three to the maximum of five years). Such contracts were concluded for goods and services for
ensuring regular operation and permanent readiness of the SAF and the protection and rescue
system in carrying out their statutory tasks, providing maintenance services and supply of spare
parts for SAF aircraft and equipment, and in all other areas where the MoD needs valid
contracts for its activities. On the basis of the Government decision on joint public procurements
for 2014, carried out by the Ministry of Finance, the MoD, on the basis of concluded umbrella
agreements, concluded direct contracts for the supply of liquefied petroleum gas, purchase of
plane tickets, supply of office paper and performance of postal services.

In the field of purchasing equipment and goods for the needs of the SAF, major orders were
made for the purchase of tactical vests and the related equipment, ammunition and armaments,
combat and service uniform items, and two used fire rescue vehicles for the needs of the
Cerklje Airfield. In the field of construction, contracts were concluded for the restoration of
security fences and for the setting up of the replacement antenna tower at the Pečna Reber
peak. Several small value contracts were also concluded for investment maintenance works.

-----

In the field of protection and rescue, a major purchase was made of thermal cameras, whereas
several procedures were carried out for the purchase of the accommodation containers,
modular unit in Sežana, fire hoses and dividers and drive unit for oil containment boom.

**3.3 Take-overs**

In 2014, 329 controls of the quality of goods and services were carried out. The total value of
take-overs was EUR 10.63 million. The financial value of take-overs was 26.13 percent lower
than in 2013. However, the number of take-overs remained similar to that of the year 2013.

**3.4 Plan for the Acquisition of the State’s Physical Assets Belonging to the SAF**

EUR 3,554,847 were spent under the heading infrastructure and equipment. Of that amount,
EUR 461,417 were spent for infrastructure, EUR 2,307,377 for the main equipment and
modernisation, and EUR 786,052 for the Cerklje ob Krki Airfield, where resources were
provided to fund further construction of electronic and visual navigation and a fire-fighting
vehicle.

EUR 659,300 were allocated to the project of investment maintenance of military infrastructure.

EUR 234,506 were allocated to the adaptation of infrastructure (electrification and optics of
camp premises at the BAČ Military Post in Postojna; acquisition of project documentation,
permits and spatial plans).

EUR 226,911 were allocated to the project of establishing technical security of the SAF
facilities.

Due to the lack of funds, co-investment in the local infrastructure was not planned.

EUR 2,341,591 were allocated to the purchase of the SAF uniforms. Most of the funds were
used for the purchase of combat uniform items and warrior's personal protective equipment,
and a smaller part of funds was used for individual service uniform items. With the available
resources, it was not possible to ensure the purchase of all types of the prescribed uniform and
protective equipment in accordance with the criteria of belonging.

EUR 410,490 were allocated to the purchase of equipment for operational functioning, which
guaranteed the purchase of only the most essential equipment for operation (equipment for
environmental protection; devices for uninterrupted power supply, fire protection and safety at
work equipment, camp equipment, naval assets, CBRN protective equipment; mountaineering
equipment, medical and veterinary equipment).

EUR 241,976 were spent for investment maintenance of material resources, which is half of the
amount spent in 2013.

### 4 IMPLEMENTATION OF THE REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE PLAN FOR THE SALE OF STATE-OWNED TANGIBLE PROPERTY 

**4.1 Real estate**

The Annual Management Plan for 2014 included real estate which the MoD does not need for
its activities, regardless of whether or not they were registered in the Land Register. At the
same time, the MoD carries out intense procedures for the development and acquisition of the
appropriate documents for the registry in the Land Register, including the land allotment
procedures. A common obstacle to the purchase are also: the judicial proceedings,
denationalisation and unsettled ownership of land on which MoD facilities are situated. In spite
of the financial crisis which resulted in the decreased sale of real estate, the MoD achieved an
increased inflow from the sale of real estate, with the emphasis on the sale of apartments and
garages. Based on the Annual Tangible Property Management Plan, eight public auctions were
carried out, along with direct sale, both resulting in the sale of real estate (28 flats, 34 garages,
17 pieces of land and four facilities) in the total value of EUR 1,924,500. Three apartments,
eight garages, five pieces of land and one facility were sold through direct sale alone. In
addition, the transformer stations in Blekova vas and Velike Bloke were also sold through direct
sale.

**4.2 Movable property**

The Ordinance on the State-Owned Tangible Assets Management Plan Intended for State
Bodies, Judicial Bodies, Public Institutes, Public Agencies and Public Funds for 2014, of which
the State-Owned Movable Property Management Plan for 2014 is a constituent part, included a
Dassault Falcon 2000 EX airplane, two radar stations of the AN/TPS-70 type, infantry
ammunition sets according to calibres and ammunition sets for a 30 mm automatic mortar
according to types of ammunition. Serious interest was shown only for the purchase of two AN/
TPS-70 radar stations.

Individual movable property which was not included in the Annual Movable Property
Management Plan was sold, since the individual value of movable property did not amount to
EUR 10,000. According to the method of direct contract, the following goods were sold: 131
pieces of permanently deactivated weapons with certificates on the deactivation of weapons,
TEMARK 60 kWA generator, 12 anti-tank barriers (full reinforced concrete tetrahedron), two
passenger vehicles Renault (Clio and Megane), three caravans Adria special 3901, 14 metres
of light camouflage fabric and non-formation equipment of the SAF. The total value of the
above-mentioned sales was EUR 136,927 million. Public auctions for the sale of infantry
weapons were carried out, selling 700 pieces of infantry weapons with the total value of EUR
133,144.

In accordance with the tenancy agreement, a light reconnaissance vehicle COBRA 4x4 was
rented to the company EM.TRONIC for the period from 23 June 2014 to 23 October 2014 in the
amount of EUR 1,400 excluding VAT.

The total value of the sold movable property and the rented vehicle amounted to EUR 271,471.

**4.3 Donations – Free Transfers**

Movable property was transferred free-of-charge to the following organisations:

  - KP-85 Rade Končar trailer kitchen to the Slovenska Istra District Association of the
Veterans of the War for Slovenia.

  - Anti-tank barrier to the Ormož District Association of the Veterans of the War for
Slovenia.

  - Four pieces of permanently deactivated infantry weapons to the Veteran Nova Gorica
District Association of the Veterans of the War for Slovenia.

  - 22 pieces of permanently deactivated infantry weapons and other material resources to
the Logatec District Association of the Veterans of the War for Slovenia.

-----

  - 10 pieces of bulletproof military helmets to the Domžale District Association of the
Veterans of the War for Slovenia.

  - 10 pieces of deactivated weapons to the Mežiška dolina District Association of the
Veterans of the War for Slovenia.

  - 18 pieces of permanently deactivated infantry weapons to the Zasavje District
Association of the Veterans of the War for Slovenia.

  - Four pieces of permanently deactivated infantry weapons to the Domžale District
Association of the Veterans of the War for Slovenia.

  - 100 pieces of combat uniform berets to the Organisation of Mountain Soldiers.

  - Two RRU-9B radio relay devices to the National Museum of Slovenia.

  - 24 pieces of permanently deactivated infantry weapons, two machine gun bases and
one hand mine carrier to the Kromberk – Nova Gorica Goriška Region Museum.

  - 22 pieces of military weapons to the Loka Region Museum in Škofja Loka.

  - 5 pieces of permanently deactivated infantry weapons to the Dolenjska Region Museum
in Novo mesto.

  - 21 pieces of permanently deactivated infantry weapons to the Zasavje Region Museum
in Trbovlje.

  - 250 l solid fuel trailer kitchen to the Voluntary Fire-Fighting Society Zagorje-mesto.

  - Quartermaster equipment (80 pieces of military blankets and 40 military beds) to the
Mountain Rescue Association of Slovenia.

  - 18 pieces of telephone cable and 7500 m of telephone wire to the Speleological
Association of Slovenia.

  - Two tents to the Slovenian Catholic Girl Guides and Boy Scouts Association.

  - Two radio devices to the Radio Club Škofja Loka.

  - 14 radio devices to the Association of Radio Amateurs of Slovenia.

Some applications of societies, self-governing local community, public institutes and individuals
were resolved negatively, as they did not fulfil the necessary legal requirements.

Based on the agreement between the old and the new managers, the MoD defined the new
manager of movable property, namely the Ministry of the Interior for the TAM 150 motor vehicle
and 6,000 pieces of rounds.

### 5 IMPLEMENTATION OF THE EDUCATION, TRAINING AND  ADVANCED TRAINING PLAN

The Education, Training and Advanced Training Plan for 2014 was implemented in the
administrative part of the MoD:

  - Functional internal training – 141 percent realisation (due to the large number of the
employees attending the classified information seminars and protection and rescue
training courses).

  - Functional external training – 37 percent realisation.

  - Language training – 51 percent realisation.

  - Training abroad – 44 percent realisation.

The above-mentioned data shows that the planning was either not coordinated with the actual
needs, or that for various reasons (too much work at the workplace, cancellation of courses,
employee turnover, and reduction of financial resources), the employees did not participate in
the planned trainings.

**Education and Training in the SAF**

Members of the SAF improved their capacity to perform tasks with their participation in various
forms of education and training within the Military Schools Centre or in comparable military
education and training courses abroad.

In 2014, the only ones who continued the part-time education were the SAF members –
participants of the module studies, which are a combination of military and undergraduate
studies for non-commissioned officers at the Vocational College of Traffic and Transport.
Currently, 12 more SAF members have valid education contracts for the acquisition of a higher
level education. In 2014, 19 SAF members who concluded contracts on education with the MoD
successfully completed the training courses for the acquisition of general higher level education.

Language courses for the acquisition of STANAG 3332 and 2221 were successfully completed
by 13 SAF members. 86 members attended the English Language False Beginner Refresher
Course. 13 members attended the English Language High Elementary Refresher Course and
1,200 candidates underwent the ALCPT placement tests.

As many as 3,575 members of the SAF, MoD, Police and of foreign armed forces participated in
different forms of military education and training in the organisational units of the Military
Schools Centre. The planned military education and training courses were completed by as
many as 3,445 candidates.

Various functional and career education and training courses abroad were attended by 227 SAF
members, out of which 129 were officers, 69 non-commissioned officers, 19 soldiers, eight
military specialists and three civilians. The realization of all the executed attendance at
education, training and advanced training courses abroad was 55 percent when compared to
the planned attendance.

There are various reasons for non-realisation of planned attendance. Some are due to the
organisers, while others were cancelled due to reduced funds.

The chart shows the trend of reductions of the funds in the last six years. In 20014, 67.6 percent
less financial resources were allocated for the education and training of individuals in the SAF
as in 2009. Input in education and training of individuals does not follow the needs resulting
from the maintenance of current and the development of new capabilities. Deployments to
functional education and training courses were carried out mainly to grant licenses and powers
that are essential so that members can perform their professional duties.

### 6 IMPLEMENTATION OF THE INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION PLAN

International activities in the MoD were carried out within programmes of bilateral and
multilateral cooperation, the EU, NATO, sports – CISM (Conseil International du Sport Militaire)
and military and technical cooperation. Activities were carried out in accordance with priorities,
programme and objective set out in the 2014 MoD Business Plan.

The objectives in the field of international cooperation supported the achievement of key
conceptual objectives and priorities of the MoD.

Based on the Annual Plan of International Cooperation for 2014, the MoD planned 1,167
events. 746 events, or 63.92 percent, were realized, and 422 planned events were not realized.
299 unplanned events were realized. The MoD spent EUR 840,785 to implement the plan of
international cooperation. The details are shown in the table below: The Summary of
Realisation in the Field of Implementing the MoD's International Cooperation Plan for 2014.

The discrepancy between the planned activities and the actual realization is still large. At the
same time, the number of new unplanned events that could not be foreseen during the time of
planning increased.

The number of realized unplanned events reminds us that the planning should also take into
account new obligations and foresee subsequent execution. In the assessment of the
realisation of planned events, it is also necessary to take into account cancellations of the
opposite side, as well as the fact that some of the proposals are written only as a form of
possible cooperation, that certain objectives aimed at with certain activity have changed, and
that there are some organisational and personnel changes.

**6.1 International Cooperation within NATO**

Activities of the MoD in 2014 were focused on the preparation of the Summit in Wales attended
by heads of state and government in September. In preparation for the NATO Summit, the
Ministers met in February and June 2014 in Brussels. In March, Slovenia hosted the meeting of
the Defence Policy Directors of the NATO member countries in Ljubljana. In Wales, the
Readiness Action Plan was adopted, extending the implementation of the assurance measures
for the Eastern Allies and strengthening NATO's readiness by enhancing the intensity of military
exercises and creating rapid deployable high-readiness forces which will be able of rapid
deployment to the East. The Allies adopted a commitment to stop the negative trend of the
declining defence spending and try to gradually rise this spending within the next ten years in
line with the economic growth.

In the framework of NATO, the SAF carried out 134 events. The main activities at which the
SAF participated were the meetings and conferences of the Military Board at the level of chiefs
of general staffs, which mainly discussed the possibilities of a joint use and sharing of forces
and means as well as the adjustments of the operation of defence systems, taking into account
the reduction of defence budgets.

SAF representatives participated in meetings of various NATO expert committees and working
bodies. In 2013, as a result of rationalization, a large part of the tasks were performed by
members of the Peacetime Structure of the SAF Abroad.

NATO began preparations for the transfer of the centre of gravity from operations to the
readiness for operation across the whole spectrum of possible sources of threats, particularly in
the implementation of the Readiness Action Plan (RAP), adopted at the summit in Wales in
September 2014. During operations, the focus was on the completion of the ISAF operation
(Afghanistan) and the preparations and creation of conditions for the mission Resolute Support.

In the area of transformation, the focus is on the implementation of the new NATO command
structure, reform of the agencies and the International Military Staff (IMS), achievement of key
capabilities within the Defence Planning Process (NDPP), Connected Forces Initiative (CFI) and
Smart Defence (SD), and the renewal of the field of training and exercises (ETEE), with the
emphasis on the NATO Response Force (NRF).

Slovenia also participated in the following important activities abroad: conferences of the NATO
Military Committee at the level of Chiefs of General Staff, strategic conference with partners and
the conference of heads of transformation in the Allied Command Transformation (ACT).

In the field of informatics and communications, the MoD participated in the work of committees
and working groups and acquired knowledge for work on the target capabilities in the field of
informatics and communications, for the maintenance and management of the NATO
cryptographic network in Slovenia, and for the event associated with the NATO exercise Cyber
Coalition 2014.

96/102


-----

The MoD was assigned the responsibility for the building of initial capabilities for the provision of
cyber security. Therefore, two unplanned events were carried out. The acquired knowledge will
contribute to the successful establishment and implementation of activities in the field of cyber
security at the MoD and in Slovenia. An important aspect of participation in education is also the
establishment of contacts with lecturers and other training participants, since one of the
prerequisites of a successful collective cyber security assurance is also mutual trust between
the cyber defence actors.

In spite of financial constraints, the MoD actively participated, within the framework of the
Organisation for Science and Technology, in three activities of the panel for human factors and
medicine, one activity within the panel for the technology of information systems, and three
activities within the panel for the technology of sensors and electronics. In addition to the MoD's
internal experts, experts from the following institutions were also involved in the work of the
groups: Jožef Stefan Institute, Psychiatric Clinic, Alpineon, Jožef Stefan International
Postgraduate School and the University of Ljubljana, Faculty of Electrical Engineering. With this
kind of cooperation, the capability targets were only partially supported due to the lack of own
resources. However, the resources within the framework of the NATO support programme were
fully utilized. According to the MoD, the cooperation, which was nevertheless carried out to a
limited extent, was successful and fruitful.

In the field of cooperation with NATO member countries, the exercise Broken Wing 2014 was
organised, including participants from the United States of America and the Republic of Croatia.
The exercise was carried out for the purpose of acquainting the exercise participants with a
possible situation which might realistically occur in the event of an aircraft accident. In this
particular case, the simulation of a collision of a SAF aircraft with an unmanned aircraft (UMA)
was carried out, since this type of aircraft is increasingly present in the airspace. At the end of
the exercise, participants made conclusions and gave proposals for improving the UMA
situation, particularly in the field of documents governing UMA flights, both in the civilian and
military fields.

**6.2 International Cooperation within the European Union**

In the field of military cooperation with the European Union, the SAF carried out 14 events.

As with the events in the framework of the Alliance, the participation at the majority of the
events was taken over by the Military Representation of the SAF to the EU due to
rationalization. The Representation carried out its mission by representing the national interests
in the EU committees and working groups within the EU Military Committee (EUMC). In terms of
contents, the activities were directed towards the December European Council meeting on the
Common Security and Defence Policy. In addition to the Council, the attention was also devoted
to the preparation and deployment of the EUTM Mali mission.

According to the IT and Communications Service, the scope of cooperation with the EU in the
field of informatics, telecommunications and cyber defence is too limited, which means that in
the international environment, Slovenia's contribution to common EU objectives is too small.

Within the framework of the Italian Presidency of the EU Council, Slovenia participated in the
field of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the EU. In Slovenia, there are no large
manufacturing and integrator companies in the defence area. Since there are no domestic
companies in Slovenia, Slovenian SMEs have to either take on the role of those companies in
the area of technologically less demanding products, such as weapons and ammunition, or
attempt to become suppliers for large foreign producers, which is much more difficult due to the
large market and supply.

In the field of R&T, Slovenia participated in the European Defence Agency (EDA). It also took
up efforts towards the accession to the joint investment programme of Remotely-Piloted Air
Systems. Slovenia is in the process of joining the programme in the part which relates to the
integration into the airspace.

The MoD participated in the Flight Safety Conference (AFFSC(E)) in Lithuania – the conference
of investigators of aircraft accidents and flight safety of military aircraft. The membership in the
AFFSC(E) enables instant notification between the members on the accidents and incidents of
military aircraft of the same type, and mutual technical assistance in the event of an aircraft
accident investigation, in accordance with STANAG 3531. Slovenia is responsible for the
organisation of the international conference in 2015.

**6.3 Bilateral Cooperation**

The annual bilateral cooperation programmes were prepared together with 26 countries on the
basis of umbrella agreements on cooperation of countries in the defence field. In accordance
with the Declaration of the National Assembly on the Western Balkans, the Guidance on the
Activities of the RS in the Western Balkans and the Action Plan on the Activities of the RS in the
Western Balkans 2014, a part of the operations planning was oriented towards the countries of
that region, in addition to the four neighbouring countries. In comparison with 2013, the SAF
notes the reduction in the number of events carried out by 26 percent (from 101 to 77), which
reduces the importance of bilateral cooperation in that region in comparison with other
countries. The reasons are mainly the restriction of funds both in Slovenia and in the
participating countries.

In addition to the USA, intensive bilateral cooperation also takes place with the strategic
partners France, Germany and Italy. The cooperation with France is focused mainly on the
expert area of the navy. With Italy, Slovenia cooperates in the IOM and the Multinational Forces
(MLF).

Among the strategic partners, in addition to the USA, intensive bilateral cooperation takes place
with France, Germany and Italy. The cooperation with France is focused mainly on the expert
area of the navy. With Italy, Slovenia cooperates in the IOM and the Multinational Forces (MLF).

At the bilateral meeting with Serbia, the MoD presented the interest of Slovenia's industry's in
cooperation with Serbian companies or the MoD. The Serbian side will examine the interest and
prepare feedback and interest of Serbian companies in cooperation. Based on that information,
Slovenia will organize bilateral meetings of relevant entities in the field of economics and
scientific research.

Slovenia continued the successful cooperation with the Austrian MoD, especially in the field of
disinvestment and material management.

**6.4 Multilateral Cooperation**

In 2014, the SAF carried out 85 multilateral events. In the field of multilateral forms of
cooperation, the most important for the SAF was the further development of the Multinational
Centre of Excellence for Mountain Warfare, which continued the procedures for transformation
into the NATO Centre of Excellence. Italy, Germany, Croatia and Austria announced to join the
Centre in 2015.

The SAF actively participated in the regional initiatives of the Western Balkans (participation in
the meetings of the Adriatic Charter, SEDM, and others), DECI (Defence Cooperation Initiative)
at the level of Chiefs of General Staffs, their deputies or Sergeants Major. Expert meetings were
carried out for the further development of the Balkan Medical Task Force (BMTF), which is
progressing towards the establishment of a regular structure. Cooperation continues at the
CBRN Defence Centre Kruševac, where the SAF contributes one member into the working
group.

The Verification Centre carried out 16 multilateral activities and thus increased the intensity of
cooperation in relation to previous years. Among other things, it carried out an activity in
Slovenia in the field of international treaties on open skies, whereas the remaining events were
related to the obligations deriving from the Vienna Document, to OSCE and other forms of
cooperation between European verification centres in the field of arms control.

At the EUROSATORY trade show, the Slovenian companies in the field of defence, security
and protection and the MoD shared a common stand where they presented themselves. The
goal set was met in line with expectations, and the result was an increased interest of foreign
ministries and companies in information and cooperation with our defence industry.

In the framework of the group of users of the Pandur vehicle, the MoD hosted members of the
Maintenance and Spare Parts Working Group (CSPL - Common Spare Parts and Logistic) in
Maribor. The meeting was attended by representatives of Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic
and Slovenia, who exchanged their experience on the use of the Pandur vehicles (Valuk),
technical problems, procurement of spare parts and possible upgrades.

**6.5 Cooperation in the Field of Military Technology**

In the field of military technology, 16 events were carried out. Due to the financial situation, the
number of events was limited to the most important ones. In this category, among others, the
following projects were carried out: the takeover of the upgraded helicopter Cougar (France),
participation at the military equipment exhibition Partner 2014 (Serbia), and the prior preparation
of the Falcon aircraft for entry into the military register (Switzerland).

**6.6 Sports – CISM**

The events of the International Military Sports Council (CISM), in total, present approximately
three percent of all SAF’s international military cooperation events. With their role, these events
greatly contribute to the integration of the armed forces and the promotion of countries in the
field of military sports, which can also be seen in other fields of the SAF's core activities.

Slovenia's national delegation to the CISM coordinated its work at seven sessions. Due to the
very limited financial resources for the CISM activity, the SAF organized only one regional CISM
competition. It was the Regional Orientation Competition, participated by military teams from
Belgium and the Netherlands. The national delegation's Secretary General attended the CISM
General Assembly (Indonesia), European CISM Conference (Estonia) and the meeting of the
CISM Neighbours Regional Group (Germany).

## IMPLEMENTATION OF THE THE RISK REGISTER

The risk register is a set of anticipated risks that could be a negative influence on the
economical use of the fiscal resources and the attainment of the MoD's set goals, and the set of
all measures that are prepared in advance and applied for preventive and timely reduction of
the negative influences of risks.

Based on the MoD’s risk register, 159 risks were anticipated for 2014. The level of risk is
determined based on the level of the risk probability estimate and the consequences influence
estimate, which are marked with numbers from 1 to 3, the higher value meaning greater
probability of the occurrence or a greater influence of consequences of the realized risk. The
product of both assessments signifies the level of risk. Taking into account the value of the
product, four levels of risk have been determined:

  - 9 – a very high probability for the occurrence of the risk and the influence of the
consequences (red colour).

  - 6 – a high probability for the occurrence of the risk and the influence of the
consequences (orange colour).

  - 3, 4 – a medium level probability for the occurrence of the risk and the influence of the
consequences (yellow colour).

  - 1, 2 – a low probability for the occurrence of the risk and the influence of the
consequences (green colour).

10 risks or 6 percent out of all risks have been assessed with the highest level of risk, 52 or 33
percent were attributed a high level of risk, 69 or 43 percent with a medium level of risk, and 28
or 18 percent with a low level of risk, as depicted in the chart below.

_Structure of Risks in Reference to the Levels of Risk_

The chart below depicts the realisation of risks in reference to individual levels of risk. With very
high and high probability for the occurrence of the risk, levels 9 and 6, the realisation was 60
and 47 percent. This means that with these risks, the assessment of the level of probability for
the occurrence was correct and that consequently, the measures in response to the occurred
risks could be prepared and implemented on time. The level of realisation of lower-level risks
(1–3) was 33 and 28 percent.

The prevailing risks with a very high probability of occurrence are of project nature and refer to
the field of spatial planning, the status of real estate in the Land Register, and untimely
implementation of infrastructure projects, which is also the result of delays in the registration of
easement in the Land Register. Risks with a very high probability of occurrence also include

those of the procedural, personnel-related and normative type. The procedural risks primarily
refer to the lack of provision or maintenance of target capabilities and the changes of the
prospects of real estate. The personnel-related risks refer to the untimely preparation and
establishment of the competency model and the lack of personnel for international military
cooperation at all levels. The normative risks refer to the lack of the legal bases regulating the
field of defence planning and crisis management.

In 2014, 68 risks or 43 percent of anticipated risks were realized, and appropriate measures
were applied for the majority of them. The measures were successfully implemented for 81
percent of all the realised risks. The result represents an improvement in comparison to the
previous year, when 79 percent of the measures for realised risks were implemented.

Successive realisation of risks in the years 2013 and 2014 means that appropriate measures
which would reduce the level of risk were not implemented. There was a 40-percent realisation
(4 out of 10) of risks of the highest level entered in the risk register for 2013 and 2014. With
high-level risks, realisation was 47 percent (19 out of 40 were realised), whereas with mediumlevel risks, it was 26 percent (18 out of 69 were realised).

101/102


-----

On the other hand, successive non-realisation of certain risks both in 2013 and 2014 means
that the risks are managed and their level of occurrence may be reduced. The non-realisation of
risks of the highest level recorded in the risk register for 2013 and 2014 was 20 percent (2 out of
10 were not realised), whereas for high-level risks, the non-realisation was 32 percent (13 out of
40 were not realised) and for the medium-level risks, it was 25 percent (17 out of 69 were not
realised).

However, there are still too many risks which the MoD has no direct influence on, because it
depends on the available funds allocated under the RS national budget. In such cases, it is
necessary to achieve the least possible impact of such risks on the achievement of key MoD
objectives.

The structure of risks in reference to their type (personnel-related, project-related, procedural,
normative, financial or security) shows that the majority of risks (43 percent) are of procedural
nature, as depicted in the chart below.

Among the risks with very high probability of occurrence (level 9), four are project-related, two
are procedural, two are personnel-related and two are normative. Among the risks with a high
probability of occurrence (level 6), 17 are of procedural type, 11 are project-related and seven
are financial.

The predominance of procedural and project-related risks is a warning that processes and
project management should be given more attention in the future, as they directly influence the
effectiveness and efficiency of operation. In a metaphorical sense, this means that our priority in
the short-term period must be to further endeavour for an effective use of the limited financial,
personnel and material resources and systematically direct them towards the implementation of
the key long- and medium-term objectives.

Effective implementation of measures for the management of risks and the prevention and
mitigation of their consequences greatly contributes to the further development of the defence
system, which is highly important in the ever more complex, changing and unpredictable
security environment.
