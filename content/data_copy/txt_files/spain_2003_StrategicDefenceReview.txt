### FOREWORD BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE GOVERNMENT


-----

It is with great satisfaction that we present before Spanish society
this Strategic Defence Review. As I stated in the White Paper 2000,
the Review was to be the fruit of a significant collective reflection
process designed to provide the Armed Forces with the necessary
military capabilities to act in the strategic scenario of this new
century.

To this end and through this Review, the Government that I lead
seeks to ensure the efficiency and effectiveness of the efforts that
Spain as a sovereign nation must make over the next 12-15 years in
order to meet its own defence needs as well as those of the security
framework we share with our partners and allies.

With this in mind, we initiated a process that has led us one
step further in the continuous evolution of our Defence. We now
present the Strategic Defence Review, which creates new structures
and mechanisms for decision-making, modifying old concepts so
as to have a modern and capable security and defence system,
adjusted to both national possibilities and the strategic
international panorama.


-----

This is also another step in the reform of our Services, which
should not be limited to the objective of creating a smaller but more
efficient Armed Forces. Rather, this reform should ensure the fulfilment
of the missions constitutionally entrusted to the Armed Forces,
reinforce our commitments with the Atlantic Alliance and better
contribute to the European security and defence instruments. In any
case, our membership in the main international security and defence
organizations is a matter of satisfaction and pride, and strengthens
Spain’s freedom of action in defending its interests as a sovereign nation.

The peace, liberty, prosperity and stability that Spain now
enjoys, the level of political, human, cultural and economic
development, the degree of pluralism in our society, the depth of
support for modern and advanced democracy, and the constitutional
protection afforded for all Spaniards in the exercise of their human
rights, are values that have not come about spontaneously. They have
been achieved through the efforts of the generations before us, and
we have the inescapable obligation to preserve and transmit them to
the next generation.

The mission of Defence is to help ensure these values and
protect our freely chosen way of life, our rights, our possessions and
our interests, wherever they lie. The best guarantee that Spanish
Security and Defence policy can offer our society is the firm
resolution to have the capability for active participation in
maintaining a more stable and secure international order, based on
peaceful coexistence, defence of Western democratic values and
interests, human rights and international law. All this must be done
while still carrying out the basic missions of deterrence, and defence
of the national territory.

In an effort to involve the entire society in designing the Armed
Forces of the 21[st] century, the Government made the political


-----

decision to encourage debate on the Strategic Defence Review, both
within the Ministry of Defence and externally. For this purpose it
was stipulated that the Review be carried out with the greatest
possible transparency and consensus, as indicated in Directive
1/2000, which initiated the whole process.

In sum, throughout the entire Strategic Defence Review process
it has been clearly demonstrated that Spanish society is fully capable
of providing ideas and valid initiatives related to security and
defence. For any policy to achieve its desired ends, there must be a
strong bond between society as a whole and political power so that
society may feel a sense of participation in the making of policies.
Such policies have citizen backing, which benefits democracy.

Therefore, this Review will be the future general frame of
reference for our Armed Forces regarding its structures and action
procedures in a changing strategic scenario, harmonising its actions
with the external action of the State, thus achieving our national
aspirations and protecting our interests wherever they lie.

I trust that the significant effort involved in our country’s first
Strategic Defence Review can satisfy the interest that has arisen in
the various national and international settings.

Jose Maria Aznar

**PREFACE**
**BY THE**
**MINISTER OF DEFENCE**


-----

As I explained at the beginning of my term as Minister of
Defence, during my first parliamentary appearance to outline my
programme for the current legislature, I planned to carry out a
reform that would encompass a long-term view of our security and
the role of the Armed Forces - a vision extending to 2015 or 2020 at
least. More specifically, I spoke of this vision in terms of a Strategic
Defence Review process, defined by the following elements:
facilitation of the joint action of the Services; a fully professionalised
Armed Forces with modern equipment and capable of contributing
both to European defence and to allied commitments; and a defence
culture characteristic of an advanced democratic society that takes
ownership of the effort and contribution required for collective
defence.

This process began with the impetus of the President. According
to Defence Directive 1/2000, signed late that year by President
Aznar, the first line of action in our Defence Policy was to begin a
Strategic Review. This Review should integrate Defence within the
broader framework of shared security with partners and allies and
determine the military capabilities needed for fulfilling the


-----

responsibilities derived from this. The priority of the Strategic
Defence Review was a fundamental reason for the creation -in
January, 2001- of the Secretariat General for Defence Policy; this
organ assumed the responsibility for the groundwork and
development of the process that has just concluded.

Prior works by other countries were examined in depth,
especially those closest to us in the geopolitical and geostrategic
environment: the United States, Belgium, Norway, Germany and
especially Great Britain. The events of September 11[th] confirmed
the transcendence and urgency of the process that was already
underway. A decision was taken to end this process of reflection
immediately after the Prague Summit, understanding that key
strategic decisions concerning the Alliance would be taken there,
which we would subsequently need to incorporate into our
Strategic Review.

Given the anomalies that have characterised our history in
security and defence matters, as well as the changes taking place in
our Armed Forces and in the contemporary strategic panorama, we
can currently state with legitimate pride that Spain’s situation in the
field of security has changed radically. Now fully integrated in the
Atlantic Alliance and a prominent member of the European Union,
we have opened up our country and our society, projecting our
democracy towards Europe and the world. Actively participating in
this new reality, our fully professional Armed Forces have a newly
established profile resulting from the historic and successful
transformation process of the last few years. Breaking with the
conscript-based model that formerly composed the Armed Forces,
we now have a professional model staffed with 75,000 volunteers
that have enabled the deployment of our Armed Forces both in
defence of our own national interests and in the framework of shared
security and collective defence of Western values.


-----

The new professional Armed Forces in new scenarios and with
new missions have made it absolutely indispensable to carry out the
Strategic Defence Review. This process was conceived as a critical
and open debate on broad security and defence questions. In order
to establish the Spanish strategic conception, we analysed its three
traditional components: security interests, risks and scenarios and
missions of the Armed Forces. Then we began a second phase to
determine the capabilities needed for the Armed Forces, regarding
both numbers and materiel.

In accord with Directive 1/2000, we sought from the very
beginning to achieve the maximum internal political, institutional
and social consensus. For this purpose we established contact with
other Departments in this Ministry, sought the cooperation of
prestigious academic institutions and organised seminars, debates
and surveys to encourage civil society’s participation in this process.

We are pleased that this Review recently received broad majority
support after its presentation to the Parliament. Its conclusions
project a vision for the Armed Forces over the next 15 years,
providing a stable and permanent frame of reference for Spain’s
defence and military policies.

The Spanish strategic conception, which includes both external
action and defence policy, represents the overall Spanish perception
of our role in the world, our positioning in the international arena,
and our vocation based on our geography, history, political reality
and future projects.

In the current globalised strategic scenario, our geopolitical
position indisputably predisposes us toward a global orientation in
the perception and subsequent protection of our interests, our
presence throughout the world, and our efforts at international
cooperation in support of peace and stability.


-----

The main beneficiary of this theoretical and practical reflective
process is Spanish society. If we have been able to achieve a notable
degree of consensus concerning a strategic document for the next 15
years, it is because Spanish society gives increasing importance to
questions related to security and defence. It is evident that our
society is beginning to express a desire to strengthen its current level
of national defence consciousness, which will determine our future
and the preservation of our system of rights and freedoms.

### INTRODUCTION

### INTRODUCTION

This document is the result of the development process of the

**“STRATEGIC DEFENCE REVIEW”, directed by the Secretariat**
General for Defence Policy. It consists of **one global structure,**
composed of two parts and several distinct Annexes.

**PART ONE, the “GENERAL OVERVIEW”, is a synthesis of**
all the aspects related to the Strategic Review, including classical
themes from the strategic planning exercises of surrounding
countries, as well as uniquely Spanish issues. These first pages, that
develop the essential elements of the Review, have been written in a
straightforward manner and without extensive analysis, in order to
make them easier to read.

The index allows a good understanding of the general content
of the Review and of its main subheadings. The first chapter
describes **“The Context of the Strategic Review”, including a**
specific examination of strategic and military innovations, changes in
present-day values, and the new reality of globalisation; all of which
affect the evolution of our country in a timeframe that extends
through the year 2015.

The second chapter is titled **“National Security Interests”. It**
briefly describes each of these interests both within and outside our
borders, while also analysing other traditional elements of strategic
conception, such as risks and theatres of action.

The third chapter is central to the entire Review, as it examines
the **“The Missions of the Armed Forces”, addressing the many**


-----

autonomous perspectives as well as our present reality of allied and
collective defence. Along with defensive tasks, the other two general
missions of the Armed Forces are also examined. The first is the need
to achieve international peace and stability. The second task, though
not entirely a military one, is still of equal importance: ensuring the
security and welfare of our citizens, in accord with the laws of our
constitutional framework.

The fourth chapter, “The Armed Forces in the 21[st] **Century”,**
relates to a series of ideas found in other parts of the Strategic Review
concerning the clear need to fully modernise our Services, formally
and functionally, structurally and operationally.

The last chapter of Part One, **“Parameters of the Review”,**
highlights elements that will be carefully developed throughout the
remainder of the Review. Several key aspects are debated: the human
factor, material and technological factors, along with other objectives
found in the Review; such as achieving greater projection, mobility
and interoperability within the context of a necessary rationalisation
of the existing Armed Forces structures.

**PART TWO might be considered the “core” of the Strategic**
Review. Presented there are 14 BASIC CRITERIA, the outcome of a
series of decisions and definitions adopted during the Review process,
and which may be considered final conclusions of the process.

Beginning with the place of the **Armed Forces within our**
constitutional framework, this document goes on to define a series of
objectives related to the Defence effort: orientation towards Force,
readiness for the most demanding action, and capability to
adequately carry out the new missions (Criteria 1, 2, 3 and 4).

Following these are three key Criteria for empowering the tasks
of **Chief of the Defence Staff** as Operational Commander of the


-----

Armed Forces, through the creation of an **Operations Command**
subordinate to him, as well as a Joint Rapid Reaction Force from
pooled Forces. As a result the Service Chiefs of Staff will constitute
the exclusive Organic Commands (Criteria 5, 6 and 7).

After **Criterion 8 concerning the** **functional structure of the**
Services, the question of human resources is examined in Criterion
**9, followed by the logistic integration of Defence in Criterion 10.**
The 11[th] **Criterion argues for maximum interoperability.**

Using basically operational terms, the last three Criteria (12, 13
**and 14) define the specific characteristics of the three main Forces:**
the Land, Naval and Air Forces.

Lastly, the eight ANNEX DOCUMENTS are in most cases directly
linked to elements already mentioned in the first and second parts.

The first three Annex Documents include in an abbreviated
fashion the conclusions from the work groups designated to analyse
the essential elements of any strategic conception. ANNEX A refers
to **“national security interests”;** **ANNEX B refers to** **“risks and**
**security and defence scenarios”; and** **ANNEX C refers to** **“the**
**missions and tasks of the Armed Forces”.**

**ANNEX D contains a detailed study of the “Capabilities of the**
**Armed Forces”. It is the result of a broad work group of military**
planning experts and describes the efforts required in the fields of
joint and Service capabilities, in order to carry out the missions
entrusted to the Armed Forces.

These issues are further detailed in ANNEX F: “Material
**Resources for Defence”. This section was written by the Secretariat**
of State for Defence and is of their direct competence. Special
emphasis was given to the first subheading: **“Armament and**


-----

**Materiel Policy”, which includes concrete statements concerning**
short, medium and long-range acquisitions policy as well as
statements regarding key areas such as logistic integration and
financing new arms systems. The other two subheadings of Annex F
deal with “Infrastructures Policy” and the “Information Systems
**and Telecommunications Policy”, which have been advanced by**
the Defence Secretariat and are essential in the process of
modernising the Armed Forces.

The Under-Secretariat for Defence was responsible for the final
draft of **ANNEX E on** **“Human Resources for Defence”. It**
describes the Armed Forces model and present situation, analysing
the various personnel processes required to develop an efficient
policy in this matter.

**ANNEX G, “Normative and Organisational Consequences”,**
was drafted - with the appropriate coordination - by the Ministry of
Defence’s “Study and Monitoring Group”. It contains the Criteria
that will inspire the reform of the Organic Law on National
**Defence and Military Organisation. It also reviews other goals**
reached during the Review process due to the approval of several
Organisational Decrees regarding the basic functional structures of
the Services and their institutional representation, along with the
**peripheral structure** of the Ministry and its **external**
**representation.**

**ANNEX H,** **“The Process behind the Strategic Defence**
**Review”, completes the list, dealing exclusively with procedural**
aspects. Recorded here are the various steps involved in fulfilling the
express mandate contained in Defence Directive 1/2000: to “seek the
maximum political, institutional and social consensus” on the
Strategic Review, which has required adherence to high standards of
transparency.

### THE CONTEXT OF THE STRATEGIC REVIEW

**1.- Changes in the Strategic Scenario**

Over the last decade few things have changed as much as the
environment and the conditions for security and defence. The
Defence White Paper 2000 clearly reflected that the changes in the
**strategic scenario during the nineties have been spectacular. The**
disappearance of the traditional enemy was a great relief in terms of
military availability in the last decade, but it has not created a new
order free from risks and threats to international stability and peace.
In the nineties numerous conflicts erupted, some new in nature,
which have torn entire nations apart through civil, religious and
ethnic conflicts.

The persistence and virulence of these conflicts, especially those
closest to Western Europe like the one in ex-Yugoslavia, strengthened
a **new collective conscience favouring intervention by the**
**International Community under the auspices of the UN, or**
through regional organisations such as NATO or coalitions formed
by some of its members. In the nineties defence went from being an
instrument dedicated to the national interest, to also becoming an
instrument of international peace.

**NATO’s New Strategic Concept, approved in April of 1999,**
explained the essence of the changes that have led our troops to be
present in different parts of the world, from the Balkans to
Afghanistan. After half a decade of Balkan interventions, it was
recognised that peace support missions were becoming one of the
basic tasks of Western armies, in contrast with the traditional


-----

**collective defence mission for which NATO had been created fifty**
years ago.

In addition, the last three years have demonstrated a new
European interest in playing a more relevant role in the
international context, reaching beyond the diplomatic dimension
to include the indispensable **military capability for action. For**
this purpose the European Union (EU) has set the **“Headline**
**Goal” of having in 2003 a Rapid Reaction Force capable of**
fulfilling the Petersberg missions, which according to the EU
Treaty include **humanitarian and rescue tasks; peacekeeping**
**tasks; and tasks of combat forces in crisis management,**
including peacemaking.

With this institutional capability for decision-making and
action, the EU becomes a true strategic actor, altering the security
panorama to some extent. The Atlantic dimension represented by
NATO is no longer the only one; now, if necessary, Europeans may
develop their own missions autonomously, taking on a new
responsibility. For this purpose the **concept of “Petersberg Plus”**
**missions are now being considered as a means of incorporating the**
fight against terrorism and other tasks. This is presently being
debated in the “European Convention”.

**2.- A New Sense of Vulnerability**

In the last few years history, instead of slowing down, has
increased its momentum. The dramatic September 11, 2001 terrorist
attacks on New York and Washington, D.C. transformed the
strategic scenario. We have moved from a recent horizon free from
obvious threats into a new sense of vulnerability, where peace
missions are no longer sufficient and **military action once again**
**takes on an increasingly important role.**


-----

The terrorist threat is now at the forefront and the fight against
it has become a key element in defence and security organisation
**strategies. Though NATO had just completed a profound**
transformation towards the end of the nineties, it began once more
a period of adaptation to the new circumstances due to the
commitments to collective defence established by its Article 5. Once
again NATO members took part in a **general reflection process**
concerning the future implications for the Armed Forces of the fight
against external terrorism.

The **European Union has also begun to adjust its European**
Security and Defence Policy (ESDP) in order to adequately meet this
new threat, although it still has a long road to travel.

**3.- A Revolution in Military Affairs**

It is evident that the changes taking place in society in general
and specifically in certain technologies related to information have
repercussions in the area of defence, as manifest in the 1991 Gulf
War and again in the Afghanistan operations. This undeniable
**“Revolution in Military Affairs” includes, among other aspects, the**
use of new technology for command and control, precision weapons,
and delivery systems outside the reach of enemy weapons. There may
be some debate concerning the speed of development and
assimilation, and the final impact on the ways and means of
conducting operations, or on the operations themselves, but no
**country can escape the need to innovate if it plans to continue**
**playing a part on the international scene.**

Even though the future may see rapid qualitative progress in
domains such as data treatment, sensors and biotechnology
applications, military systems still tend to be very slow, extending the
design, production and implementation processes for the principal
systems and platforms over a period of decades, especially in times of


-----

financial constraints. Therefore, as stated in this Strategic Review, it
will be important to **carefully evaluate what Armed Forces we**
**need and want to have by 2015 in order to begin a gradual process**
of transformation in that direction.

**4.- A Change in Social Values**

Alongside the technological revolution there have also been

**substantial changes in social values.**

The new information-centred technological revolution of the
last quarter of a century has transformed the way societies relate to
each other in a globalised world.

Our societies are increasingly influenced by a materialist
perspective emphasising the pursuit of individual well-being and
personal success with the minimum effort required. The result is a
decreasing acceptance of personal sacrifice, although there are still
many daily examples of solidarity.

Related to this change in social values are **new demands for**
**military action, imposing a new logic of action seen most clearly in**
the increasing rejection of collateral damage and casualties among
our own forces. One of its outcomes has been an increased use of
**intelligent weapons.**

**5.- Globalisation, the Media and Public Opinion**

The **globalisation** phenomenon has a considerable impact on
the **media, which in turn influences governments and political**
leaders significantly as they seek to meet the demands of the public
**opinion.**

In the new information era the media also plays a key role in
transmitting information to the public. It helps create opinions and


-----

modify citizen conduct and attitudes, thus influencing the process of
**decision-making concerning military actions.**

In sum, new technologies (such as the internet, mobile cell
phones, satellite networks, etc.) are changing the way the media
covers world news and how citizens receive information from the
media. This information-providing effect has shown itself to be so
powerful that in many cases it determines leaders’ actions in the
area of security, which in turn has fostered an **information**
**warfare.**

**6.- A Shared Process**

The current Spanish Strategic Review process is not an isolated
phenomenon, since Spain logically shares the same security
conditions and is exposed to the same changes in its strategic
environment as the rest of its allies. All have perceived the need to
adapt their defence orientation and structures, and have dealt with
this in different ways since the beginning of the nineties, when it was
clear that the Cold War had been left behind.

**The term “Strategic Review” was first officially used in 1998**
by the British Government led by Tony Blair, which published a
document that inspired the Labour party’s new era in security and
defence matters. Since the beginning of the nineties the **United**
**States has also gone through successive revisions of its strategy and**
defence. Recently the Pentagon developed its second Quadrennial
Defense Review, presented to Congress in September of 2001 after
the change in Administration. On September 20, 2002, the White
House made public “The National Security Strategy of the United
States”, describing the new strategic model for American defence
and its vision of the structure of international society after
September 11[th].


-----

Other countries such as Germany, Belgium, Finland, Norway,
**Italy, Greece and Japan have also recently completed their defence**
reviews.

It is important to recall that in 1991 the **Atlantic Alliance**

elaborated its own “Strategic Concept”, reflecting the changes in
the Eastern Block, the disappearance of the massive threat and the
appearance of new multi-dimensional and omni-directional risks.
It also proposed decreasing force structure size while at the same
time making them much less static. After the experiences of the
nineties and the need for peace support intervention in the Balkans
and other regions of the world, NATO once again elaborated a
**“New Strategic Concept” in 1999. Approved at the Washington**
summit commemorating the 50[th] anniversary of the creation of the
Alliance, this time the concept was oriented much more towards
new peace exporting missions. The approval of the “military
concept for defence against terrorism” at the **Prague Summit**
introduced important elaborations on the 1999 text in areas such
as prevention measures, actions “wherever they are needed”, and
inter-allied consultations in accord with the progression of the
crisis.

Along with its impact on strategy and defence, September 11[th]

has forced nations to redesign their strategic concepts. Of particular
importance was the publication of a new chapter in the Strategic
Review carried out by the United Kingdom’s Ministry of Defence.
Finalized in 1999, it focussed exclusively on the new terrorist threat.
At that time Spain was in the midst of the review process and was
able to directly incorporate the lessons learned. Although several
prior documents already considered terrorism as a threat, its
international appearance has clearly been more virulent and dramatic
than expected.


-----

**7.- A New Cycle for Spain**

The Strategic Review is not simply an adaptation to changes in
strategic circumstances. It is also a response to the increasing **role**
**that Spain should play in the concert of nations, and the weight**
**that defence and Armed Forces carry in fulfilling this.**

**Thus, one phase of Spanish defence has ended and another has**
**begun. Spain has been firmly anchored in the institutional framework**
of the Atlantic Alliance since its full incorporation into the newly
renovated NATO command structure. Presently, Spain is also actively
committed to developing a series of **military capabilities for**
**autonomous action within the European Union in an effort to help**
consolidate it as a full-fledged global actor. The mixed Services model
of conscripts and volunteers was left behind in the early nineties with
the disappearance of compulsory military service and the full
professionalisation of the Spanish Armed Forces, along with the
corresponding incorporation of women into all jobs and assignments.

**Merely extending present tendencies will hardly be sufficient**
**to meet the demands on our Armed Forces for more dynamic**
**external action on Spain’s part. The internationalisation of defence,**
along with the professionalisation and modernisation of the Services
towards the end of the nineties, were appropriate responses to the
needs of the times. Tomorrow’s Armed Forces will need to take these
changes into account, not merely assuming their present status or a
simple projection of present tendencies, but decidedly opting for
concepts, structures, and equipment that respond to future
problems.

**8.- Looking Ahead to 2015**

**The Strategic Review is intended as a guide for Spanish**
**Defence Policy in the mid- and long-range. It is an exercise in**


-----

reflection and analysis of the factors that will determine the strategic
possibilities open to our nation, which depend in good measure on
the international situation and the evolution of our context.
Therefore, its objective is to define the security and defence needs
**of our country, as a sovereign nation and in conjunction with our**
partners and allies, **and to determine the capabilities needed** to
ensure our national defence while seeking to fulfil the role that Spain
would like to play in the international arena.

**The Strategic Review expresses a future vision that gives**
meaning to the decisions that will be progressively adopted. The year
**2015, which has been set as the temporal horizon for this study, is**
undoubtedly far off, especially in light of the accelerated rate of
change in almost all spheres of our lives. But it is also prudent, since
defence building is a gradual process, and many of today’s decisions
have far-reaching implications.

Finally, the Strategic Review seeks to **open a broad political,**
**technical and social debate on the future of defence and the**
**Services. A new phase is beginning for Spain in the area of strategic**
culture and defence consciousness. While this will not be addressed
here, we may simply point out that throughout this process we are
making an **effort at transparency with the sole objective of**
providing a better and deeper understanding of the options before
us, as Spaniards and Europeans, in the areas of defence and
international security.

 NATIONAL INTERESTS AND SECURITY RISKS

**1.- Basic Security Interests**

As a fully sovereign nation, Spain defends the interests that are
**vital to its survival. These include** **Spain’s sovereignty,**
**independence, territorial integrity and constitutional order,**
along with ensuring the life, liberty and prosperity of the Spanish
**people, according to the terms established in the preamble to the**
Constitution. Within the context of our geographical and cultural
setting, our Nation should enjoy the vital conditions and
opportunities for prosperity that are in accord with the dignity and
lifestyle of the Spanish people.

In a global world it is also fundamental to achieve, in a manner
that reflects solidarity, a stable international order of peace, security
and respect for human rights. It is our social duty to guarantee that
intrinsic human values are respected. This is also a form of selfprotection, given that conflicts erupt when societies fall apart, thus
causing instability.

To the extent that Spain is increasingly active on the
international scene and our society is increasingly open and
interconnected with the rest of the world, the process of ensuring an
**arena for peace, liberty and prosperity constitutes another of our**
national security interests.

Spain shares with its European neighbours and other allies a

**global objective of contributing to international stability and**
**peace. This requires both readiness and willingness to participate**


-----

with its forces in the framework of multinational operations. Spain
**is willing to become involved in the scenarios that require our**
**presence, within the limits established by international law and our**
own possibilities and resources.

**2.- Shared Security**

Spanish national security is intrinsically and primarily linked to
the security of the European continent. In this sense, Spain desires to
directly contribute to safeguarding and increasing European peace
and stability, while also reducing its vulnerability.

**Spain supports a united Europe with the capability for**
**autonomous decision-making and action in the military arena,**
and in consequence, advocates the goal of endowing the **EU with**
military capabilities to meet contingencies and crises of varying
extent and intensity.

Nonetheless, Spain recognises that at present **the Atlantic**
**Alliance continues to be the spinal column of European defence.**
The final objective of a European defence by Europeans will not
endanger the Atlantic relationship but should tend to reinforce it.
For this reason Spain also supports an enlarged and transformed
**NATO, with greater military capabilities for action and openness to**
new global challenges such as external terrorism.

**3.- Regional Stability**

Spain’s security is also linked to the general stability of the
**Mediterranean area. In order to transform the Mediterranean into**
an area of peace, stability and shared prosperity, the dialogue and
cooperation process known as Euromediterranean partnership was
initiated with the Barcelona Declaration of 1995. Due to our
unique geographical situation as a veritable crossroads of two


-----

worlds, Spain finds itself playing a highly relevant and increasingly
influential role in **North Africa and the** **Mediterranean Sea,**
fostering a growing dialogue and understanding between peoples
on both shores.

In addition, the location of the Canary Islands and their
geostrategic importance underscore the need to ensure stability in
that area of the Atlantic.

**4.- The Main Risks to our Security**

At present it does not seem likely that Spain will experience a

**large-scale armed aggression against its national territory or**
maritime and air space, at least in the classical sense.

However, the rise of the **external terrorism phenomenon, of**
global reach and great capacity to inflict harm, exposes us to new
situations of national vulnerability. In order to face this new risk
**from beyond our borders, it will be necessary to make use of the**
Armed Forces’ capabilities whenever governmental authorities
consider it appropriate.

Along with external terrorism, the greatest threat to our stability
may come from the proliferation of nuclear, biological, chemical
**and radiological (NBCR) weapons of mass destruction and their**
delivery systems, especially ballistic and cruise missiles. So **Spain**
**must give priority to the establishment of collective measures**
**and actions that include anti-missile defence systems,** **in order to**
**halt this proliferation phenomenon of both the NBCR weapons**
and their delivery systems.

It is also evident that the geographical situation of Spain’s

**national territory, which includes** **its islands and rock**
**formations and the Spanish cities of Ceuta and Melilla in North**


-----

Africa, can be a source of greater risks to our own integrity. This
undoubtedly constitutes one of the key factors of our nation’s
defensive strategy.

The main lines of communication that supply basic resources

to our country, particularly energy, run through the straits of
Gibraltar. The geographical concentration of these commercial
routes makes them unavoidably vulnerable, and an interruption of
them would necessarily be considered a very serious potential risk,
both in regards to the ease of interruption and its repercussions.

The British colony on Gibraltar and the **limitation of the**
**exercise of sovereignty** that it implies constitutes not only a
distorting factor for Spain’s external action but may also present
other problems. Certain military operations can be undertaken from
the Rock without Spanish participation and carried out upon spaces
of strategic interest to our country, such as the accesses to
Mediterranean and Atlantic waters.

**5.- Other Risks**

Among the new emerging risks we may emphasize the negative
**effects of globalisation. To the extent that it links some actors and**
regions more closely with others, globalisation acts as a risk
multiplier, permitting a rapid propagation of effects.

Among these global phenomena are environmental attacks and
**aggressions, which may have very serious consequences, particularly**
in the case of nuclear installations or military vessels or aircraft,
carrying nuclear weapons systems or using nuclear propulsion.

It is also important to consider problems potentially derived
from **extraordinary and uncontrolled migratory movements,**
mainly caused by the displacement of people groups affected by


-----

shortages, conflict or catastrophes, and encouraged by transnational
organisations dedicated to trafficking in human beings.

Given the extreme dependence of modern societies on
information and communication systems, there is also a growing risk
of serious harm from assaults on communications nodes through
**cyber attacks. In the area of defence, the Armed Forces must ensure**
the protection of their own capacity for action and the operative
survival of their basic infrastructures, especially communications,
command and control systems.

The September 11 attacks have clearly shown that **an**
**unperceived threat is not any less real or dangerous. Even in the**
absence of a defined threat, it is every government’s responsibility to
encourage and ensure basic defence measures aimed at avoiding
catastrophic surprises. Therefore, Spain’s primary interest is a
**sufficiently robust defence that is not hostage to actions that could**
decrease its flexibility and capacity for adaptation.

Finally, it is important to have Armed Forces that are open to
**change, since a focus on the familiar can be counterproductive in**
times of uncertainty.

**6.- Scenarios of Action**

The position of Spain in the international arena necessarily
forces it towards high priority geostrategic locations for action due
to geographical, historical, cultural, economical and other factors.
These areas constitute our preferred scenarios for action.

This does not mean that in defending our national interests we
cannot act anywhere in the world if necessary. But action outside our
**preferred scenarios must be considered as** **exceptional in character**
and cannot be the rule for determining the size of our Armed Forces.


-----

### III

 THE ARMED FORCES’ MISSIONS

**1.- From Territorial Defence to Force Projection**

Following the suffering caused by the two World Wars in the
first half of the 20[th] century, the United Nations Charter codified a
principle **generally condemning war and the use of force, with**
**legitimate defence as the only exception. This conception has**
endured up through the present: Armed Forces are to be instruments
for repelling and defending oneself from an aggressor, responding in
order to protect the territory and borders of the national State.
During its first forty years of existence, the Atlantic Alliance proved
to be the best expression of this strategic conception by the UN.

To a certain degree this logic broke down during the nineties
with the surfacing of civil conflicts in the so-called “failed states”.
NATO itself recognised in its 1999 **Strategic Concept that first**
magnitude military means dedicated to the defence of its members’
territories were no longer sufficient to guarantee international peace
and stability. In this new context, armies are now seen as ideal
instruments to **alleviate the suffering of countries torn by civil**
**conflict, and also to impose a peaceful and stable order in those**
**countries.**

The development of the new peace missions of the nineties

meant a shift from an essentially static defence of national and allied
soil to a much broader geographical area of action and to military
capabilities based primarily on the projection and deployment of
forces over prolonged periods of time in more or less far-off settings.
Among their missions, armies created for national defence now have


-----

the principal task of projecting stability, with all the consequences
that this implies for their means and structures.

The September 11 terrorist attacks clearly marked a new phase
in the evolution of defence. By activating the article 5 commitments
expressed in its foundational Treaty, the Atlantic Alliance is willing
to assume an active role in non-conventional defence and in an area
removed from its zone of activity and interest. Furthermore,
interpreting the fight against global terrorism as a war, NATO has
reinforced the defence of its basic principles and the rights and
liberties of citizens in the face of new threats. This will require the
acquisition of new capabilities.

This **potential for projection, which allows us to meet the**
enemy as quickly as possible and wherever necessary, characterises
the present phase in which defence is seen and understood as an
active, flexible and dynamic instrument. In the absence of a clearly
identifiable and defined enemy, defence will not be determined
based on the counterweight required for a specific threat. Rather, it
will be built upon a series of generic capabilities aimed at meeting
**all the demands now placed upon the Armed Forces, from**
**national defence to collective defence, including peace missions;**
as well as maintaining a capacity to evolve when unexpected
requirements arise.

**2.- National Defence and Collective Defence**

The Armed Forces are undergoing a second process of change in
tandem with the one just outlined: **the transition from an**
**autarchic concept of defence - where each State relied exclusively**
on its own forces to meet its own risks and threats - to one in which
**defence is understood as a collective effort involving the**
contributions of several States and their Armed Forces to achieve the
common and linked goal of shared security.


-----

Today it is difficult to foresee a military situation in which
several countries do not act jointly. Although this requires uniting
efforts in economies of scale, it is easier to guarantee a sustained
effort over many months if several nations express political solidarity.
This may result in temporary ad hoc coalitions, since the
maintenance of international peace involves all, particularly those
most benefited by it.

In addition to the effort Spain must make at a collective level,
contributing to solidarity through the resources and material and
human means that it has available, it is still necessary to ensure self**defence, as an ever-present requirement for our Armed Forces given**
the present international panorama.

In sum, although the ultimate decision to commit national
troops and endanger their lives in a conflict continues to be a matter
in the field of national political sovereignty, the realities of military
experience point towards a consolidation of collective defence. The
need to be able to respond to collective demands, and to operate
with the Armies of allied countries, leads to the internationalisation
**or multinationalisation of defence. This is expressed in new**
concepts, forms and procedures as well as material programs that can
only be developed and understood from a perspective that extends
beyond the national arena. The missions of the Armed Forces will be
determined by this vision of defence as a collective endeavour.

**3.- Lines of Strategic Action**

In order to adequately face the realities of the new national and
international context, the goal of the Spanish strategy is to support
the national objectives and share them with a group of nations and
institutions that pursue the common goal of contributing to
international peace and security.


-----

With this objective in mind, the national security policy

should be based on the following instruments:

-  Deterrence

Deterrence is built upon the exercise of power as a means to
maintain peace, spanning every area that falls within the realm of
State action. National and alliance-based military capabilities of
**sufficient strength and preparation are necessary for this purpose;**
and the corresponding national, international or allied community
with their various leaders must demonstrate unequivocally a firm
and decisive will to use them.

The fundamental aspects that give credibility to deterrence are
the maintenance of a national military capability, and its readiness
**and availability** to act jointly through collective defence or in
coalition with allies and other friendly countries.

-  Cooperation

Cooperation is the act of interdependence of individuals and
organisations seeking certain objectives through a rapprochement in
their policies instead of using physical or material coercion.

At present it is clear that no nation can expect to be successful in
meeting the current multiplicity of risks alone. Thus it is necessary
to **reinforce links with other countries that share common**
**interests, in order to find** **multilateral solutions through joint**
efforts. It is also important to strengthen peaceful relations with
these nations, especially in our own geographical setting, recognising
that cooperation is based on communication, coordination and
convergence of efforts in areas of interest for those involved.

Clear and unequivocal support in areas of cooperation such as
education, instruction, training, joint production and aid in


-----

sustainability pave the way for peace and goodwill, even with
countries that have conflicting interests with us.

-  Prevention

In the new security conception, prevention is action intended
**to avoid the tensions, instabilities and crises that lead to conflicts**
and, in situations where conflicts do arise, to address their causes and
seek to contain them in their early phases and places of origin in
order to limit the efforts and means required once they develop.

Therefore it is important to respond to specific situations in a
timely and ad hoc manner, using an adequate combination of
political, diplomatic, economic and military instruments.

-  Stability projection

This is the **capability to exert influence in other regions in**
order to reduce tensions and instabilities while fostering the
establishment of stable democracies and market economies.

Military participation in peace missions has established an

**external Spanish presence and can serve as an example for reducing**
political tensions, increasing economic interdependence and
achieving greater mutual trust in other regions.

-  Response

This is the capability to react, in an adequate fashion, in the
**face of any possible aggression against the national interests or**
those of allies and friendly countries. This would imply that
preventive measures have been inadequate, leading to the unleashing
of response procedures that may be in solitary or in alliances or
coalitions with other States.


-----

**4.- General Missions of the Armed Forces**

The ultimate purpose of an army is to ensure national security
in the face of any risk that may threaten to endanger it. But this
function of defence can and should be broken down into more
concrete missions. Hence, the **general missions of the Armed**
**Forces are organised into various other missions derived from the**
**general ones.**

The new Armed Forces see their usefulness outlined in **three**
**broad missions: defensive missions, missions related to**
international cooperation, and missions to support States’ civil
administrations.

So the **first general mission of the Armed Forces can be no**
other than to impede any type of aggression and respond to it if
**necessary.**

From a purely defensive perspective the Armed Forces should be
endowed and organised to project a deterrence capability upon any
potential aggressor, discouraging any possible attack as early as
possible. But if deterrence fails and an armed aggression occurs, the
Armed Forces should be capable of repelling that aggression before
it causes irreparable harm. They should also be able to carry out
operations until success in the confrontation has been achieved
according to the terms set by the Government.

As seen in the events of September 11, 2001, it is possible for an
international aggression to materialise and strike national soil
without clearly penetrating the national borders or presenting a
specific enemy battle line. So it is important to realise that national
defence may not always occur on or close to home soil. Another
strategic requirement is force projection to far-off places, along with
the defence of national territory, air and maritime spaces.


-----

Although **military intelligence is essential in every type of**
mission, in this general mission it is particularly relevant as an
indispensable element of an effective prevention policy and of the
eventual exercise of any legitimate defence action.

Spanish security does not depend only on what occurs in our
immediate environment. It is also highly dependent on the security
**of the European area and on world stability. As a result, Spain is**
committed to regional defence organisations such as the Atlantic
Alliance, and clearly favours the development of a security and
defence policy within the European Union; Spain is also willing to
take part in multinational coalitions. For these reasons, the Armed
Forces’ second general mission is to have a military contribution
**to international peace and stability.**

Formerly, collective defence commitments required military
solidarity when faced with a direct aggression against a member of
the organisation, whether NATO or the Western European Union
(WEU). After September 11, this generic task of solidarity in reestablishing the _ante bellum status quo may require military and_
combat activities in places other than the site of the initial
aggression. Thus, the Spanish Armed Forces must be prepared to
**act wherever the situation requires it and in the multinational**
**framework most appropriate at the time, while always**
**maintaining respect for international legality.**

During the nineties it became evident that local conflicts can
threaten the stability of an entire zone and, once they become
regional, can affect the entire world. This involves not only the direct
or indirect repercussions of wars, such as refugee movements; there
are also other outcomes which are considered morally unacceptable
by Western societies, such as the violence unleashed during tribal and
ethnic wars, and continuous violations of human rights. In the


-----

nineties a new moral imperative for intervention in defence of third
parties was developed in order to impose - if necessary - a peaceful
**solution to conflicts, even by the use of force.**

It is also important to highlight the tasks of defence diplomacy,
oriented towards fostering friendly relations and collaboration with
the Armed Forces of other countries. This is expressed in cooperation
agreements, exchanges of officers in academies, visits to installations
and units, etc.

Finally, the Armed Forces assume as their third and last general
**mission a role in** **contributing alongside other State and Public**
Administration institutions to the preservation of citizen security
**and well being.**

Due to their organisation, structure, preparation and means, the
Armed Forces can sometimes participate in certain **tasks that are**
**characteristic of the civil administration. These tasks mobilise**
military resources but do not require the use of force, in contrast
with other types of missions.

The Armed Forces play a very important role in civil emergency
**situations caused by natural or human catastrophes, ranging from**
flood relief interventions to soil decontamination, such as took place
in Doñana after the Aznalcóllar dam broke in 1998. More recently
all the Spanish Armed Forces have participated in joint efforts to
resolve the ecological catastrophe resulting from the sunken **oil**
**tanker “Prestige”.**

**The Armed Forces are at the National Government’s disposal**

for general use in tasks deemed appropriate for its form of
functioning or when other institutions are temporarily unable to
carry them out. For example, **Army troops have been involved in**
border control in Ceuta and Melilla, as well as protecting


-----

communication lines within the Peninsula from possible terrorist
attacks. The Navy has agreements with the Ministry of the Interior
to participate in capturing ships suspected of transporting drugs, and
is involved in surveillance to ensure the enforcement of
environmental protection laws against potential threats from ships
carrying hazardous or contaminating materials. The **Air Force**
participates in emergency or priority transport needs, and also aids
in fire-fighting missions with the Autonomous Communities.

Since the September 11 attacks, **the Armed Forces have also**
been involved in providing security at large international events held
in this country, such as the recent meetings of the European Council
in Barcelona (March 2002) and in Seville (June 2002).


-----

### IV

 THE ARMED FORCES IN THE 21[ST] CENTURY

**1.- Basic Requirements and Critical Capabilities for the Armed**
**Forces**

In 1999 the Atlantic Alliance’s work led to the development
**of six basic characteristics of modern Armed Forces capable of**
responding to the challenges of the new strategic environment.
These characteristics are:

-  Mobility and capability for projection

Given that the foci of instability and potential theatres of
operation are far removed from the permanent bases of the
forces, and due to the need to act as quickly as possible in a
crisis, it is important for forces to have not only tactical but
also strategic mobility. They must have the capability to be
deployed and placed at a considerable distance in a short
period of time; the recent events in the Persian Gulf (1991)
and Afghanistan (2002) are some of the clearest examples of
this.

-  Sustainability

The deployment of troops far from national territory, normally
in areas lacking the necessary infrastructures, requires a significant
logistic effort to maintain supplies and materiel for these forces. This
is especially the case when the original time frame for missions is
prolonged in far-off theatres.


-----

-  Availability

Along with permanent training and equipping, military units
must have a level of readiness in accord with the probable needs of
their job, the mission or missions assigned to them, and the expected
period of assignment to larger forces.

-  Superiority in the conflict

Even during peace missions forces cannot always expect to
operate in a permissive environment, especially when imposing
peace. The systems they use should guarantee superiority, to assure
victory in case of a conflict. Intelligent weapons and remote
controlled firing systems, which are highly lethal and provide low
exposure to the enemy, help create an advantageous situation from
the outset.

-  Protection

The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their
delivery means, along with the potential for exposure to highly
contaminating elements, require that special attention be given to
the protective equipment needs of our forces, both collectively and
individually (i.e. use of NBC suits and masks); also requiring
protection are the command structures and the troops themselves
(by tactical anti-missile systems, etc.).

**• Integrated command and control**

In an information-dominated world, an essential key to military
success involves knowing what is happening on the ground and
gaining advantage over the opponent during the decision cycle. It is
therefore necessary to have systems capable of gathering and
analysing information from the battlefield, as well as disseminating
intelligence and the resulting instructions to those involved. This


-----

must all be done in real time, making it crucial that all elements
supporting the decision cycle be perfectly integrated: command,
control, communications, computers, surveillance, reconnaissance
and intelligence.

The latest campaigns have confirmed these six basic
characteristics defined by NATO but have also highlighted certain
**capabilities that are** **critical for future success in the new Armed**
Forces missions. Though they may fit within some of the prior
points, they have now acquired greater relevance. These include:

**• Continual surveillance, reconnaissance, intelligence and**
**target acquisition (ISTAR)**

When faced with an evasive enemy, forces should be able to
obtain information control through permanent surveillance, which
requires a sufficient number of reconnaissance and surveillance
systems. Although unmanned vehicles become increasingly
important as they gain sophistication and capabilities, permanent
coverage of a theatre of operations will only be possible through the
integration of diverse and overlapping systems, from space-based
elements to ground units.

**• Modularity and interoperability of forces**

Responding to very diverse contingencies requires highly flexible
command elements along with troops capable of reconstitution and
effective operation, such as a Combined Joint Task Force (CJTF).
This in turn requires interoperable communications elements, a
joint action doctrine and common procedures.

**• Joint action**

Joint action is based on the use of specific forces under one same
command, with unified procedures and mutual support criteria,


-----

which permit more efficient and effective accomplishment of their
assigned missions.

Recent experiences in Afghanistan and other more or less remote
military conflicts have reinforced the idea that joint action is
indispensable for carrying out military operations.

**• The importance of Special Forces**

Manifestly suitable jobs for special operations forces include
reconnaissance, target acquisition, and search and rescue, along with
other liaison, training and non-conventional tasks. Special forces
training and doctrine of use fit excellently with new generation
combat, where mobility, dispersal and invisibility are important.

**• Net-centric capability**

The events following September 11, 2001 confirmed a series of
ideas and concepts developed in prior years. The new
multidimensional concept of conflict led by globalisation in the
information and communication fields, combining traditional
means with the latest technological advances, require the principal
actors to stay permanently interconnected, that is, network-centric.

The latest campaigns, carried out over a broad low-density
theatre, required at all times a high degree of interconnection
between the forces deployed in order to achieve the desired results.
The future need to link all combat elements in real time requires a
veritable fusion of today’s information networks.

**2.- Asymmetric Warfare**

Since the **September 11 attacks** and their dramatic
demonstration of catastrophic terrorism, traditional armies face the
new phenomenon of an enemy that uses an asymmetrical approach:


-----

the enemy itself is essentially asymmetrical and non-conventional.
Modern armies must be prepared to deter or disrupt actions by
similar conventional forces, while also being able to respond to a
whole gamut of **non-conventional threats that are continually**
increasing in number, lethal power and accessibility to States and
substate groups.

The fact that traditional military superiority does not
automatically mean increased security or effectiveness in stopping
asymmetrical attacks creates an entirely new situation on the
strategic panorama and requires a thorough revision of modern
defence’s tenets and means.

**3.- General Tendencies**

**Tomorrow’s wars will not be like those of the past, nor will**
future strategic environment conditions be like those of today.
However, this Strategic Review focuses on a temporal horizon that is
relatively short, and this makes it possible to discern the changes
required of our Armed Forces and defence.

Thus, the Army must continue its transformation towards units
that permit easier projection, have greater deployment capability,
and are modularly organised ad hoc for the specific mission. In order
to combine greater tactical mobility with sufficient strike capability,
it will be necessary to lighten the heavy armament. The key to
success lies in rapid projection capacity, pursuing effectiveness in
combat.

The transformation of the Navy involves a re-orientation of its
fleet away from its oceanic and anti-submarine focus. It must
become a force primarily capable of power projection in littoral and
coastal waters, reaching all the way into the interior as well.


-----

The **Air Force must move towards acquiring precision-guided**
strike weapons, along with the air transport means for projecting
forces. It should also take advantage of new unmanned vehicle
technologies, and particularly of space–based systems.

In any case, the true transformation of military and defence
capabilities will come about as a new way of understanding the effort
of each Service within a joint and integrated action.

**4.- A New Mentality**

In the Armed Forces the material element is important, but the
human factor is even more decisive, if possible. It is men and women
who make armies, not their machines. In this sense, new systems and
technological elements - in and of themselves - are insufficient for
meeting the defence challenges of the 21[st] century. What is needed
above all else is a **mindset open to changes, able to explore and**
experiment when faced with a changing and uncertain future. This
new mentality must emphasize joint and multinational approaches
by means of a reformed and revised educational system and
structure.


-----

### PARAMETERS OF THE REVIEW

**1.- The Human Factor**

Even in the highly technical and automated Armed Forces of the
future, the key and determining factor will still be the quality of
**its human resources. In this regard the final objective of the**
personnel policy is not only to meet the numerical needs of the
Services, but most of all to recruit and retain quality personnel who
will receive regular training. This would consolidate a professional
Armed Forces model composed of human resources that are perfectly
integrated into an organisation operated on principles of
effectiveness and efficiency.

The Armed Forces should have professional military personnel

**in accord with the quantity and quality required for the missions**
assigned. These include the usual missions in times of peace and
others involving immediate responses to contingencies, in order to
provide a sufficient presence in areas of national sovereignty and to
deter possible threats.

For this reason it is important to articulate measures that take
into account the following parameters:

**- The** **resource planning process will be carried out with**
special emphasis on: redefining the rate of cadre in relation
to neighbouring countries; **empowering the category of**
**non-career officers[1]** for greater flexibility in determining and

1
Translator’s note: Militar de complemento, in Spanish.


-----

adjusting staff; having technically prepared **civil personnel**
available to respond to the needs of the Armed Forces, which
requires training activities to incorporate and maintain them
in adequate numbers; adopting and developing the **concept**
**of reserves, both in their quality and availability in order to**
permit a supplementary influx of human resources in an agile,
constant and timely fashion.

**- Improving the integration of the Armed Forces within**
**society, providing motivating factors for each personnel**
group; establishing an equivalence between their specific
regimes and civil servants in regard to income, pension plans
and social support; establishing equivalencies with the
national educational system for military degrees; maintaining
the unique characteristics of the military career and fostering
geographical mobility.

**- Optimising human resources by outsourcing services, thus**
liberating operational personnel from tasks that can be carried
out by specialised companies.

**- Adopting the necessary steps to** **reincorporate temporary-**
service military professionals into **civilian life, including**
them in ministerial job finding programs and specifying their
possibilities in the corporate realm.

**2.- Material and Technological Factors**

A series of technologies that had been developing at an
unprecedented rate were progressively incorporated into weapons
systems in the nineties, in what has been labelled a Revolution in
**Military Affairs, giving rise to Services that actually constitute a**
**system of systems. Especially notable among these technologies are:**
**reconnaissance and surveillance systems, that seek to make the**


-----

battlefield transparent; **software programming applied to**
**command and control systems in order to process all the**
information and thus maintain an adequate decision-making rate;
and long-range intelligent weapons that are very precise and lethal.

Even though the **Revolution in Military Affairs obviously**
implies a serious budgetary effort, any Service seeking to act jointly
with other allies must develop in areas linked to new technologies.
In Spain’s case the modernisation of the Armed Forces’ materiel is
**a continual process that is primarily determined by the global**
strategic situation, our international commitments, and the available
economic resources. The intent is to meet the needs of our Armed
**Forces by supplying them with the best weapons systems,**
**equipment and support infrastructure to be able to effectively**
**fulfil their assigned missions.**

In any case, Spain must accelerate the process of achieving full

**compatibility of its communications, intelligence and command**
**and control systems between its three Services and with its allies.**

Acquisition commitments for important platforms during the
next fifteen years represent a very high portion of the budget
destined to new materiel; which means that it will be important to
find an adequate balance between the present number of existing
**platforms and the acquisition of new ones.**

Even though the main programs’ platforms are soon to be
operational and will be a milestone for Spain’s defence, the Armed
Forces also require new equipment and infrastructure programs,
that are equally necessary in order to respond to future challenges
and threats to national and international security needs.

Those programs should include developing and acquiring

**unmanned systems equipped with various sensors and systems that**


-----

allow **the detection, surveillance, identification and acquisition**
**of targets; incorporating new types of sensors that permit** **remote**
**detection capacity; and increasing the** **capability for satellite**
**communications, both for general and exclusively military use.**

It is also important to support the political objective of a

**European Armaments Policy for the European Union, in order to**
create a competitive and technologically advanced industrial base.
Therefore, it is necessary to continue consolidating demand in
Europe by harmonising operational requirements, cooperating in
**Research and Development (R&D) matters as well as Innovation,**
**and developing multinational weapons programs.**

In the face of undeniable threats due to the proliferation of
weapons of mass destruction, it is indispensable that we improve
**the self-defence capabilities of the contingents exposed to this risk**
by providing updated individual and collective protection
equipment against NBCR agents.

**3.- Towards Greater Projection, Mobility and Interoperability**

**The key to success** in any future military operation, and to
Spanish participation, lies in our capability for early response by
rapid deployment of the required forces in an increasingly vast
theatre of operations. For Spain this basically means three things:

**- Increasing air transport capability, which will be achieved at**
some point with the new A400M aircraft.

**- Improving the capability to project amphibious and ground**
**forces, adding new elements to amphibious assault ships so as**
to enable projection of an entire Brigade, as well as providing
the necessary logistic support for other operations through
ground contingents proximate to the littoral.


-----

**- Increasing the deployment capability of combat aircraft, in**
order to send them and their support wing anywhere in the
world in the shortest possible timeframe.

There are four priority measures to adopt concerning mobility:

**- The acquisition of a new generation** **attack helicopter**

equipped with the latest all-weather day/night navigation
systems, self-protection and intelligent weapons systems;
which is ultimately the only way to guarantee superiority over
anti-helicopter systems and tanks.

**- Replacement of the** **transport helicopter fleet to ensure**
tactical transport and logistic support for land units.

**- A progressive incorporation alongside heavy tanks of a new**
type of wheeled vehicle with similar firepower and, above all
else, transportable by air.

**- Replacement of the** **submarine units in order to maintain**
freedom of action and force mobility.

**Interoperability** has become increasingly important over the
last decade and is now being considered as a means of multiplying
the combat capability of 21[st] century armies. Spain’s vision of Armed
Forces that are interoperable with our allies has led our efforts to be
directed towards the following areas:

**- Use of common doctrine and procedures, interoperability in**

**communications and** **information systems (CIS) and**
equipment, as well as the capability to interchange **combat**
**supplies to facilitate mutual collaboration.**

**- Reducing the technological gap between European**
countries and the United States by increasing and improving


-----

interoperability, in order to minimise the consequences of this
technological distance as much as possible.

**- Standardisation of equipment, supplies and procedures,**
considered as a critical factor that must be taken into account
in designing and producing new systems and equipment.

**4.- A Rationalisation of Structures**

Both to generate the capabilities required by the Services in the
coming years and to continue meeting contingencies effectively and
efficiently as successive international crises arise, a more simplified
**structure is necessary in order to coordinate administrative**
**procedures and direct operations. The new model for this will**
undoubtedly be the creation of a single centre that jointly and
individually integrates the Central Organ[2] and the Service
Headquarters. Progress must also be made to streamline the
organisation of the chain of military command and the force’s units,
resulting in a more integrated and simplified structure. Therefore:

**- The Central Organ of the Ministry of Defence must assume**
full responsibility for defence systems acquisitions. The
present **Directorate General for Armament and Materiel,**
dependent on the **Secretary of State for Defence, must be**
empowered to autonomously manage defence acquisitions
and procurement, centralising all purchases and directly
assuming **non-operational logistics under terms yet to be**
specified, independently of the specific logistics that are
channelled through the individual networks to each Service.

**- A clear division of responsibilities will be established between**
the Service Chiefs of Staff in charge of force preparation and
**operations commands responsible for the final use of the force.**

2
Translator’s note: Administrative headquarters.


-----

**- An Operations Command will be created for planning and**
executing all operations. **This Command will be**
**subordinate to the Chief of the Defence Staff (CHOD),**
who is to advise the Government as well as being responsible
for strategic oversight and direction.

**- The process of** **rationalising the** **intelligence capabilities of**
the Defence Staff and the three Services, which began with the
creation of the Armed Forces Intelligence Centre (CIFAS),
will be consolidated into an integral system under the
authority of the Chief of the Defence Staff.

**- Territorial structures will be eliminated (Regions, Zones**
and peripheral structure), **to be replaced by a functional**
**organisation.**

**- The peripheral organisation** of the Ministry of Defence

**will be reorganised** for greater coordination and
effectiveness.

**- The rationalisation process of the Education Centres will**
**continue in order to achieve greater unification.**

**- The Armed Forces will continue the process of reducing**
**the number of units deployed, in order to concentrate on**
fewer sites as determined by its operational needs.

**- Land Forces will be organised operatively in a modular**
**fashion for easier, more flexible potential use in multinational**
structures.

**- The present defence attachés regime will be reformed** to
better fulfil the responsibilities arising from modern Defence
Diplomacy.


-----

**5.- A New Strategic Dimension**

Spain left behind its strategic isolation and autarchy in the area
of defence with membership in NATO and the WEU, in 1982 and
1988 respectively. This allowed Spain to become actively involved
alongside European countries and allies in the **architecture of**
**shared security and collective defence, in order to meet serious**
potential threats to its security.

Nonetheless, certain experiences have shown the need for

**military capabilities to prevent any fait accompli policy and ensure**
respect for international law. Even with the support of the Atlantic
Alliance and the European Union, it is evident that our Armed
Forces need to have a permanent capability to handle self-defence
tasks.

In recent years there has been increasing development of an
autonomous European Union capability for decision-making and
action in defence. Spain should strongly support a **Union with**
**defensive capacity. But it should also go beyond the present limits**
defined by the Helsinki commitments of 1999.

In fact, Spain should defend:

**- Broadening missions beyond the limits of the so-called**

**Petersberg** tasks. The European Force can and should be
called upon to act in other types of contingencies such as
external terrorism.

**- Establishing a more autonomous planning capability within**
the EU as well as developing certain capabilities that are
considered **“necessary duplications”** with NATO,
especially in areas such as communications and command
and control.


-----

At a transatlantic level, Spain will support reinforcing the
Alliance’s role in **defence against international terrorism, in**
addition to executing its traditional missions, by developing the
necessary **military capabilities to meet this threat and by**
establishing new relations with member countries and international
organisations.

Specifically, our country should encourage:

**- Improving anti-terrorist capabilities, in line with the efforts**
of the EU and NATO.

**- Cooperation in intelligence matters with other agencies and**
organisms.

**- Defence against weapons of mass destruction (NBCR).**

**- Establishing an adequate chain of command and control for**
military units deployed in operations against external
terrorism.

**- Protection and survival of the force in allied operations.**

### 1[ST] BASIC CRITERION

**“The Armed Forces, as the essential element of Defence**
**within the framework of the Ministry of Defence, constitute**
**a single cluster entity that integrates the actions of each of its**
**components: the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force. Its**
**activity is directed by the Minister of Defence, under the**
**authority of the President of the Government, within the**
**framework of Defence Policy and subject to Parliamentary**
**control.”**

In the last few years the conception of the **Armed Forces has**
evolved towards that of a single entity composed of the Army, Navy
and Air Force, not merely the sum of them. The Common Corps
are also included within the Armed Forces and are essential to their
normal functioning.

The present orientation and functioning of the Armed Forces
tends towards **joint action, due to the fact that an operational**
mission generally requires military forces from more than one
Service. But the term “joint action” normally expresses an intentional
integration of diversity, seeking the necessary synergy of efforts by
coordinating and optimising actions, in order to reach optimal
results for the whole.

The Armed Forces fit within the organic framework of the

**Ministry of Defence. They must possess the flexibility to develop**
the necessary capabilities for action wherever it is required, according
to the guidelines established by the Government.


-----

The **President of the Government, exercising his or her**
constitutional powers as the person responsible for governmental
**action, uses this authority to direct the actions and use of the**
**Armed Forces.**

The Minister of Defence assumes the execution of Security
**and Defence objectives set by the Government, developing the**
corresponding Defence Policy from which the Defence Objectives
and basic lines of action are derived.

As a result, the Minister of Defence defines and formulates a

**National Defence planning process to ensure coordination of**
efforts between the Armed Forces and the other organisms in this
Ministry, thereby making its contribution to Security and Defence.
Force level, available resources, priorities for investment programs
and other measures to supply the necessary material and human
means for the Armed Forces missions will be established based on
these directives.


-----

### 2[ND] BASIC CRITERION

**“The defence effort should be oriented towards the Force, which**
**is reason for the existence of the entire organisation.”**

The first premise of Defence must be to orient its effort towards

**the Force, which is the final reason for the existence of the entire**
Ministry and its organisation. For this purpose it will be necessary to
redefine, in a balanced way, the dimensions of Force Support, the
Service Headquarters and the Central Organ[3].

Just as the Force must be defined according to the Armed Forces
Missions and Tasks, so the Support of the Force and the Service
Headquarters must be constituted according to the needs of the
Force, with the sole objective of facilitating its adequate preparation
and rapid and efficient action. The same may be said for the rest of
the Ministry’s organisation, involved with prioritising, coordinating
and executing the general guidelines.

Past needs for a large number of forces to defend against massive
conventional enemy attacks have given way to new needs for forces
capable of rapid deployment to meet crises as they arise, in order to
control, limit and deter their development.

Although in the last few years the Spanish Armed Forces have made
significant efforts to **adapt to the new situation, this process must**
continue until adequate force is achieved, which is one more reason why
**defining the force should be one of the key objectives of this Review.**

3
Translator’s note: Administrative headquarters.


-----

### 3[RD] BASIC CRITERION

**“All units should be prepared for the most demanding combat**
**actions, even though they may carry out other types of**
**missions.”**

All Armed Forces units, especially those that constitute the main
combat forces, must be **sufficiently trained and adequately**
**supplied in personnel and materiel.**

The **quality of the Armed Forces, in personnel preparation,**
equipment and training must be comparable to allied forces.

Its structure, along with the empowering of interoperability, will
permit force groupings **capable of being integrated within**
**multinational forces, as a contribution to the allied effort, if the**
need arises.

The Atlantic Alliance’s Defence Capabilities Initiative,
approved at the Washington, D.C. summit of 1999, and the
Prague Capabilities Commitment of 2002, are intended to
provide the allied nations with forces that have deployment and
**combat capabilities to face an armed conflict in any**
**environment, especially long-term missions in far-off locations.**
Once these capabilities have been acquired, the Forces will also be
ready to act successfully in lower risk situations such as the
**“Petersberg” missions, to be developed by the European Union**
according to the military capabilities defined in the 1999
**“Headline Goal”.**


-----

A characteristic of current conflicts is the fact that they are
initiated from increasingly large distances, so that the use of military
power must rely on means and procedures that provide **greater**
**range and precision. Units capable of carrying out special**
operations gain importance, and the search for information has
become a crucial factor in modern conflicts. For this reason,
neighbouring countries are developing concepts that link the
activities involved in Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition
and Reconnaissance.

The tremendous destructive power of nuclear, biological and
chemical weapons and the difficulty in limiting their effects require
not only protection for the forces but also detection, evaluation and
decontamination measures to prevent their effects and reduce their
consequences.

Even though they may carry out other types of missions, all
**units must be organised and prepared for the most demanding**
**combat situations. Quality is a higher priority that quantity. They**
must all be provided with sufficient protection and adequate means
to contribute information concerning the situation.

**Rotation during long-term operations is necessary to provide**
rest and retraining for personnel and to carry out the necessary
maintenance and replenishment of materiel.

**Sustaining the effort requires Reaction Forces that are larger**
than the ones deployed, so they can be relieved in the operational
area by an adequate rotation of units.


-----

### 4[TH] BASIC CRITERION

**“The Armed Forces should be structured to respond effectively**
**to the new missions assigned to them in a joint and combined**
**context.”**

The Armed Forces must be organised to respond effectively
**to new missions that result from our national and international**
commitments, becoming an instrument in the State’s foreign policy
capable of making Spain’s presence visible in the world.

The future role of the new Armed Forces will be conceptualised

**within a joint and combined frame. The Services must be capable**
of placing the units, and the command and control capabilities
necessary for the established structures, at the disposal of the
Commands in charge, whether national or multinational.

For this reason the capabilities of the units contributed by Spain
must have **characteristics similar to those contributed by the**
**most advanced countries.**

Armed Forces intervention in the new conflicts must ensure

**rapid deployment** and **sustainment capability. This is an**
indispensable capability in all phases of the conflict: before, during
and after. This will enable the Armed Forces to fulfil all its assigned
missions, from humanitarian aid to those of highest intensity, as
needed for the resolution of the conflict.

In the 21[st] century Armed Forces must be a powerful tool
capable of achieving maximum effectiveness in resolving conflicts


-----

as quickly as possible with minimum damage, a step ahead of the
adversary. For this purpose they will have high strike capability and
the **most modern materiel and equipment, providing maximum**
precision, avoiding unnecessary collateral damage and increasing the
protection provided for our forces.

The Armed Forces will also be prepared to cooperate with civil
**authorities and other State organisms. New national requirements,**
such as supporting the civil population in certain situations and
protecting the environment, will give rise to new commitments for
the Armed Forces.

**Military operations will be increasingly conditioned by** **new**
**factors, such as public opinion and the media. In order to achieve**
maximum effectiveness in the use of available resources, the Armed
Forces must be capable of acting in coordination and harmony with
**new actors, who are increasingly relevant in different conflicts, such**
as international and non-governmental organisations.

Therefore the military organisation of 21[st] **century Armed**
**Forces must be increasingly functional, joint, operational and**
**have greater capability for external projection, so as to better**
defend national interests and the values Spain shares with its partners
and allies.


-----

### 5[TH] BASIC CRITERION

**“The Chief of the Defence Staff, as Operational Commander of**
**the Armed Forces, will be responsible for the strategic execution**
**of operations, exercising command over the components of the**
**operational structure of the Armed Forces. A new Operations**
**Command will be created, directly subordinate to the Chief of**
**the Defence Staff, and delegated the responsibility of carrying**
**out the execution of operations.”**

The responsibility for crisis or conflict resolution lies at the

**Political Level (referred to as the Great Strategy or the General**
Strategy), which is controlled by the National Government. At this
level the Chief of the Defence Staff acts as an advisor regarding the
possibilities of a military response in situations that might require the
use of the Armed Forces.

The Chief of the Defence Staff is situated at the lower, Strategic
**Level (or Military Strategy level), and guides strategy under the**
leadership of the President of the Government and the Ministry of
Defence, with the advice of the Service Chiefs of Staff. At this level
the political objectives determined by the Government become
strategic objectives, which are then transmitted by a strategic
directive sent by the Chief of the Defence Staff to the operational
commands.

The Chief of the Defence Staff heads the planning, strategic
development and **command of operations (the operational**
direction), which is then normally delegated to a directly subordinate
authority that acts at the Operational Level.


-----

Presently the Chief of the Defence Staff is the Commander of
the Joint Operational Command, assuming the operational
command of land, naval and air forces assigned to carry out
operational missions, and may also be involved in the strategic
development of the operations.

The Chief of the Defence Staff’s role at a strategic level involves:

-  Acting as the Government’s military advisor.

-  Acting as the military authority in charge of transforming the
political decisions received from the Minister into **directives**
that order and direct the actions of the Armed Forces in
operational missions. Responsibilities include general
planning, establishing the required operational organisation,
determining the forces to be assigned to the operational plans
and transferring authority to the national or allied commands
who will ultimately make use of it.

Along with these functions in the area of operations, are
others derived from simultaneous actions at the **operational**
**level, which is the most obvious arena for carrying out Joint**
Action. This requires highly detailed, dedicated planning and
direction of military operations involving our Armed Forces; that
is the projection, sustainment and redeployment (i.e. the
participation) of Spanish forces in operations that fall under
Allied command.

In order to adequately meet responsibilities at both the strategic
and operational levels, the Chief of the Defence Staff needs an
authority upon whom to delegate the management of the operations,
which include the ones that presently are carried out by the Service
Chiefs of Staff.


-----

In order to develop this, the operational structure of the Armed
Forces is composed of a permanent section (Chief of the Defence
Staff/Operational Command with its Staff) and other subordinate
sections that may be established by the assignment of forces.

The Chief of the Defence Staff will have a Headquarters that
includes:

-  An **Operations Command with its corresponding**

operational Staff.

-  A **Staff** to provide support in defining and developing the
Military Strategy, and in the other responsibilities.

The **Chief of the Operations Command will conduct the**
necessary operations, delegated by the Chief of the Defence Staff, in
order to fulfil the operational missions in times of peace, crisis, war
or armed conflict.

In addition to conducting operations delegated by the Chief of
the Defence Staff, the Chief of the Operations Command will have
the following specific responsibilities:

-  Operational planning.

-  Monitoring operations when Spanish forces are involved.

-  Planning and conducting the necessary evaluations of active
operational plans and joint and combined training.

-  Monitoring the level of training and operational effectiveness
of the Services Forces.

At present the three Service Chiefs of Staff are responsible for

**permanent specific missions in times of peace. Missions related to**


-----

the exercise of sovereignty will now fall under the authority of the
Chief of the Defence Staff, who will generally delegate their
execution to specific Commands.

The three Service Chiefs of Staff are responsible for the

**designation of any Service forces to be assigned by the Chief of the**
Defence Staff to a specific plan. Once designated, coordination with
the specific Commands of these forces can be undertaken by the
Chief of Operations.

The Chief of the Defence Staff, advised by the Service Chiefs of
Staff, will issue the general guidelines for preparing the Forces for
operational involvement, in accord with the plans and missions to be
carried out.


-----

**TH**
### 6 BASIC CRITERION

**“There will be a ‘Joint Rapid Reaction Force’ established upon**
**the basis of a ‘pool’ of forces.”**

**Rapid Reaction Forces can be defined as a set of units that are**
prepared for rapid deployment.

In the present strategic scenario, Reaction Forces, due to their
higher level of readiness and availability, are most likely to supply the
necessary instruments for acting in peace-support and crisis control
operations, and in the initial phases of a larger conflict.

From a doctrinal and conceptual point of view, it is clearly
desirable to have a Joint Rapid Reaction Force built upon a set of
**land, naval and air units prepared for rapid deployment, enabling**
the Government to react quickly in any crisis.

Along with those already mentioned, other common
characteristics of the Reaction Forces are great strategic mobility,
flexibility and combat power as well as a capability for sustained
action in accord with the type of mission they are to carry out. Rapid
deployment depends on their readiness for action and this in turn
depends on a consistently high level of training, maintenance of
material effectiveness and continual availability of the necessary
levels of supplies.

These forces must be configured to allow their deployment and
sustainment in accord with their specific operational contingency
plans, in order to meet the operational requirements for carrying out,


-----

up to an intermediate level of effort, national or multinational
operations under the auspices of NATO, the EU, the UN, the
OSCE or ad hoc coalitions.

Given the foreseeable strategic scenario, the present Spanish
Armed Forces capabilities, and the fact that in most operations we
would act within the Atlantic Alliance or European Union
framework, it is not considered necessary or convenient to have a
**permanent Joint Rapid Reaction Force. This should not be seen as**
a move to relinquish real reaction capability and effective forces
projection.

The use of the “Joint Rapid Reaction Force” concept does not
**imply creating a new organic structure. It simply means that a set**
of truly deployable, flexible and highly available forces with strike
capability should be at the disposal of the Armed Forces Operational
Command, constituting a package of capabilities for joint planning
and training purposes.

Developing this concept will require procedures, use of the
permanent structure for operational execution, and the existence of
a highly available set of forces. The three Service Chiefs of Staff
exercise the organic command and are responsible for the formation,
specific ongoing training and the state of availability required by
**the forces in this pool. When the Chief of the Defence Staff orders**
that certain forces from this pool are to be at the disposal of the
Armed Forces Operational Command for a specific operation, the
Service Chiefs of Staff will transfer the authority to that
Commander.

In any case, this pool will be configured according to the existing

**Operational Plans that are continuously updated by the Joint**
Headquarters.


-----

### 7[TH] BASIC CRITERION

**“The Service Chiefs of Staff will carry out the Organic**
**Command of their Service, without exercising the Operational**
**Command.”**

Activities on the operational level resulting from the execution of
the Armed Forces missions defined in the conceptual phase of this
Strategic Review are essentially of a joint or combined nature.

In addition, the **missions that the Armed Forces carry out**

**permanently in times of peace and that affect sovereignty need to be**
integrated and controlled by one single operational structure, to
better profit from the information and capabilities supplied by each
Service.

This confirms the need for a joint operational command for
planning, control, execution and monitoring of operations. It also
implies that the Service Chiefs of Staff relinquish responsibility for
the operational missions that are currently assigned to them; in other
words, that they cease to be Operational Commands.

According to this, the current configuration of Land, Naval and
Air Operational Commands (MOT, MON and MOA, respectively)
will disappear, and their structures and resources may become part of
the Joint Headquarters.

The Service Chiefs of Staff will have the Organic Command

of their Services, responsible for the technical, tactical and logistical
preparation of their Services. Among other things, this includes


-----

technical doctrine and education, as well as Force organisation and
training, in order to guarantee that the forces are generated whenever
the Chief of the Defence Staff orders certain units to be moved to his
Operational Command.

For this purpose the Service Chiefs of Staff will have a Staff
within their headquarters to assist in exercising the Organic
Command.


-----

### 8[TH] BASIC CRITERION

**“A functional structure will be established for the Services.”**

In the Ministry of Defence, several projects were carried out in
tandem with the Strategic Review process for restructuring the
**traditional territorial organisation of the Services. The objective**
behind these projects was to empower the operational capability of
each Service, increase the flexibility of Force support and promote
joint action.

The organisation of the Services will be structured according to
the **following three areas: Command assistance, the Force, and**
Force support.

As a consequence of this new **functional organisation, the**
territorial organisation of the Services will disappear at all levels.
Functional organs of the three Services will assume functions which
were essentially logistical and administrative in nature, formerly
exercised by the military, maritime or aerial Regions, Zones,
Command Headquarters, Sectors, etc. The administrative functions
just mentioned will be transferred to the Defence Head Offices.
However, the unique location and characteristics of the Balearic and
Canary Islands as well as the cities of Ceuta and Melilla require a
singular and separate treatment.

Based on these principles, a corresponding Royal Decree was
developed in order to introduce the reforms necessary for a future
**new Law on Basic Criteria for Defence, to update the principles**
that inspired the present legal framework.


-----

We are fully aware that this entire functional reform must be
compatible with the need to maintain a **military presence**
**throughout the national territory, and for this purpose appropriate**
decisions have been made. Therefore, certain functional Commands
will assume these representative tasks, which until now have been
carried out by each Services’ Territorial Commands.


-----

**TH**
### 9 BASIC CRITERION

**“Human resources constitute the key element in Defence.**
**Therefore, the necessary actions must be carried out to achieve a**
**sufficient number of highly motivated and prepared personnel.”**

In this profession with a clear vocational nature, prioritising
**human resources as a guarantee ensuring Armed Forces effectiveness**
requires **military personnel with professional qualities compatible**
with the demands of the missions to be carried out. Quality shall be
achieved by an adequate **selection process adjusted to the**
commitments to be developed, with integral and rigorous training
and permanent motivation that fosters a willingness to assume the
risks inherent to this profession.

**Civil personnel that provide services to Defence should be**
valued along similar lines and will therefore be selected, prepared and
motivated so as to effectively fulfil their responsibilities.

To reach these objectives and progress towards **full**
**professionalisation, all aspects of military personnel careers will be**
**programmed. Areas to be developed are recruiting, solid military**
**education and training, and possible job placement in the labour**
market after leaving the service. Areas to be improved include
**quality of life and social action. A possible reform of the present**
**Branches and Rank level structure, and of military posts, will be**
considered.

In order to optimise **military personnel performance and**
dedication to their specific professional responsibilities, they will be


-----

liberated from those tasks that can be effectively carried out by
specialised companies through outsourcing.

**Permanent personnel should always be adjusted to the needs of**
the Armed Forces, according to the missions and the level of
ambition determined by the Government. The maximum number of
soldiers, sailors and marines will be set annually in the Law on the
**State’s General Budget, taking into account not only available**
resources but also international conditions and internal sociological
variables. The dimensions will be set in accord with the criteria
mentioned and determined **periodically as approved personnel**
**figures, for officers and for soldiers, sailors and marines.**

The concept of reserves included in the Law will be developed
to establish a procedure for obtaining the necessary numbers to meet
the demands of the moment. Specifically, volunteer reserves will be
developed **in cooperation with other Public Administrations,**
allowing for greater interconnection between Society and the Armed
Forces while providing additional resources in a manner that is
**gradual and proportional to the demands of a conflict situation.**

Spanish and allied experience in the past, the foreseeable trends
in the Armed Forces environment, its full professionalisation, and
the expected improvements in soldier, sailor and marine personnel
quality, indicate that the rate of cadre, the ratio between the number
of active officers and troops, will tend to move towards the figure
of 50%.

**TH**
### 10 BASIC CRITERION

**“The logistical integration of Defence will be fully pursued.”**

As top authority in charge of developing the Policy on
Armament and Materiel, Infrastructure and Telecommunications
Systems, the Secretary of State for Defence will accomplish this using
the **criterion of “centralised direction and decentralised**
**execution”.**

This **“decentralised execution” criterion will be carried out**
through the present **Headquarters’** **Commands, who are**

**responsible for the execution of the policies mentioned, under the**
**Secretary of State’s direction.**

The Force, its needs and Logistical Support of the Force, will be
determined at the highest level in the context of the Military
Defence Planning Process. **The Chief of the Defence Staff is**
**ultimately responsible for determining needs and operational**
**priorities, and the Secretary of State for Defence’s responsibility**
**is to determine the financial, industrial and technological**
**framework for meeting these needs. These activities will be carried**
**out in tandem throughout the entire planning process with the**
objective of optimising joint action capabilities.

In order to rationalise the Logistical Process of acquisition and
support during the life cycle of weapons, infrastructures, and
information and telecommunications systems, the following general
principles will be applied:


-----

**- Handling the Logistical Process in four distinct phases:**
planning, programming, budgeting and execution. This last
phase includes procurement, logistical support during the life
cycle and disposal.

**- Expanding the time frame for planning in order to examine**
**the Armed Forces’ long-term needs (up to 20-25 years) so as**
to guide the use of available resources and investments in R+D
while allowing Industry to prepare for future programmes.

**- Applying the principle of joint action to logistical**
**organisation, process and procedures, only allowing**
technically necessary distinctions between its components (the
three Services, the Defence Staff and the Central Organ).

**- Organising the logistical activity of the Armed Forces so**
**that the Ministry of Defence is identified as a “single**

the position of Commissioner for the CIS Management Plan, the
Secretariat of State will **study the possible creation of the**
**following new organisations:**

**- A Management Office or similar organism for obtaining**
**the Principal Programmes, dependent on the Directorate**
General for Armament and Materiel (DGAM), to standardise
procedures, optimise resources and adequately programme the
operational phase of the life cycle.

**- A Management Office or similar organism for**
**maintenance, dependent on the DGAM, to standardise**
procedures, optimise resources and supervise and control the
industrial maintenance of the Armed Forces and of

### 11[TH] BASIC CRITERION

**“To advance toward maximum interoperability with European**
**partners and allies.”**

Along with compatibility, the capacity to interchange and use
common doctrines, procedures or equipment, interoperability
constitutes one level of standardisation and is closely linked to the
former.

The goal of standardisation is to increase operational efficiency
and performance in the use of available resources. Improvements in
this area should be considered a key element of Defence planning.

**Interoperability is understood as the Armed Forces’ capacity to**
train, drill, and then operate effectively in carrying out the joint and
combined missions assigned.

Common doctrine and procedures, interoperability of
communications, information systems and related equipment, and
the interchangeability of combat supplies are necessary to attain
**interoperable multinational forces.**

Operational interoperability directly influences the combat
effectiveness of allied forces, especially those that participate in
multinational formations. The standardisation of equipment,
supplies and procedures is clearly a global force multiplier that must
be considered when **designing and producing systems and**
**equipment. The minimum objectives for achieving this combat**
effectiveness are interoperability of main equipment,


-----

interchangeability of supplies and the use of common procedures.
These requirements are directly related to logistical support for
standardised equipment.

The importance of interoperability has increased over the last
decade. It is the basic tool for achieving the **two main objectives**
that European countries should pursue: to be able to operate
effectively with the United States and with each other, and to have
the capabilities to act in operations within the framework of the
**Atlantic Alliance or the European Union.**

The European countries should acknowledge their limitations
and accept this new reality, focussing their efforts on increasing and
**improving interoperability in order to reduce as much as possible**
the effects of the indisputable **technological gap with the United**
States. The answer does not lie simply in increasing investment, but
also in improving its effectiveness. For example, the **European**
**Capability Action Plan (ECAP), carried out by the** **European**
**Union in order to overcome the present shortfalls, should be**
concurrent with the Defence Capabilities Initiative (DCI), which
is presently under review through the Alliance’s Prague Capabilities
**Commitment (PCC). It is important that the two initiatives be**
complimentary, reducing costs by avoiding unnecessary overlapping
and duplication.

One of the main objectives of the European countries, both
through the **Defence Capabilities Initiative and the** **Prague**
**Capabilities Commitment as well as the** **European Union**
**Capability Action Plan must be to** **reach a certain degree of**
**interoperability, especially in Command and Control and**
Information systems, allowing the European nations to operate
jointly and with other partners or allies such as the United
States.


-----

The lack of resources is undoubtedly a problem in this area, and
requires a redoubling of efforts. Each of the nations must make a
greater commitment of resources, even though this will not solve the
entire problem. Better use of these resources is also important and is
achieved by fostering alternatives that enable greater cooperation in
multinational projects, shared resources and capabilities, greater
specialisation, and greater concurrence of processes such as the
European Union Capability Action Plan. These help to avoid
duplicating efforts, thus favouring **interoperability** and

**standardisation.**

### 12[TH] BASIC CRITERION

**“The Land Forces must have the greatest projection,**
**deployment, tactical mobility and strike capabilities.”**

The Army will maintain its criterion of being organised,
equipped and trained for use in the entire spectrum of the conflict,
in order to contribute decisively in the management of national or
international crises of diverse nature or intensity.

The Land Forces must combine adequately protected light units
with others that have adequate strike capability.

Although the **armoured and mechanised forces still provide**
the greatest strike capability in Surface Manoeuvres and continue to
be the main factor in deterrence and superiority, progress must be
made towards a Land Force with significant projection capability.

So in addition to light forces with a sufficient degree of
protection, there is also a need for intermediate forces. While these
forces will not have the combat power of the armoured/mechanised
units, they have sufficient strike and rapid reaction (projectability)
capability. In addition to rapid location on the scene of the crisis, this
would permit crisis control when the need is not for decisive force
but for superiority from the outset.

Therefore, to be ready to respond to any potential crisis,

**tomorrow’s Land Forces must include protected light units,**
**armoured/mechanised units and intermediate units with light**
**armoured/mechanised capabilities. Light units should be**


-----

sufficiently protected and armoured/mechanised units should be as
light as possible through state-of–the–art technology to facilitate
their transport while maintaining sufficient power, protection and
strike capability.

Along with Surface Manoeuvre, Airmobile Manoeuvre must be
empowered as a fundamental element of Land Manoeuvre, to
increase mobility and the reach of military action during Land
Manoeuvre. For this purpose the appropriate airmobile platforms
are required.

### 13[TH] BASIC CRITERION

**“Naval Forces, while maintaining their capacity for controlling**
**the maritime spaces that are under our national sovereignty and**
**within our interests, must be oriented towards operations in far-**
**off littoral theatres, placing special emphasis on the projection of**
**Naval power over land.”**

Since World War II and particularly after the fragmentation of
the USSR, Western navies have gradually moved away from great
oceanic naval operations, downsizing their naval forces to
concentrate their capabilities on the littoral operational
environment.

At a time when projection needs are in the spotlight, it is
important to emphasize that naval forces are particularly equipped
for this type of operations.

Their **capability for self-sustainment, not requiring the**
support of a host nation, their **strategic mobility** and their
**enormous flexibility, make them invaluable in allowing precise and**
quick intervention in any crisis.

The very presence of an amphibious force has a deterring effect,
obliging the enemy to carry out defensive deployment and
distracting a disproportionate number of forces.

Therefore it is important to acquire a **greater capability for**
**naval power projection over land, a fundamental capability that**
the Navy can contribute to joint and combined strategy. The


-----

capability for action in maritime spaces of sovereignty and interest
must also be empowered, especially in the areas of maritime
surveillance and strategic transport and projection capabilities.


-----

### 14[TH] BASIC CRITERION

**“The Air Force must have all-weather, day/night combat**
**capability, greater transport capability and greater reach and**
**precision.”**

The lessons learned in recent armed conflicts demonstrate the
necessity to achieve and maintain air superiority as a pre-requisite
for initiating a military campaign.

In order to carry out aerial operations against the enemy’s air
power and potential, as well as against political, industrial, economic
and military power centres, or in support of one’s own surface forces,
**offensive aerial means are necessary based on combat platforms**
with day/night, all-weather operating capability. Air weapons
systems must be equipped with remote-launched intelligent
**weapons so as to operate with an acceptable degree of security and**
precision, while reducing collateral damage whenever stipulated.

In addition, since air attacks are one of the greatest threats to the
security of a nation and its combat forces, an effective air defence
**system must be in place and operational at all times.**

Aerial operations not only require the availability of combat
units but also the **transport means necessary to support an**
advanced deployment. Both capabilities should be developed
simultaneously. Air transport is one of the pillars of the strategic
mobility of rapid action forces. Their necessary empowerment
should include air transport means, given that the Armed Forces will
probably act in far-off places and over undefined periods of time.


-----

The reach of these **air weapons systems** is critical, especially
since the weapons load determines the distance it can be transported
or vice versa, the distance to its objective limits the platforms’
firepower. Reach is also an essential aspect of deployment in far-off
theatres. Therefore it is indispensable to increase the capability for
**in-flight refuelling, which acts as a force multiplier when there are**
a sufficient number of refuelling units and they have adequate fuel
transfer capability.
