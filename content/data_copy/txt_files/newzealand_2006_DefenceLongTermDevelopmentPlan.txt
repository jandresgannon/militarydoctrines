## Preface by the Minister of Defence

I am pleased to release this third update of the Defence Long-Term
_Development Plan (LTDP). It reaffirms the Government’s ongoing_
commitment to rebuilding and re-equipping the New Zealand Defence
Force (NZDF) as a combat capable force.  Photo of Hon Phil Goff, Minister of Defence.

First released in 2002, the LTDP is the Government’s blueprint for
equipping the NZDF. The LTDP enables decisions on defence
acquisitions to be prioritised and taken in the context of the
Government’s defence policy, and project affordability.

This updated LTDP takes account of decisions made since the last update in November
2004. It also looks to the future and the evolving needs of the NZDF.

Key features of this update are:

- reporting on the significant progress made in acquiring: the Navy’s Project Protector
ships, Army vehicles and weapons, and the upgrade or replacement of all the Air
Force’s aircraft;

- the listing of seven new projects ranging from infrastructure investment to examining
the merit of satellite communications;

- more realistic acquisition estimates by including such factors like estimated inflation;
and

- the inclusion for the first time of the estimated through life costs of the capability.

With the commitment of $771 million for the purchase of medium utility helicopters all the
priority projects listed in the first LTDP as “Projects Necessary to Avoid the Failure of
Policy” have now been progressed to contract. A significant amount of the initial funding
committed by the Government in the 2001 Defence Statement is now accounted for.

With careful management of the LTDP to ensure the overall plan remains affordable, the
remaining funding - about $1 billion - will fund projects which are a priority over the next
five years. These include the consolidation of Air Force operational activities at Ohakea,
completing the ANZAC frigate systems upgrade, continuing the renewal of the Army’s
transport fleet, and introducing modern communications systems into the NZDF.

Hon Phil Goff
Minister of Defence

## 1. Introduction 

1.1 First released on 11 June 2002, and updated in 2003 and 2004, the ‘Defence
Long-Term Development Plan' (LTDP) is a key capital planning tool to enable
decisions on defence acquisitions to be taken in the context of the Government's
defence policy, the priority of projects and affordability. The LTDP links the
Government's defence policy objectives, which were set out in the Defence Policy
Framework released in June 2000, with the capability requirements announced in
the Defence Statement of 8 May 2001. This LTDP contains a comprehensive list
of projects, with preliminary costing, timings, and priorities. The LTDP has a
rolling forward focus over 10 years and was constructed as an active document,
to be updated regularly. This is the third update of the plan.

1.2 The LTDP:

a) describes major acquisition projects required to provide military capabilities
that meet the Government's defence policy objectives;

b) reflects relative priorities of the projects, measured against the Government's
defence policy and security needs and interests;

c) works within agreed financial limitations; and

d) sets out planning and decision-making processes incorporating management
of both operational and financial risks to ensure that investment in defence
provides the best value for money.

### Funding Parameters

1.3 The LTDP is managed within approved financial parameters. These are:

a) up to $1.3 billion, in nominal terms, in capital injections over 10 years
commencing in 2002; (and including the additional funding provided in the
Defence Sustainability Initiative Package in 2005);

b) any inflationary pressure to be managed within these constraints until
2005/06; and

c) leasing options may be considered where there is a fiscally neutral trade-off
between capital and operating expenditure.

1.4 Funding amounts in the LTDP are the capital cost of bringing the asset into
service and exclude GST. They do not include operating costs such as
depreciation, personnel, maintenance, and consumables.

### Project Summary Sheets

1.5 A project summary sheet has been prepared for these projects in sections 5 to 9
of the LTDP. Each summary sheet describes the project, how it contributes to the
Government's defence policy, links to other capabilities, timing issues, costs and
possible options where these are known. Options and trade-offs for defence
acquisitions are properly investigated, costed and presented to Ministers as
projects are brought forward for approval.


-----

## 2. The Long-Term Development Plan and Defence Policy

2.1 The LTDP sets out the defence acquisition projects that will enable the New
Zealand Defence Force (NZDF) to implement the Government's defence policy
objectives.

2.1 In its 8 May 2001 Defence Statement, the Government stated that it is :

"building a modern, professional and well-equipped Defence Force with the
necessary military capabilities across all three services to meet New Zealand's
objectives... the New Zealand Defence Force is being reconfigured so that it is
sustainable and affordable over the long-term. It will be able both to meet New
Zealand's own defence and security needs, and to make a useful contribution
when it is deployed."[1]

2.2 The Government's defence policy objectives are:

    - to defend New Zealand and to protect its people, land, territorial waters, EEZ,
natural resources and critical infrastructure;

    - to meet our alliance commitments to Australia by maintaining a close defence
partnership in pursuit of common security interests;

    - to assist in the maintenance of security in the South Pacific and to provide
assistance to our Pacific neighbours;

    - to play an appropriate role in the maintenance of security in the Asia-Pacific
region, including meeting our obligations as a member of the FPDA; and

    - to contribute to global security and peacekeeping through participation in the
full range of UN and other appropriate multilateral peace support and
humanitarian relief operations.[2]

## 3. Funding

### Funding Guidelines

3.1 Following a review of the financial effects caused by revaluation of the NZDF's
assets on the LTDP (CAB Min (03) 11/4), the Government directed the following
financial parameters:

a) up to $1 billion, in nominal terms, in capital injections over 10 years
commencing 2002;

b) any inflationary pressure to be managed within these constraints until
2005/06;

c) leasing options may be considered where there is a neutral trade-off between
capital and operating expenditure.

3.2 Since then additional funding from the Defence Sustainability Initiative (DSI) and
the proceeds from the sales of defence assets has been added to the
Government's investment in defence capital. This has resulted in $1.3 billion now
being available in the form of capital injections.


-----

### Affordability, Options and Trade-Offs

3.3 Funding constraints, cash flow management (both from depreciation and new
capital) and defence industry considerations will also affect priorities, timing and
the overall affordability of the LTDP. Trade-offs within and between projects are
necessary. The projects presented in the LTDP take into account the
Government's existing funding parameters. Solutions have been developed to
provide capabilities within the financial parameters that are appropriate for New
Zealand's circumstances and will deliver the Government's policy. For most
projects, however, accurate costing information cannot be determined until tender
responses are received. It is acknowledged that in order to determine the
affordability of the LTDP, Defence needs to continue to improve the individual
costing data on which the plan is based, on a project-by-project basis.

3.4 In order to provide more robust decision-making information the costing options
for acquisition projects are modelled through the Defence Resource Allocation
Model (DRAM). This modelling considers all elements of defence capital
expenditure, including acquisition costs, through-life costs and cost/risk mitigation
as they become available. The model is regularly updated when projects are
integrated into the plan, accurate costs become available or when depreciation
funding changes due to asset revaluations. Life cycle costing policy is being
developed and through-life costs are being obtained for projects currently at the
acquisition phase.

3.5 A first effort at integrating life cycle costing into the LTDP has now been made in
this latest update. For the majority of projects on the LTDP, life cycle costing
models have been developed that capture the ongoing annual personnel and
operating costs as well as any mid-life upgrades. These models are based on
projected costs adjusted for domestic and military inflation as well as the impact of
expected movements in foreign exchange. The result is that estimated costs now
include the estimated life, the total operating costs through that life and therefore
the total cost of ownership.


-----

3.6 By changing the model to examine different levels of capability, cost and policy
compliance it is possible to identify options within projects. These options, which
can be investigated for each project, could include phasing projects to spread the
cash flow or reducing the size and/or scope of a project. Reducing the level of
capability acquired could affect the NZDF's ability to deliver outputs designed to
achieve the Government's policy objectives. NZDF and Treasury officials are
continuing to work on strategies to minimise financial risks.

### Financial Risks

3.7 There are several financial risks associated with the LTDP that will have to be
managed to ensure the plan remains affordable.

a) **Inflation. Estimated costs of projects reflect the impact of military inflation,**
and, where appropriate, internal and construction price indexation.

b) **Foreign Exchange Movements. The majority of the project costs included**
in the revised LTDP have been converted from USD into NZD using
exchange rate projections advised by Treasury (below). Any change to these
projections will result in changes to project costs.

**FY 06/07** **FY 07/08** **FY 08/09 Onwards**

0.62 0.57 0.55

c) **Upgrades. Military equipment requires regular upgrades to ensure that it is**
able to provide the required capability. Upgrades are also important to keep
pace with technological changes and to maintain interoperability with other
defence forces. Known upgrades have been included in the LTDP. Other
unpredicted upgrades may be required during the life of the equipment.

d) **Personnel and Operating Costs. Operating baseline changes will need to**
be managed to take account of pay increases and changes in NZDF
personnel numbers, training requirements, maintenance and operations costs
resulting from new equipment.

e) **Asset Revaluations. The majority of procurement funding is derived from**
depreciation of the current defence asset base, much of which is purchased
in USD. Recent changes to NZ Financial Reporting Standards dictate that all
assets are to be revaluated annually, with a consequential impact on the
funding arising from depreciation. Should the depreciation funding be greater
than that forecast during the Defence Funding Package (DFP), the NZDF is
able to seek this additional funding from the Government up to and including
2009/10. After this date, the risk of funding depreciation flows greater than
that allowed in the DFP is a risk to the NZDF.

3.8 This LTDP was based on a bottom-up assessment of Defence capability
requirements in relation to policy objectives. These have been rated in order of
priority, and funding was planned accordingly. There is a natural tendency for
projects in later years to be less critical in meeting current policy, but these
relative assessments will change with time and circumstances. Those changes
will be reflected in future iterations of this document. In this current plan, projects
have been funded first on the basis of criticality to policy and remaining funds
have been applied to some lower priority projects that had time imperatives
associated with platform upgrades.

## 4. Managing the LTDP

4.1 Several processes have been developed to ensure that the LTDP will be a core
decision-making tool for the Government.

### Updating the LTDP

4.2 It is important that the LTDP is updated regularly to provide the best information
possible to inform decisions on defence acquisitions and the budget cycle. The
following processes will, therefore, be a feature of managing the LTDP:

a) An updated LTDP and accompanying report from officials will be submitted to
Ministers to inform their considerations during the strategic phase of the
budget process.

b) The LTDP will be treated as a dynamic, evolutionary document and updated
on a regular basis as warranted by the availability of new and more accurate
information.

c) The LTDP will be updated whenever there is a significant change in the
Government's financial circumstances, a change in policy, or to support the
financial impact of NZDF asset revaluations.

d) An updated LTDP will be made available whenever acquisition proposals are
submitted for government consideration and approval. This will permit
Ministers to consider each project within the overall context of total planned
acquisitions and with a clear view of priorities, risks and trade-offs.

4.3 It is also important that Ministers have confidence that projects are well managed
and that acquisition activity is consistent with the LTDP and government direction.
This is achieved by the use of the following processes by the Ministry of Defence
and the NZDF:

a) Government approval is sought to proceed with acquisition activity for each
project.

b) The Minister of Defence is consulted before commencing major project
definition studies.

c) The Minister of Defence is consulted before documentation being made
available to commercial suppliers.

d) The Minister of Defence is advised of the outcome of the evaluation of the
responses from commercial suppliers.

e) The Minister of Defence is consulted before documentation is made available
to short-listed suppliers, and on the criteria to be used for evaluating the
responses.

f) The Minister of Defence is advised of the outcome of the tender evaluation,
including an analysis of the ability of the equipment to be acquired to meet
the capability, and on contract negotiations with the preferred supplier(s).

g) On completion of the contract negotiations, Ministerial approval is sought to
enter into contract with the preferred supplier(s) and for the appropriation of
funds.


-----

### Capability Management Framework

4.4 Defence has developed a Capability Management Framework setting out
governance arrangements and procedures to provide a robust and sustainable
basis for the NZDF and the Ministry of Defence to progress capability
development and implementation. The Framework ensures that the projects on
the LTDP are defined, costed and presented to Ministers in a timely manner. The
Framework also allows HQ NZDF, single Services, and the Ministry of Defence to
plan for, and allocate appropriate resources to, those projects that have a higher
priority on the LTDP.

### Defence Sustainability Initiative

4.5 In December 2003 the Government initiated a review to identify both current and
optimum configuration and resource requirements for the defence organisation to
undertake the roles and tasks set out in the Government's statements of defence
policy and in the LTDP. The resulting Defence Capability and Resourcing Review
was presented to Ministers in February 2005. It confirmed that operational and
organisational capabilities in a number of areas of the NZDF and Ministry of
Defence were below what is required by government policy. This led to the May
2005 Defence Sustainability Initiative (DSI). This policy statement outlined a
major remedial programme and a firm commitment of increased resources over
the next 10 years to achieve long-term sustainability for Defence. It saw
additional funding being provided (excluding GST) of $4.6 billion (operating) and
$209 million (capital) over the next 10 years.

## 5. Projects Approved and in Acquisition Phase

### Boeing 727 Replacement / Boeing 757 Modification Photo of a Royal New Zealand Air Force Boeing 757.

_A Royal New Zealand Air Force Boeing 757_

##### Description

5.1 This project replaced the Boeing 727 aircraft with Boeing 757 aircraft with greater
range and payload capacity. A modification programme, including freight
capability, engine enhancements and upgraded communications and navigation
equipment, will configure the aircraft to meet the strategic airlift capability required
by the NZDF.

##### Policy Value

5.2 In addition to the C-130s, New Zealand requires a strategic airlift capability
provided by jet transport aircraft. This was previously provided by two Boeing 727
aircraft and is now provided by the Boeing 757 aircraft. Strategic airlift is an
enabler for the same roles and tasks as the C-130, particularly the deployment
and sustainment of NZDF forces on overseas deployments and the evacuation of
New Zealand citizens.

##### Capability Gaps

5.3 An effective air transport capability is a critical enabler for many operations and
has a high degree of utility across all of the Government's defence policy
objectives. The capability provides essential air transport for the deployment of
NZDF personnel and equipment within New Zealand, to the South Pacific,
Australia, the Asia-Pacific region and globally.


-----

5.4 In order to best meet both strategic and tactical aircraft requirements, and meet
the Government's policy requirements, two Boeing 757 aircraft in a combination
freight/passenger configuration are required.

##### Links to other Capabilities

5.5 This project has links to the following projects and capabilities:

    - C-130 Life Extension

##### Timing

5.6 The project is expected to be completed in 2008.

##### Current Status

5.7 The two Boeing 757 aircraft, purchased in a passenger configuration, have been
in service since mid-2003. Modifications necessary to meet the full capability
requirements will begin in the first quarter of 2007.

##### Costs

5.8 Acquiring and modifying the Boeing 757 aircraft is expected to cost about $220
million.

### Medium Range Anti-Armour Weapon Photo of a US Soldier demonstrating the Javelin system New Zealand has acquired.

_US Soldier demonstrates the Javelin system New Zealand has acquired_

##### Description

5.9 This project will provide protection for New Zealand's land forces from armoured
threats.

##### Policy Value

5.10 The Medium Range Anti-Armour Weapon (MRAAW) provides land forces with a
medium-range capability against armoured vehicles and other targets. It is a
critical part of any contribution to peace enforcement operations where land
forces may face an armoured vehicle threat. The MRAAW also has some utility in
peacekeeping operations in the Asia-Pacific region and globally for self-protection
in the event of an escalation in the threat to ground forces.

##### Capability Gap

5.11 New Zealand land forces are currently very vulnerable to threats from tanks,
armoured vehicles or other anti-armour weapons. There is a need for a capability
to engage these threats at the greatest distance practicable.

5.12 The Army currently has a short-range anti-armour weapon. It is, however, limited
in range and lethality. A medium-range anti-armour weapon is required to defeat
threats at a greater range than the current weapon.

##### Links to other Capabilities

5.13 This project has links to the following projects and capabilities:

    - Light Armoured Vehicle

    - Light Operational Vehicle

    - Direct Fire Support Weapon - Area (Automatic Grenade Launchers)


-----

    - Land Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance

##### Timing

5.14 Delivery commenced mid-2006, for completion by December 2006.

##### Current Status

5.15 This project has been undertaken through the United States Foreign Military Sales
(FMS) programme and involves the purchase of Javelin missiles and associated
support equipment.

##### Costs

5.16 This project is expected to cost $24 million. The estimated life is 15 years, in
service through life costs are $21 million, and the total cost of ownership is $43
million.


-----

### Very Low Level Air Defence Cueing System

##### Description

5.17 This project involves the purchase of additional equipment to bring the Mistral air
defence system up to operational standard.

##### Policy Value

5.18 An air defence capability is necessary to protect critical land force elements from
air threats such as low flying aircraft and armed helicopters.

##### Capability Gap

5.19 The current system has not been fully operational. Target detection, identification
and tracking rely on visual observation. To be fully effective and minimise risk to
friendly aircraft, the system requires an auto cueing and identification friend or foe
(IFF) capability.

##### Links to other Capabilities

5.20 This project has links to the following projects and capabilities:

    - Light Armoured Vehicles

    - Light Operational Vehicles

    - Direct Fire Support Weapon

    - Land Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance

##### Timing

5.21 Delivery has taken place and training will be complete by December 2006.

##### Current Status

5.22 New Zealand has contracted a Spanish company, Indra, for the supply of the IFF
equipment.

##### Costs

5.23 This project is expected to cost $14 million. The estimated life is 10 years, in
service through life costs are $12 million, and the total cost of ownership is $27
million.

### Light Operational Vehicles Photo of a Pinzgauer General Service Variant.

_Pinzgauer General Service Variant_

##### Description

5.24 This project is providing the Army and Special Forces with a modern, light
operational, military vehicle.

##### Policy Value

5.25 The Light Operational Vehicle (LOV) provides an essential capability to enable the
Army and Special Forces to train and to participate in operations in the South
Pacific, Asia-Pacific region and globally. LOVs are the primary means of transport
used by the Army and Special Forces in peacekeeping operations and also in
peace enforcement operations, including in support of the light armoured vehicle.
In addition, the LOVs may provide support for evacuation operations in the South
Pacific.

##### Capability Gap

5.26 The Army's light transport needs have been met by the Land Rovers. These have
reached the end of their economic life.

##### Links to other Capabilities

5.27 This project has links to the following projects and capabilities:

    - Light Armoured Vehicle

    - Multi-Role Vessel


-----

    - Land Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance

    - Medium Range Anti-Armour Weapon

    - Direct Fire Support Weapon - Area (Automatic Grenade Launchers)

##### Timing

5.28 The project is almost completed.

##### Current Status

5.29 321 (248 non-armoured, 60 armoured, and 13 special operations) Pinzgauer Light
Operational Vehicles were contracted for from Automotive Technik Ltd (ATL) of the
United Kingdom. All but one armoured variant have been delivered. The last one
has remained at ATL for testing and will be delivered in January 2007. The special
operations variants were successfully deployed as part of the third rotation of the
SAS personnel to Afghanistan. The RNZAF has also ordered five LOVs to replace
their communications vehicles, using this project.

##### Costs

5.30 The project is expected to cost about $93 million. The estimated life, in service
through life costs, and the total cost of ownership are to be confirmed.

### Multi-Role Vessel Photo of MRV undergoing seatrials in the North Sea.

_MRV undergoing seatrials in the North Sea_

##### Description

5.31 The Multi-Role Vessel (MRV) will provide
tactical sealift for the NZDF. The MRV's design
also allows for a strategic sealift capability by
way of a port to port capability. The MRV acquisition is part of a larger project,
Project Protector, which also involves the acquisition of two offshore patrol vessels
and four inshore patrol vessels (see page 23). Photo of MRV undergoing seatrials in the North Sea.

##### Policy Value

5.32 The MRV will be used in the South Pacific and Asia-Pacific region for peace
support operations, evacuation of personnel during civil emergencies, and disaster
relief. A tactical sealift capability, to off-load people and equipment without access
to a port facility, will be particularly useful in meeting the Government's policy
objectives in the South Pacific. The MRV will also be able to undertake patrol and
presence operations in New Zealand's EEZ and the South Pacific, and will provide
the Government with an additional option for global deployments (or allow the
ANZAC frigates to be deployed for global tasks). The MRV will provide additional
berths for sea training purposes.

##### Capability Gap

5.33 The NZDF has no tactical sealift capability and cannot easily deploy land force
personnel and equipment into areas without port facilities. Tactical sealift vessels
cannot be chartered. Without a MRV, New Zealand will continue to rely on the
tactical sealift capabilities of our allies and friends in the region for deploying to
peace support operations and evacuating our nationals from trouble spots.

5.34 The MRV, in conjunction with the frigates and the offshore patrol vessels, will
provide additional capacity for tasks such as defence diplomacy, support to land
operations, patrol and disaster relief, and for training.


-----

##### Links to other Capabilities

5.35 This project has links to the following projects and capabilities:

    - Offshore and Inshore Patrol Vessels

    - Light Armoured Vehicle

    - Light Operational Vehicle

    - NZDF Helicopter Capability

    - P-3 Mission Systems Upgrade

##### Timing

5.36 Delivery is expected by early 2007.

##### Current Status

5.37 The MRV has been launched and has arrived in Melbourne for final fitting out.

##### Cost

5.38 The cost of the entire Project Protector Fleet is $500 million. The estimated life is
10 - 25 years, in service through life costs are $1.9 billion, and the total cost of
ownership is $2.4 billion.

### Patrol Vessels Photo of an offshore patrol vessel (OPV). Photo of an inshore patrol vessel (IPV).

_Offshore patrol vessel (OPV) and Inshore patrol vessel (IPV)_

##### Description

5.39 This project involves the acquisition of two offshore and four inshore patrol vessels
to meet requirements for maritime surface surveillance in New Zealand's Exclusive
Economic Zone (EEZ) and the South Pacific.

##### Policy Value

5.40 Patrol vessels are an important element in the surveillance of New Zealand's EEZ
and other maritime areas of interest. They work in conjunction with maritime patrol
aircraft to protect our natural resources and detect and deter maritime
transnational threats. Patrol vessels will meet many government agencies' needs,
including the Ministry of Fisheries, the New Zealand Customs Service, the
Department of Conservation, the Police, Maritime New Zealand and others. The
offshore patrol vessels will also be able to support maritime counter-terrorism, and
provide a presence in the South Pacific to support peace and stability and help
with disaster relief.

##### Capability Gap

5.41 New Zealand currently has a very limited maritime surface patrol capability
provided by the two frigates and four inshore patrol craft. There is a need to patrol
the inshore zone around New Zealand. There is also very limited capacity to
undertake counter-terrorism operations at sea.

##### Links to other Capabilities

5.42 This project has links to the following projects and capabilities:

    - Multi-Role Vessel

    - P-3 Mission Systems Upgrade

    - NZDF Helicopter Capability

    - Special Operations Capabilities


-----

##### Timing

5.43 These vessels will be delivered in 2007.

##### Current Status

5.44 Construction of the two offshore and four inshore patrol vessels is underway.

##### Cost

5.45 The cost of the entire Project Protector Fleet is $500 million. The estimated life is
10 - 25 years, in service through life costs are $1.9 billion, and the total cost of
ownership is $2.4 billion.


-----

### Special Operations Capability

##### Description

5.46 This project is providing New Zealands’ Special Forces with equipment to
undertake special operations.

##### Policy Value

5.47 Army special operations capabilities have utility in meeting a range of the
Government's defence policy objectives and also in supporting policing operations
in New Zealand and the South Pacific.

##### Links to Other Capabilities

5.48 This project has links to the following capabilities:

    - Light Operational Vehicle (Special Forces variant)

    - Land Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance

    - NZDF Helicopter Capability

    - C-130 Life Extension

##### Current Status

5.49 The Army is currently purchasing the equipment.

##### Cost

5.50 This equipment will cost around $14 million. The estimated life, in service through
life costs, and the total cost of ownership are to be confirmed.


-----

### Improvised Explosive Device Disposal

##### Description

5.51 This project will enhance the NZDF's Improvised Explosive Device Disposal
(IEDD) capability and develop a credible Improvised Explosive Device Disposal Chemical, Biological and Radiological (IEDD-CBR) capability.

##### Policy Value

5.52 An IEDD and IEDD-CBR capability is part of the NZDF's role to counter any threat
posed by terrorism or acts of sabotage. The NZDF is an essential component of
the wider whole-of-government approach to an IEDD or IEDD-CBR emergency,
which is managed by the New Zealand Police. The potential consequences of
IEDD incidents range from limited, but costly, inconvenience and disruption of
activities through to loss of life if an explosive device was to detonate.

##### Capability Gap

5.53 The existing IEDD capability is derived from the inherent skills of Ammunition
Technical Officers, who have a call out capability but who have limited training for
extreme circumstances and who have had limited equipment. The types of terrorist
threats that now exist require a more deliberate response. There is a high risk of
policy failure without this capability. The ability for New Zealand to host
internationally significant events will be limited unless New Zealand can guarantee
a level of protection against terrorist action.

##### Links to other Capabilities

5.54 This project has links to the following projects and capabilities:

    - Land Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance

    - Army Engineering Equipment

    - Special Operations Capability

##### Current Status

5.55 This project is underway with staff being employed and equipment procured.

##### Cost

5.56 The project will cost around $22 million. The estimated life, in service through life
costs, and the total cost of ownership are to be confirmed.

### P-3 Mission Management, and Communication, and Navigation Systems Upgrades Photo of P-3K Orion flying on a routine monitoring patrol of the New Zealand coast.

_P-3K Orion flying on a routine monitoring patrol of the New Zealand coast_

##### Description

5.57 This project is upgrading the mission management, communications, and
navigation systems required for the P-3 Orion maritime patrol aircraft to conduct
surface surveillance tasks.

##### Policy Value

5.58 The capability provided by the P-3 is central to meeting a broad range of civilian
roles and tasks and for many functions required of the NZDF across the range of
the Government's five defence policy objectives. The P-3 undertakes surveillance
of New Zealand's EEZ and the Southern Ocean, meets our South Pacific search
and rescue obligations, and provides surveillance assistance to South Pacific
nations. The P-3 has a high utility for a wide range of civilian and military
operations. It is one of the primary force elements contributing to our defence
relationships with Australia and Five Power Defence Arrangements (FPDA)
partners.

##### Capability Gap

5.59 The obsolescent systems onboard the P-3 are limiting availability for surveillance
flights and other missions due to repeated equipment failures. Without an
upgrade, there could be policy failure in not meeting the objectives for EEZ and
Southern Ocean surveillance and assisting South Pacific countries with
surveillance of their EEZs. There could also be difficulties in meeting
commitments to Australia and the FPDA.

##### Links to other Capabilities

5.60 This project has links to the following projects and capabilities:

    - Patrol Vessels

    - Multi-Role Vessel

    - Land Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance

    - Joint Command and Control System

    - NZDF Torpedo Replacement

    - P-3 Air-to-Surface Weapons

    - P-3 Self-Protection

    - ANZAC Class upgrades

##### Timing

5.61 In October 2004 a contract was awarded to L-3 Communications Integrated
Systems of the USA as the prime contractor for the project. Design development
continues with the prototype being prepared for the installation of new equipment.

5.62 The first upgraded aircraft is expected to be delivered in 2008, with fleet
modernisation complete in 2010.

##### Current Status

5.63 Upgrade work on the aircraft has commenced.

### C-130 Life Extension Photo of a C-130 Hercules on deployment in Afghanistan.

_C-130 Hercules on deployment in Afghanistan_

##### Description

5.65 This project will extend the life of the C-130 aircraft by upgrading the avionics and
aircraft systems and undertaking some structural refurbishment work.

##### Policy Value

5.66 The C-130 is a critical enabler for many NZDF operations. It provides essential air
transport for the deployment of NZDF personnel and equipment within New
Zealand, to the South Pacific, Australia, the Asia-Pacific region and globally. Air
transport is a critical capability for a number of roles and tasks, including:
supporting counter-terrorist operations; peace support operations; evacuations of
New Zealanders from trouble spots; disaster relief and humanitarian operations;
undertaking tasks within New Zealand; and supporting New Zealand's Antarctic
programme. The C-130 has particular utility where runways are short or in poor
condition.

##### Capability Gaps

5.67 The declining availability of C-130 air transport is a major capability gap that will
increasingly impinge on the NZDF's ability to deploy and support personnel. This
is due to the age of the airframe and systems. There is a risk of policy failure,
particularly in the New Zealand, South Pacific and Asia-Pacific contexts, if this
project is not carried out, as the NZDF would not have sufficient air transport to
support deployments and perform other tasks.

##### Timing

5.69 The first upgraded aircraft is expected to be delivered in 2007, with fleet
modernisation complete in 2010.

##### Current Status

5.70 In December 2004 a contract was awarded to L-3 Communications Spar
Aerospace of Canada as the prime contractor for the project. The prototype aircraft
has been stripped in preparation for the upgrade.

##### Cost

5.71 This project is expected to cost around $234 million. The estimated life, in service
through life costs, and the total cost of ownership are to be confirmed.

### New Defence Headquarters Building Photo of an architectural drawing of the New Defence Headquarters building.

_Architectural drawing of the New Defence Headquarters building_

##### Description

5.72 This project will provide new Wellington accommodation for the Defence
organisations.

##### Policy Value

5.73 The new Defence Building will accommodate the Defence organisations in modern
facilities.

##### Capability Gap

5.74 The lease on the current Defence building will expire in March 2007 and the
Defence organisations are required to relocate.

##### Timing

5.75 The relocation to the new leased accommodation is expected to be completed by
February 2007.

##### Current Status

5.76 The Chief of Defence Force (CDF), on behalf of the Defence organisations, has
negotiated development and lease agreements with Capital Properties Limited, for
the construction of a 18,300m[2] commercial standing office building, modified to
accommodate tenant specific requirements. The Defence organisations are
funding tenant specific requirements for the building and fit out. Construction of the
building is now being completed and soft fit out undertaken.


-----

##### Costs

5.77 The estimated cost to the NZDF of fitting out the new building is $23 million. The
estimated life is 18 years, in service through life costs are $120 million, and the
total cost of ownership is $140 million.


-----

### NZDF Medium Utility Helicopter Capability Photo of a NH90 helicopter.

_NH90 helicopter_

##### Description

5.78 This project will replace the Iroquois utility helicopters with a capability that meets
the NZDF's contemporary needs for a medium utility helicopter.

##### Policy Value

5.79 Utility helicopters provide essential support to the Army, particularly in the South
Pacific and in peace support operations. Helicopters are also important for
supporting police operations in New Zealand and providing a range of support
functions within New Zealand and the South Pacific, such as search and rescue
and disaster relief.

5.80 The introduction into service of the MRV will create an additional role for utility
helicopters in supporting the Army ashore, especially in the South Pacific.

##### Capability Gap

5.81 The Iroquois can no longer provide the capability required by a modern, mobile
land force. These aircraft are becoming increasingly difficult to support because of
their age. With helicopters assuming greater importance for mobility and tasks in
peace support operations, there is a risk that the Army will be unable adequately to
perform its policy roles and tasks if the Iroquois is not upgraded or replaced to
meet current requirements.


-----

##### Links to other Capabilities

5.82 This project has links to the following projects and capabilities:

    - Training/Light Utility Helicopters

    - Special Operations Capabilities

    - Multi-Role Vessel

    - Army Capabilities

##### Timing

5.83 The replacement for the Iroquois is planned for entry into service in 2010 and will
be fully in service by 2013.

##### Current Status

5.84 Cabinet has signed a contract with NH Industries for eight NH90 helicopters as the
replacement for the NZDF's Iroquois helicopters.

##### Costs

5.85 The fleet of eight NH90 medium utility helicopters will be procured for a total of
$771 million which includes logistics and support. The estimated life, in service
through life costs, and the total cost of ownership are to be confirmed.

## 6. Projects Approved In Principle by the Government

### Joint Command and Control System 

##### Description

6.1 This project is designed to implement an automated command and control system
for the NZDF. This information technology (IT) based system will collect, collate,
process, display, store, disseminate and protect command and control information
in near real-time.

##### Policy Value

6.2 A Joint Command and Control System (JCCS) is an enabling capability for all of
the policy roles and tasks required of the NZDF. A JCCS enables elements from
all three services to work together efficiently and effectively by enhancing
decision-making processes.

##### Capability Gap

6.3 The NZDF's current command and control systems are largely manual and paper
based. Experience in recent operations and exercises has shown that the NZDF
system is dated and inefficient. This has impacted on the effectiveness of the
Joint Force Headquarters. The slower and less accurate decision making cycle
currently available to commanders is likely to lead to policy failure as it becomes
increasingly difficult for the NZDF to plan operations and effectively coordinate its
own operations.

##### Links to Other Capabilities

6.4 The JCCS is an overarching capability that contributes to all NZDF outputs. While
the JCCS will give the NZDF the ability to manage command and control
information, the project does not provide the ability to communicate data. The
JCCS will therefore depend on a suitable communications infrastructure. Linked
projects are:

    - Joint Communication Modernisation

    - Army Tactical Trunk Communications

    - Land ISR

    - P-3 Mission Systems Upgrade

    - Satellite Communications Capability

##### Timing

6.5 An Invitation to Register is likely to be released in the first half of 2007.

##### Current Status

6.6 The acquisition strategy for the project is currently being established.


-----

##### Costs

6.7 This project is expected to cost between $20 - $40 million. The estimated life, in
service through life costs, and the total cost of ownership are to be confirmed.

### NZDF Training/Light Utility Helicopter Capability

##### Description

6.8 This project will replace the Sioux training helicopters with a capability that meets
the NZDF's training and light utility needs.

##### Policy Value

6.9 A training helicopter is critical to providing a transition for pilots and crew to the
NH90 medium utility helicopters and the Navy's Seasprites. Light utility helicopters
are important for supporting a range of government and civil agencies in New
Zealand.

##### Capability Gap

6.10 The Sioux training helicopter is of 1950s vintage and is inadequate to meet
training needs. It does not provide an adequate step in pilot training progression
from the Airtrainer aircraft to operational utility and maritime helicopters and
provides no light utility capability.

##### Links to other Capabilities

6.11 This project has links to the following projects and capabilities:

    - NZDF Medium Utility Helicopter

    - Special Operations Capabilities

    - Multi-Role Vessel

    - Army Capabilities

##### Timing

6.12 There is some urgency to replace the Sioux training helicopter, which is expected
to occur during 2008.

##### Current Status

6.13 Cabinet will make decisions in 2006 on the training/light utility helicopter.

##### Costs

6.14 The training/light utility helicopter is estimated to cost about $110 million. The
estimated life, in service through life costs, and the total cost of ownership are to
be confirmed.

### Ohakea Consolidation Photo of RNZAF Base Ohakea.

_RNZAF Base Ohakea_

##### Description

6.15 This project will consolidate the RNZAF's operational capability at RNZAF Base
Ohakea.

##### Policy Value

6.16 The consolidation will be a core enabler for all RNZAF operations.

##### Capability Gap

6.17 Ohakea will require extensive improvements to existing infrastructure and
additional buildings to accommodate the personnel and functions transferring
from Whenuapai. Units transferring to Ohakea include No 40 Squadron (Fixed
Wing Transport Force), No 5 Squadron (Maritime Patrol Force) No 485 Wing
(command of force elements), Naval Support Flight (naval helicopters),
Operational Support Squadron, and a range of technical and administrative
support units and elements.

##### Links to Other Capabilities

6.18 This project has links to the following projects and capabilities:

    - NZDF Medium Utility Helicopter Capability

    - NZDF Training/Light Utility Helicopter Capability

    - P-3 Mission Management, and Communications, and Navigation Systems
Upgrades

    - C-130 Life Extension


-----

    - Boeing 727 Replacement / Boeing 757 Modification

##### Timing

6.19 This is yet to be finally determined.

##### Current Status

6.20 A prime project management consultant has just been appointed for the
infrastructure development project. The consultant will assist in developing a
more refined cost and time estimate for the preferred infrastructure development
option to be submitted in early 2007.

##### Costs

6.21 The project cost is yet to be determined. The estimated life is 50 years, in service
through life costs are $330 million, and the total cost of ownership is $750 million.

## 7. Projects Critical to Avoid the Failure of Policy

### Ohakea Base Taxiways Reconstruction

##### Description

7.1 This project proposes to reconstruct the Ohakea Base Taxiways 'A' and 'C' and
their associated hardstandings to keep the airfield fully operational for military and
commercial use and to ensure that they meet International Civil Aviation
Organisation (ICAO) standards for airfields.

##### Policy Value

7.2 The Government has agreed in principle to vacate Whenuapai and consolidate
the RNZAFs operational capability at Ohakea. Ohakea will be the sole operational
airfield for the Air Force supporting the operations of the maritime surveillance
aircraft, air transport aircraft, helicopters, and flying training aircraft. It will also
serve as the primary base for visiting foreign military and government aircraft.

##### Capability Gap

7.3 The hexagonal block construction of the taxiways is failing due to the heavier
aircraft using them. Up to 30 percent of the original slabs in some areas have
been replaced in the past but the slabs are now increasingly breaking in an
uncontrolled manner.

7.4 The taxiways have now reached a stage where their use by larger aircraft is
limited and is problematic for smaller aircraft. In particular, the taxiway is no
longer suitable for routine operation of jet transport aircraft. Restrictions on
aircraft operations at Ohakea impact on the ability of the Air Force to operate
effectively, particularly as the number of aircraft located at the base increases. It
also impacts on the Base's ability to handle and accommodate civil aircraft when
required as a diversion airfield.

7.5 In addition, the spacing of the taxiways from the cross runway and the taxiway
lighting do not currently comply with ICAO standards.

##### Links to Other Capabilities

7.6 This project has links to the following projects and capabilities:

    - Ohakea Runway Reconstruction (now completed)

    - Ohakea Consolidation

    - Maritime Helicopter Capability

    - NZDF Medium Utility Helicopter Capability

    - NZDF Training/Light Utility Helicopter Capability

    - P-3 Mission Management, and Communications, and Navigation Systems
Upgrades

    - C-130 Life Extension

    - Boeing 727 Replacement / Boeing 757 Modification


-----

    - RNZAF Flying Training

##### Timing

7.7 Reconstruction work needs to be undertaken in advance of the arrival of the NH90 helicopters.

##### Current Status

7.8 A study is underway to assess the magnitude of the work required and to
determine a design.

##### Costs

7.9 This project is expected to cost about $25 million. The estimated life is 50 years,
in service through life costs are $22 million, and the total cost of ownership is $46
million.


-----

### Joint Communications Modernisation

##### Description

7.9 This project proposes to modernise the NZDF's long-range and medium-range
communications capability to ensure that the NZDF maintains a reliable,
integrated, world-wide communications infrastructure.

7.10 The modernisation will support higher data transfer rates and modern
communication protocols, with a mix of military and commercial communications
services.

##### Policy Value

7.11 As communication is critical in almost all roles, the modernisation of the
communications infrastructure is important in the achievement of defence policy
objectives in New Zealand's environs, the South Pacific, the Asia-Pacific region
and, potentially, in contributions to global security and peacekeeping. This
communications infrastructure will support NZDF deployed forces, ships and
aircraft operating outside short-range radio coverage and enable communications
between force elements deployed to different parts of a theatre of operations.

##### Capability Gap

7.12 Current communications systems are Single Service oriented, technologically
dated, and comprise ad-hoc and short-term systems. Communications between
the Joint Force Headquarters and units deployed or operating beyond short-range
radio coverage will not meet requirements, resulting in an inability to exchange
information between NZDF units and allies. Deferral of this project will limit the
type and timeliness of information that can be exchanged and thus will limit the
ability of the NZDF to develop a modern, integrated command control
communications and intelligence capability.

##### Links to Other Capabilities

7.13 Long-range and medium-range communication systems form an essential part of
the NZDF communications infrastructure and contribute to all NZDF outputs. This
project is dependent on the completion of the Joint Command and Control System
project definition study and is linked to the Army Tactical Communications
System. Linked projects are:

    - Joint Command and Control Systems (JCCS)

    - Army Tactical Trunk Communications

    - NZDF Satellite Communications Capability

##### Timing

7.14 This is scheduled for acquisition around 2010.


-----

##### Current Status

7.15 A study is underway to determine the programme of work required to achieve an
integrated communications infrastructure. This study, along with input from the
JCCS project, will assist in developing a strategy to implement this project.

##### Costs

7.16 This project is expected to cost between $40 - $60 million. The estimated life, in
service through life costs, and the total cost of ownership are to be confirmed.


-----

### Army Tactical Trunk Communications

##### Description

7.17 This project proposes to replace and/or upgrade existing Army short-range
communications systems to provide a high bandwidth (high capacity) digital
theatre communication system to support command and control requirements of
the NZDF Battalion Group operations.

##### Policy Value

7.18 The Army Tactical Trunk Communications system will provide an enhanced
capability to exercise command and control over an NZDF battalion group, as well
as communicate with allied forces. It forms an important component of any
battalion group deployment, particularly in peace enforcement operations where
good command, control and communications enhance the safety and
effectiveness of land forces.

##### Capability Gap

7.19 Current Army tactical trunk communications systems are voice oriented,
technologically old, and are comprised of ad hoc and short-term systems. This
limits the Army's ability to exchange information between deployed Army subunits. An upgraded system would provide short-range communications that
interface between medium/long range communications and the tactical units.
This system needs to be military specification equipment.

##### Links to Other Capabilities

7.20 The Army tactical trunk communications system has links to:

    - Joint Command and Control Systems (JCCS)

    - Joint Communications Modernisation

    - Satellite Communications Capability

##### Timing 

7.21 This capability needs to be implemented following the outcome of the JCCS
project and on completion of a separate study to determine the work required to
achieve an integrated communications infrastructure.

##### Current Status

7.22 Awaiting decisions on the JCCS project.

##### Cost

7.23 This project is expected to cost up to $20 million. The estimated life, in service
through life costs, and the total cost of ownership are to be confirmed.


-----

### Land Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) and Tactical C4

##### Description

7.24 This project proposes to create a land based tactical Command, Control,
Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance
(C4ISR) system (battle group and below) able to exploit the advances in data
information exchange. It will acquire a Land ISR capability that will collect and
analyse information and tactical C4 system able to provide commanders and
subordinates with improved situational awareness, messaging, a common
operating picture, collaborative planning tools, fire support measures, and allow
joint and coalition interoperability.

##### Policy Value

7.25 The C4ISR acquisition will result in the establishment of a network-enabled
'systems of systems' that will exploit digital information from a range of sources
and consolidate tham under one system to ensure that tactical commanders have
the relevant information to make timely and accurate decisions. This system will
contribute a fundamental capability as part of all Land Outputs and many Joint
outputs.

##### Capability Gap

7.26 The Army does not have an integrated tactical C2 system at present nor does it
have an integrated Land ISR system; although discrete components of both do
exist.

##### Links to other Capabilities

7.27 This project has links to the following projects and capabilities:

    - Light Armoured Vehicles

    - Light Operational Vehicles

    - Multi-Role Vessel

    - Combat Service Support Vehicles

    - General Service Vehicle Fleet Replacement

    - Army Tactical Trunk Communications

    - Joint Command and Control System

    - Medium Utility Helicopter Capability

    - Training/Light Utility Helicopter Capability

    - P-3 Mission Management, and Communications, and Navigation Systems
Upgrades

    - Air Defence Upgrades


-----

##### Timing

7.28 This project is expected to be implemented over a three-year period from 2009/10

    - 2011/12.

##### Current Status

7.29 The Land ISR element of the project is in the initiation phase and the Land C2
element is in the concept development stage.

##### Costs

7.30 This project is expected to cost approximately $83 million, phased as follows:

    - FY 9/10 - $15 million

    - FY 10/11 - $24 million

    - FY 11/12 - $44 million

7.31 The estimated life is 10 years, in service through life costs are $33 million, and the
total cost of ownership is $116 million.

### Replacement of Devonport Naval Base 60hz Power Generation and Reticulation

##### Description

7.32 This project will upgrade the current 60 hertz (Hz) power generation and
reticulation system at Devonport Naval Base.

##### Policy Value

7.33 All RNZN ships are equipped with an onboard capacity to generate 60Hz power.
When berthed, however, it is highly desirable for this power to be generated
independently using a shore-based system. Not proceeding with the upgrade of
the 60Hz power generation and reticulation system at Devonport Naval Base
would make it very difficult for the Navy to maintain its current fleet at the level
required to meet the Government's defence policy objectives. The risk of policy
failure will increase as the Project Protector vessels enter into service from 2007
onwards.

##### Capability Gap

7.34 The Devonport Naval Base is currently equipped with a generation and
reticulation system that converts 50Hz power supplied from the national grid to
60Hz. But the infrastructure is old and is unable to support the existing fleet.
Each ANZAC frigate, for example, consumes half the total output. Temporary
generating capacity is therefore hired, at considerable cost, whenever a high
proportion of the fleet is berthed at Devonport. This has, however, become
increasingly problematic as the permanent system deteriorates and outages
become more frequent. Managing this shortfall will become even more difficult
once the Project Protector vessels come online.

##### Links to other Capabilities

7.35 This project has links to the following projects and capabilities:

    - Multi-Role Vessel

    - Patrol Vessels

    - ANZAC Class Self Defence Upgrade

    - ANZAC Class Platform Systems Refurbishment

##### Timing

7.36 This project is intended to proceed as soon as possible and will be completed
within a year of commencement.

##### Current Status

7.37 The project is ready to go to Cabinet.

##### Costs

7.38 This project is expected to cost between $10 - $15 million. The estimated life, in
service through life costs, and the total cost of ownership are to be confirmed.


-----

### Replacement of Devonport Naval Base Fuel Installation Facilities

##### Description

7.39 This project will rationalise and modernise the fuel installation (storage, defueling
and bilge cleaning capabilities) at Devonport Naval Base.

##### Policy Value

7.40 The Naval Fuel Installation (NFI) provides an essential strategic fuel storage
capability to enable the Navy to condition and distribute the correct fuel. This will
have added significance following the delivery of the Project Protector vessels.

##### Capability Gap

7.41 Existing facilities are inadequate, do not allow provision of a contingency reserve
stock (CRS), and there is currently an inability to store fuels unloaded from ships
undergoing maintenance.

7.42 Following the decommissioning of the fuel bunker tunnels, the Navy's fuelling
arrangements have been undertaken through a commercial supply and waste
product disposal contract, or by utilising the tanker HMNZS Endeavour (when
available). This leaves the Navy susceptible to the vagaries of commercial
delivery and does not allow for holding and control of a CRS or operational stock.

##### Links to other Capabilities

7.43 This project has links to the following projects and capabilities:

    - Multi-Role Vessel

    - Patrol Vessels

    - Afloat Replenishment

    - ANZAC Class Self Defence Upgrade

    - ANZAC Class Platform Systems Refurbishment

##### Timing

7.44 This project is intended to proceed as soon as possible and will be completed
within a year of commencement.

##### Current Status

7.45 The project will go to Cabinet shortly.

##### Costs

7.46 This project is expected to cost up to $20 million. The estimated life is 50 years, in
service through life costs are $11 million, and the total cost of ownership is $4
million.

### Advanced Pilot Training Capability (B200 Replacement) 

##### Description

7.47 This project proposes to maintain the ability to conduct advanced pilot training
after the expiry of the present B200 King Air lease in 2008. Outsourcing, leasing
and purchase options are being examined.

##### Policy Value

7.48 RNZAF pilot training is a core enabling capability that underlies all other NZDF
capabilities reliant on trained pilots. The Advanced Pilot Training capability is
critical to the NZDF being able to graduate pilots for Air Force and Navy with the
skills needed for transition to the operational aircraft of the NZDF. The B200 King
Air provides a multi-engine platform that bridges the skill gap, aircraft performance
and cockpit technology between the basic CT4E Airtrainer aircraft and the larger,
more complex, aircraft of the NZDF.

##### Capability Gap

7.49 With the present and projected structure of the Air Force and Navy fleets now
defined by other projects, there is an enduring requirement for a multi-engined
advanced pilot training. Recently approved aircraft modification and purchase
projects have also generated a requirement for training on high technology flight
systems. The capability includes a requirement for a flight simulator.

##### Links to other Capabilities

7.50 This project has links to the following projects and capabilities:

    - P-3 Mission Management, and Communications, and Navigation Systems
Upgrades

    - C-130 Life Extension

    - Boeing 727 Replacement / Boeing 757 Modification

    - NZDF Medium Utility Helicopter Capability

    - NZDF Training/Light Utility Helicopter

    - Maritime Helicopter Capability

##### Timing

7.51 The present B200 King Air lease expires in June 2008. To avoid a gap in the
throughput of NZDF trainee pilots, approval of the selected option will be required
from the Government in time to implement the solution before the end of lease. In
the case of a procurement option this will need to be approved prior to the end of
2006.

##### Current Status

7.52 Preliminary work is underway to scope the options.


-----

##### Costs

7.53 This will be dependant on the options identified.

## 8. Projects Essential to Avoid the Failure of Policy

### ANZAC Class Self-Defence Upgrade

##### Description

8.1 This project proposes to upgrade the
ANZAC Class frigates' self defence systems
to protect the Naval Combat Force, and
ships under its immediate protection,
against increasingly sophisticated anti-ship
systems, and to address equipment
obsolescence.

##### Policy Value

8.2 The role of the Naval Combat Force is to
meet military tasks, particularly in support of
the Government's regional and global
objectives. The ANZACs are critical to the
protection of Australian/New Zealand
territorial sovereignty, for participating in

Five Power Defence Arrangements
activities, supporting our relationships with
regional partners, and undertaking peace
support operations in the Asia-Pacific region and beyond. These environments
contain significantly higher threats to surface vessels than exist in New Zealand's
immediate area, including air and sub-surface threats. To continue operating in
these environments, and therefore meet the Government's policy requirements,
the ANZACs will require an upgrade to their defensive systems to meet the
changing threat levels in these areas.  Photo of HMNZS Te Kaha.


##### Capability Gap

8.3 By the end of the decade, the increase in air, surface and sub-surface threats,
and the sophistication of these threats, within the Australia/Asia-Pacific region and
beyond will mean that the ANZACs defensive systems will become increasingly
ineffective. Consequently, the operational capability of the ANZACs will decline to
the point where their ability to operate in these environments would carry serious
risks.

8.4 The design of the majority of self-defence equipment on the ANZACs will be
approaching 25 years of age by 2010. Support will become increasingly difficult
and operating costs will rise. In some cases, such as the anti-air missile, existing
systems are becoming increasingly difficult to support.

##### Links to other Capabilities

8.5 This project has links to the following projects and capabilities:

    - P-3 Air-to-Surface Weapon

    - ANZAC Class Close-in Weapon System Upgrade and Refurbishment


-----

##### Timing

8.6 This project is timed to commence around 2010. The ANZAC Self Defence
Upgrade will be conducted in a series of phases. The first phase will address
Close-In Weapon System combat viability shortcomings; the second phase will
address immediate interoperability and supportability concerns; and, at present,
the full scope of the third and fourth phases cannot yet be fully determined.

##### Current Status

8.7 The potential benefits of adopting those aspects of the Australian Defence Force's
ANZAC class upgrade programme, that support NZDF policy based capability
requirements, are being studied. The cost of maintaining current systems is also
under investigation so that the benefits of the upgrade from a Total Cost of
Ownership perspective can be considered.

##### Costs

8.8 This project is expected to cost between $450-$500 million. The estimated life is
14 years, in service through life costs are $950 million, and the total cost of
ownership is $1.4 billion.


-----

### C-130 Self-Protection

##### Description

8.9 This project proposes to upgrade the C-130 self-protection system to provide the
ability to detect and counter likely threats, primarily man-portable infrared (IR)
missiles.

##### Policy Value

8.10 The C-130 is a critical enabler for many NZDF operations. It provides essential
air transport for a number of roles and tasks, including: supporting counterterrorist operations; peace support operations; and evacuations of New
Zealanders from trouble spots. Many of these operations involve the C-130s
landing in locations that are under threat of hostile air defence weapons.
Increasingly coalition forces in places such as Afghanistan will not allow aircraft to
operate without a credible standard of self-protection.

8.11 C-130s are expensive assets that carry a significant number of people. It is
important therefore to protect those assets and minimise the risks to people
onboard.

##### Capability Gaps

8.12 The current C-130 self-protection fit was installed in the early 1990s. Since that
time there has been a significant increase in the sophistication and availability of
missiles. The current system is no longer appropriate for today's threat
environment.

8.13 In the last 15 years, 90 percent of all aircraft lost in combat have been attributed
to infrared (IR) guided missiles. Specifically, these aircraft have fallen to manportable missile systems. These shoulder-launched systems are widespread
globally. Lack of a self-protection capability could limit the use of our C-130s in
humanitarian or peace support operations globally.

##### Links to Other Capabilities

8.14 This project has links to the following projects and capabilities:

    - P-3 Self-Protection

    - C-130 Life Extension

##### Timing

8.15 The most practicable time to complete this project is during the C-130 Life
Extension and Communications and Navigation Systems Upgrade project. Not
conducting the projects concurrently risks increased costs and serious restrictions
on the employability of the upgraded C-130 across the range of employment
scenarios post upgrade.

##### Current Status

8.16 Work is underway to determine the appropriate self-protection requirement and
the most suitable time to equip the aircraft.


-----

##### Costs

8.17 This project is expected to cost up to $20 million. The estimated life, in service
through life costs, and the total cost of ownership are to be confirmed.


-----

### P-3 Self-Protection 

##### Description

8.18 This project proposes to equip the P-3 with a self-protection capability to counter
likely threats, primarily man-portable infrared (IR) missiles.

##### Policy Value

8.19 The capability provided by the P-3 is critical to meeting many of the roles and
tasks required of the NZDF across the range of the Government's defence policy
objectives. The P-3 is one of the primary capabilities that contributes to our
defence relationships with Australia and Five Power Defence Arrangements
partners, and is of high utility for collective global security and humanitarian relief
operations.

8.20 P-3s are expensive assets and can carry up to 21 people. It is important to protect
those assets and minimise the risks to people onboard.

##### Capability Gaps

8.21 In the last 15 years, 90 percent of all aircraft lost in combat have been attributed
to infrared (IR) guided missiles. Specifically, these aircraft have fallen to manportable missile systems. These shoulder-launched systems are widespread
globally. Lack of a self-protection capability could limit the use of our P-3s in
peace support operations globally.

8.22 The P-3 currently has no dedicated self-protection equipment. The aircraft's
sensors inherently provide protection from long-range and/or obvious threats.
Man-portable missiles are easy to conceal, however, and detection of IR sensors
is not possible before the aircraft has closed within range of the weapon. It is
therefore necessary to be able to detect the missile launch and use
countermeasure techniques to defeat it.

##### Links to Other Capabilities

8.23 This project has links to the following projects and capabilities:

    - C-130 Self-Protection

    - P-3 Mission Management, and Communication, and Navigation Systems
Upgrades

    - P-3 Air-to-Surface Weapons

##### Timing

8.24 The most practicable time to complete this project is during the P-3 systems
upgrade project. Not conducting the projects concurrently risks serious restrictions
on the employability of the upgraded P-3 across the range of employment
scenarios post upgrade.

##### Current Status

8.25 Work is underway to determine the appropriate self-protection requirement and
the most suitable time to equip the aircraft.


-----

##### Costs

8.26 This project is expected to cost around $40 million from 2013. The estimated life,
in service through life costs, and the total cost of ownership are to be confirmed.

## 9. Projects Necessary to Avoid the Failure of Policy

### ANZAC Class Close-In Weapon System Upgrade and Refurbishment

##### Description

9.1 This project proposes to upgrade the Phalanx Close-In Weapon System (CIWS)
which provides a last line of defence and protection from Anti-Ship Missiles (ASM)
and strike aircraft. It also has the potential to provide an effective defence against
Fast Inshore Attack Craft (FIAC).

##### Policy Value

9.2 In order to meet policy objectives, the ANZAC class frigates must be capable of
operating in environments where there is a risk of attack from ASM and FIAC. To
be able to operate in such environments without undue risk or constraint, the
frigates must be equipped with a level of self-defence against such threats. The
CIWS provides a substantial proportion of this self-defence capability.

##### Capability Gaps

9.3 The CIWS system needs to be refurbished to rectify capability shortfalls, and
should be upgraded to counter advances in the ASM threat and increasing
numbers of FIAC attacks. The Phalanx system manufacturer has produced two
sequential upgrade packages known as Block 1A, which addresses advances in
the ASM threat; and Block 1B, which provides a capability to engage surface
targets such as FIAC. Block 1B incorporates Block 1A.

9.4 Availability of the current system is currently well below the level needed to
support operations in other than low threat environments, and can be expected to
deteriorate further.

##### Links to other Capabilities

9.5 This project has links to the following projects and capabilities:

    - ANZAC Class Self Defence Upgrade

##### Timing 

9.6 The project should begin as soon as possible.

##### Costs

9.7 The CIWS Block 1B upgrade is expected to cost between $20 - $25 million. The
estimated life, in service through life costs, and the total cost of ownership are to
be confirmed.


-----

### P-3 Air-to-Surface Weapons

##### Description

9.8 This project proposes to equip the P-3 aircraft with an anti-ship missile capability.

##### Policy Value

9.9 Equipping the P-3 aircraft with an anti-ship missile capability would significantly
enhance the value of these aircraft in fulfilling policy roles relating to the territorial
sovereignty of New Zealand and Australia, playing an appropriate role in the
maintenance of security in the Asia-Pacific region, and participating in the Five
Power Defence Arrangements.

##### Capability Gap

9.10 Disbanding the Air Combat Force has resulted in the loss of the maritime strike
capability. The P-3s provide targeting information but do not have an anti-ship
capability. The inability to take immediate action against surface threats limits the
P-3s ability to provide force protection for New Zealand naval vessels, particularly
the frigates and, in future, the MRV.

##### Links to other Capabilities

9.11 This project has links to the following projects and capabilities:

    - P-3 Mission, Communications, and Navigation Systems Upgrades

    - Multi-Role Vessel

    - ANZAC Frigates

##### Timing

9.12 The timing of this project is dependent on the completion of the P-3 mission
systems upgrade. The modification required to enable the P-3 to launch anti-ship
missiles is relatively straightforward and could be done during routine
maintenance. Before a missile capability is added, the mission systems upgrade
would be necessary to provide sensors capable of locating and properly
identifying targets.

##### Current Status

9.13 A study will be conducted in due course to determine the appropriate weapons for
the P-3.

##### Costs

9.14 This project is not yet costed. The estimated life, in service through life costs, and
the total cost of ownership are to be confirmed.


-----

### NZDF Torpedo Replacement

##### Description

9.15 This project proposes to replace the torpedoes for the ANZAC frigates, P-3 Orions
and SH-2G Seasprite helicopters to maintain the ANZAC's basic self-defence
capability against sub-surface threats and the P-3s area anti-submarine
capability.

##### Policy Value

9.16 The role of the Naval Combat Force is to meet military tasks, particularly in
support of the Government's regional and global objectives. The ANZACs are
critical to the protection of Australia/New Zealand territorial sovereignty, for
participating in Five Power Defence Arrangements activities, supporting our
relationships with regional partners, and undertaking peace support operations in
the Asia-Pacific and beyond. These environments contain significantly higher
threats to surface vessels than exist in New Zealand's immediate environs,
including air and sub-surface threats. Torpedoes provide a basic self-defence
capability against sub-surface threats, and enable the ANZACs to be safely
deployed in these environments.

9.17 The P-3s require a torpedo replacement to maintain their current capability to fulfil
the above policy roles.

##### Capability Gap

9.18 The current torpedoes will reach the end of their life around 2008/9, limiting the
ability of the ANZACs to be deployed to areas beyond the South Pacific where
sub-surface threats may be encountered. This would impact most significantly on
the ability of the ANZACs to provide support for peace enforcement operations. It
would also limit the utility of the ANZACs as a contribution to the protection of
New Zealand/Australia territorial sovereignty.

9.19 The absence of a torpedo capability will mean that the P-3 aircraft will be unable
to provide area protection for New Zealand naval vessels against submarine
threats.

##### Links to other Capabilities

9.20 This project has links to the following projects and capabilities:

    - ANZAC Class Self-Defence Upgrade

    - Multi-Role Vessel

    - P-3 Air-to-Surface Weapons

    - P-3 Mission Systems Upgrade

##### Timing

9.21 The current Mark 46 Mod 2 torpedo will not be supportable beyond about 2008/9.
A replacement will need to be in service before the current torpedoes become
unsupportable.


-----

##### Current Status

9.22 Work is underway to consider options to replace the current torpedo. A
replacement is not likely to be affordable until 2015.

##### Costs

9.23 This project has not yet been costed. The estimated life, in service through life
costs, and the total cost of ownership are to be confirmed.


-----

### ANZAC Class Platform Systems Upgrade

##### Description

9.24 This project seeks to ensure that ANZAC class platform systems remain viable.
Platform systems, as distinct from combat systems, provide those elements of a
warship's capability that enable it to move, float, generate power, recover from
damage, and accommodate people.

##### Policy Value

9.25 A platform systems refit is required to ensure that the ANZACs remain capable of
meeting policy objectives. The role of the Naval Combat Force is to meet military
tasks, particularly in support of the Government's regional and global objectives.
The ANZACs are critical to protection of Australia/New Zealand territorial
sovereignty, for participating in Five Power Defence Arrangements activities,
supporting our relationships with regional partners, and undertaking peace
support operations in the Asia-Pacific region and beyond.

##### Capability Gap

9.26 Heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems, propulsion diesel engines, gas
turbines, automatic generating equipment, and main machinery control systems
will become obsolete and impossible to support. Other systems will simply wear
out.

##### Links to other Capabilities

9.27 This project has links to the following projects and capabilities:

    - ANZAC Class Self Defence Upgrade

##### Timing

9.28 This project can be expected to commence around 2008/2009.

##### Current Status

9.29 Work is proceeding to determine the optimum schedule for platform system
replacement and options are being studies.

##### Costs

9.30 This project is expected to cost between $50 - $60 million, spread evenly over the
period 2008 - 2010. The estimated life is 16 years, in service through life costs are
$130 million, and the total cost of ownership is $185 million.


-----

### NZDF Satellite Communications Capability

##### Description

9.31 This project involves the acquisition of a strategic communications capability,
particularly X-Band, by engagement in the NZLSAT project. Defence
engagement will be by the purchase of dedicated transponders on the satellite for
NZDF usage.

##### Policy Value

9.32 Strategic communications in the form of high band-width capability is required to
support NZDF deployments. The NZDF will be able to provide guaranteed secure
communications to its operational deployments, in a manner which is
interoperable with potential coalition partners, particularly Australia. The NZDF
will also be able to provide immediately available strategic communications into
the Pacific to support whole of Government operations, such as for humanitarian
assistance.

##### Capability Gap

9.33 Currently the NZDF does not have a guaranteed secure strategic communications
capability. To support existing missions, satellite capability is organised on an adhoc basis, using commercial or coalition partner satellites. Neither system is able
to guarantee secure, uninterrupted capability. The future growth of the NZDF's
command and control capability will require significantly more secure bandwidth
than currently used.

##### Links to other Capabilities

9.34 This project will support the Joint Command and Control Systems and provide
improved information flow for the P3 aircraft, all RNZN ships and Army
components. Ground stations for communications will be procured through the
Joint Communications Modernisation project and the Army Tactical Trunk
Communications project.

##### Timing

9.35 Contract signature with NZLSAT is required between December 2006 and March
2007. The satellite will be launched in 2010 and has a scheduled life of 15 years.

##### Current Status

9.36 Defence is conducting a cost-benefit evaluation of the proposal.

##### Costs

9.37 This project is expected to cost $100 million. More detailed costs will be available
once the specifications have been confirmed. There are options for either direct
acquisition (approx $100M) or annual leasing (approx $20M per year). The
estimated life, in service through life costs, and the total cost of ownership are to
be confirmed.


-----

### General Service Vehicle Fleet Replacement

##### Description

9.38 This will replace the Army's general service vehicle fleet including medium and
heavy vehicles, trailers and mechanical handling equipment.

##### Policy Value

9.39 The general service fleet is a critical enabler for land force operations. This fleet
sustains and resupplies forces with fuel, ammunition, rations, personnel and
spares and provides maintenance support. The fleet has utility in meeting a wide
range of policy objectives.

##### Capability Gap

9.40 The current fleet of general service vehicles and trailers are approaching the end
of their economic life and will require replacement.

##### Links to other Capabilities

9.41 This project has links to the following projects and capabilities:

    - Light Armoured Vehicles

    - Light Operational Vehicles

    - Multi-Role Vessel

    - Combat Service Support Vehicles

##### Timing

9.42 It is proposed to replace the vehicles beginning in 2011.

##### Current Status

9.43 Preliminary work is currently underway within Defence to scope this project.

##### Costs

9.44 The estimated cost of this project is around $550 million. The estimated life, in
service through life costs, and the total cost of ownership are still to be confirmed.

## 10. Projects that have Benefit but are Less Critical to Achieving Policy Objectives

### High Readiness Infantry Company

10.1 The Army does not maintain a high readiness infantry company that can
undertake many short-notice tasks. This represents a policy gap and affects
deployment times.

### Short to Medium Range Aerial Patrol

10.2 The Maritime Patrol Review identified a need for a short-medium range air patrol
capability to complement the long range P-3. Options include provision of patrol
services by a commercial contractor or by the Air Force. These options are
currently under consideration by the Government.

### Remote Mine Detection

10.3 The Maritime Forces Review identified a requirement to protect New Zealand's
major ports by developing a capacity to detect and dispose of mines and other
explosives underwater. The Review concluded that the mine countermeasures
role should be retained. The capability of the Navy to detect mine-like objects is
becoming increasingly difficult as current equipment reaches the end of its
economic life. Upgrading this capability would significantly improve the safety of
personnel and ships over the current inadequate, emergency only, systems.

### Indirect Fire Support Weapon

10.4 Army currently has 81mm mortars and the 105mm artillery howitzer. Based on
current usage and firing wear and tear, both weapons are expected to require
replacement around 2012. A study will be conducted in due course to determine
the appropriate indirect fire support weapon capability.

### Infrastructure projects

10.5 There are a range of infrastructure requirements that will need to be addressed
over the next ten years. These projects will upgrade or replace existing facilities
and may reduce infrastructure and operating costs.


-----

## 11. Projects Previously on the LTDP and Moved to the Defence Capital Programme - Minors

### Army Manoeuvre Range

11.1 A moving target range enables soldiers and commanders to practice skills
necessary to conduct motorised operations. The range would allow the practice of
low level manoeuvre (up to platoon level) while engaging static and moving
targets.

### Army Engineering Equipment

11.2 This project will improve the Army's engineering equipment and therefore its
ability to support mobility of the motorised land force. Equipment includes:

    - Combat engineering tractors

    - Rapid gap crossing system

    - Water purification/storage

### Combat Service Support Vehicles

11.3 This project proposes to provide additional combat service support vehicles and
associated equipment to support the Light Armoured Vehicles.

### Direct Fire Support Weapon

11.4 The direct fire support weapon project will provide land forces with the ability to
engage opposing forces.

### NZDF Weapon Replacement

11.5 This project proposes the replacement or upgrade of selected current small arms
based weapon systems and the addition of new weapon systems to the NZDF to
enhance the NZDF's ability to achieve its required outputs.
