## Foreword


he political changes that occurred
in Uganda between 1966 and 1986
resulted into the decline of national

# T

institutions and infrastructure. The Ministry
of Defence (MOD) and particularly the Army
were also affected. The personnel in most of
the arms of the forces were displaced, records
destroyed, systems and operating procedures
disorganized. These herald the collapse of
basic structures and infrastructure of the
defence forces.

When the NRM/A came into power in 1986, it
became imperative of the leadership to rebuild
these systems from scratch. The vision and
commitment has been to transform UPDF
into a modern, professional, efficient and
accountable defence force. By keeping with
this commitment, the Ministry of defence
conducted a comprehensive, consultative
and transparent Defence Review whose key
findings are now published.

In line with the broader notion of security
to which Uganda subscribes, the defence
review process was a cross-Government
initiative. The Ministry of Defence led the
process in close collaboration with other


government departments and agencies;
the UPDF, parliament, academia and
members of the civil society. This resulted
in the formulation of the comprehensive
Defence Policy.

The Defence Policy sets out the missions
of the UPDF and policy guidance on the
military capability needed for planning
of the defence forces. It also provides
the policy basis for the transformation
and modernization of Uganda’s defence
forces.

It represents our collective assessment of
the security challenges facing the nation.
The basic message in this White Paper is
that an integrated approach is required
to address Uganda’s security concerns.
The approach should effectively make
use of all policy instruments available
to Government, of which defence has a
central role to play.

The White Paper, lays out the challenges
of transforming the defence forces so that
they can achieve their missions effectively.
It also suggests that the transformation
programme must be informed by
and supportive of the wider national
development objectives.

This is an ambitious undertaking that
requires the understanding and support of
all stakeholders including the public, wider
government and development partners.
It is this principle that underpins the
publication and wide circulation of this
White paper.

**Minister of Defence**


-----

This White paper presents the key findings of the
Defence Review and proposes a strategy for defence
transformation. The White paper is the basis for a
detailed Corporate Plan to guide implementation
of the Reforms.

The Defence Review involved four phases of
work:
1) A comprehensive assessment of Uganda’s
security environment;

2) A review of both defence and security

policies;

3) Examination and costing of operational and
non-operational defence requirements; and

4) Development of a strategy for defence

transformation.

While the main objective of the Defence Review
was to assist Uganda to plan for the long-term, the
transformation programme also of necessity took
into account Uganda’s immediate security needs.
This made it important to achieve an appropriate
balance between activities designed to achieve
short-term improvements in defence capability
and those designed to lay the groundwork for
long-term gains in efficiency and effectiveness in
the defence forces.

The Review recommended that Uganda’s strategic
military requirement should be a small, affordable,
well-equipped and trained force, consisting of
approximately 48,000 soldiers, backed by adequate
combat support and a reserve force. To carry
out its operations in an effective and efficient
manner, there are a range of requirements on
the non-operational side which relate to policy
and planning; financial management; logistics,
procurement and infrastructure; and human
resource management and welfare.

Even with increases in the current defence budget,
comprehensive defence transformation cannot


#### EXECUTIVE SUMMARY


be achieved in the short or medium-term. An
incremental approach is thus required. Such an
approach is based upon evaluating the costs of
undertaking particular ‘packages’ of development
and then scheduling them against the priorities
discussed in this paper in such a way that the costs
of the emerging plan are affordable.

In conclusion, the transformation programme
below has been laid down as the guiding principle
in taking the transformation work forward as
follows:

a. The dual approach of addressing immediate
operational needs as well as laying the

foundations for long term improvements in

efficiency and effectiveness within the defence

forces;

b. The broad priorities identified in both the
operational and non-operational areas of

work.

##### CHAPTER ONE – BACKGROUND

###### 1.1 Introduction

 The Government of Uganda carried out a Defence Review as a response to government’s supreme obligation to safeguard the sovereignty of the nation and protect its citizens and their properties. It is also a step towards the fulfilment of President Yoweri Museveni’s pledge, made during the 2001 Presidential Elections, to modernize and professionalise the Uganda Peoples Defence Forces (UPDF). The Defence Review, therefore, was an important milestone in Uganda’s quest to develop an effective, affordable and efficient force with sufficient capabilities to safeguard its security interests.

 This White Paper spells out the vision of the Government of Uganda in respect of her defence sector. It outlines the outcome of a comprehensive defence review that identified the missions, tasks and desired military capability to deter the threats that Uganda may face. It also spells out the means at Uganda’s disposal to work towards the defence vision of a modern defence force.

 1.2  Aim of the White Paper

 This white paper is a plan on how the government of Uganda will tackle the challenges to transform, modernise and professionalise the defence forces.

 1.3 Structure of the White Paper

 The White Paper consists of seven chapters:

  Chapter one is the background.

 • Chapter two examines the security challenges facing Uganda, the importance of
 security in the country’s overall development, and the specific security threats

 and dilemmas that Uganda must prepare for.

 • Chapter three examines how Uganda will meet its security challenges within her development strategies and priorities. It also examines and allots roles and respon sibilities to different Government security actors, and the specific contribution of 
 the defence sector.

 • Based on the above assessment, Chapter four discusses Uganda’s vision for defence
 transformation. The vision is premised on two pillars: a professional and capable

 defence force, and a strong civil-military partnership.

 • Chapter five examines the Government’s suggested priorities for defence transfor- mation in both the military and defence management.

 • Chapter six discusses the implementation of the defence transformation. It highlights
 the strategy, budgetary issues, and programming.


-----

###### • The final chapter examines the specific contribution expected from all the main
 stakeholders, development partners as well as the wider public.

 1.4 Uganda’s Political and Military History

 The current challenges in Uganda’s strategic security environment are a result of its political and military history, (considered in more detail at Annex A). In broad terms, Uganda is a constellation of a number of kingship groups, historically linked through trade, ethnic linguistic ties, and wars of conquest. The British militarily amalgamated all the groupings into a modern-day state. The colonial military philosophy entrenched a policy of ‘divide and rule’ both within the military and society. Successive post-inde­ pendence governments used a similar philosophy to oppress the citizens instead of devel­ oping a ‘pro-people’ military ideology. This hampered the efforts to build a strong nation with a secure environment conducive to social cohesion and national development.

 The National Resistance Army, now UPDF, emerged to respond to this state of affairs. The guerrilla struggle waged by NRA from 1981-86 was premised on a close relation­ ship with the local population. However, the operational structures and practices which supported the NRA to wage a successful bush war then, did not of neccesity conform to the requirements of an army serving a democratic modern state. While the UPDF had already taken steps to transform itself into a professional army (see Box below), its efforts were hampered by a number of factors including lack of resources and persistent insecurity in the region.  


**_Milestones in improving the Defence Forces performance since 1986_**


**»** 1986 - Legal Notice No. 1 repealed the 1964 Armed Forces Act and legalized the status of the NRA

as the new national army.

**»** 1992 - NRA Statute was enacted emphasizing the pro-people military ethic.

**»** 1992-94 - NRA undertook a significant demobilization programme to reduce the size of its person

nel in order to create resources for the modernization programme.


**»** 1995 - The promulgation of a new Constitution that defined the role of the army and provided a


framework for governing the defence forces.

**»** 1997 - World Bank funded Logistics and Accounting Reform Programme (LARP) study.

**»** 1998 - UK-funded Uganda Defence Efficiency Study (UDES).

**»** 2000 - The National Security Council Act provided a mechanism to coordinate defence activities

and those of the other national security agencies.

**»** 2001 - Uganda Defence Reform Programme (UDRP) was launched.

**»** 2002 – The comprehensive Defence Bill, containing provisions to regulate UPDF’s organs and

structures, welfare issues of the army and deployment outside Uganda, is tabled for discussion

by Cabinet.

**»** 2002 – The Defence Review was Launched

**»** 2003 - The Defence Policy was approved by Cabinet

###### 1.5 Rationale for the Defence Review

 From 1986, Uganda made significant progress in addressing poverty and stemming the advance of HIV/AIDS through implementation of conducive social-economic interven­ tions and putting poverty reduction top on her development agenda. The challenge of short-falls in revenue collections has however led Government and development part­ ners to focus their attention on the levels of defence spending. An arbitrary ceiling at 2% of GDP was agreed. This figure was neither based on a real assessment of Uganda’s security needs nor an analysis of the risks to development arising from ignoring the potential threats. Government with the support of the development partners, under took a defence review to provide a framework to assess the needs of the defence sector in view of the scarce public resources.

 The Defence Review was the first stage in the defence transformation process intended to address a number of closely interlinked factors which include:


**»** ensuring that defence is effectively positioned within a wider Government strategy

for addressing the national security problems in the context of all existing security

instruments;

**»** providing a rational basis for assessing force capability including numbers of

personnel, equipment and the welfare of all the forces that support them to

carry out their functions;

**»** ensuring that available resources are used efficiently and effectively with respect

to national policy objectives; to attain value for money;

**»** strengthening institutions so that policy and decision-making is carried out under

a systematic framework;

**»** Ensuring a peoples’ defence force that respects the rights of the citizens or non
partisan, patriotic, and national in both composition and character.


###### To address the above challenges, the Defence Review assessed Uganda’s key defence requirements in the light of diverse security threats facing the nation in short, medium and long-term. Recommendations on how those requirements could be achieved were made through the process of the review.

 1.6 The Defence Review Process

 The Defence Review was carried out from June 2002 to May 2004. The process was managed by the Defence Reform Unit of the Ministry of Defence, with assistance from the British Government. The methodology for the Defence Review was based on a generic model developed by the Defence Reform Unit and the Defence Advisory Team (DAT) UK. The Review was guided by the following three key principles:


-----

**_Principles Guiding the Defence Review_**

**»** **_Comprehensiveness – Uganda’s Defence missions were assessed against the roles_**

of other Government departments and agencies. Annex B summarises the

different stages of the Defence Review process.

**»** **_Inclusiveness – The Defence Review was to be a cross-governmental initiative_**

involving the UPDF, Government departments and agencies with an interest in

security matters, and a number of non-governmental stakeholders including

academicians and the civil society. Annex C provides a list of the different groups

consulted during the process.

**»** **_Transparency - A clear record of all decisions made by the different working groups_**

was kept so that the final recommendations could be fully justified.

###### CHAPTER TWO –SECURITY AND DEVELOPMENT IN UGANDA

 2.1  Introduction

 This chapter assesses the security challenges facing Uganda and examines the importance of security for the country’s development; identifies the nation’s core security interests. It also highlights the security threats and dilemmas.

 2.2  Importance of Security for Development

**_2.2.1 Uganda’s definition of National Security_**

###### Security encompasses freedom from fear, intimidation and other pressures or threats, real or potential, from whatever source, that would undermine the basic rights, welfare and property of the people of Uganda, the territorial integrity of the state, or the proper functioning of the systems of governance. 

**_2.2.2 Link Between Security and Development_**

###### Uganda recognises that security and development are mutually reinforcing and inter­ linked. Development without security is not sustainable, and security without develop­ ment is not durable. The linkage between the two needs to be appreciated. Unresolved conflict, particularly if violent, can instantly disrupt or reverse years of development efforts, diverting resources that could be used for improving the quality of life and there­ by undermining the development of the community. The damage to society may not be just short term, physical or physiological but also psychological as well. On the other hand, underdeveloped communities suffer insecurity and violence caused by unfair dis­ tribution of resources. Underdevelopment also has its dangers. An underdeveloped com­ munity may suffer insecurity and violence caused by tensions over unfair distribution and disparities or social attitudes of groups who have little invested in the community.

 Without security and tranquillity, national issues become less relevant to the individual who focuses increasingly upon survival. At its extreme, the citizens feel unprotected from both internal and external threats limiting their ability to support and contribute to national development efforts.

 2.2.3 Uganda’s Core Security Interests

 The following are Uganda’s security interests:


-----

**_Uganda’s Core Security Interests_**

a) A society that functions according to principles of Justice, Freedom and

Democracy, where fundamental Human Rights are promoted and protected.

b) A political environment in which power is exercised by a democratically-elected

leadership, and where the military is subordinate to civil authority.

c) A state that empowers the active participation of all Ugandans in the governance

process, and works to meet their basic needs such as health, education, shelter,

clean water and food .

d) A country that is secure and united, where everybody is free to participate in

activities to develop economically.

e) A nation that has the capacity to defend herself from external threats and to

maintain her National Sovereignty, Independence and Territorial integrity.

f) A country at peace with all her neighbours and supports regional/ global efforts to

maintain peace, stability, and fulfils her international obligations.


###### 2.3 Uganda’s Security Environment

 It is not possible to predict with precision the kinds of security problems Uganda will face in the future. Therefore Uganda must be prepared to face a range of possible‘scenarios’, ranging from the ‘best’ to the ‘worst’ case. These scenarios must not be so extreme as to represent unreasonable view of the future. The scenarios are categorized as:

**_a._** **_Best Scenario – A Prosperous and Stable Uganda._**

**_b._** **_Intermediate Scenario – A Uganda Striving to Consolidate Development Gains._**

**_c._** **_Worst Scenario – A Uganda in Disarray._**

**_2.3.1 The Strategic Setting_**

###### The factors that influence Uganda’s security environment have been evaluated focusing at global, regional and national levels. The following factors that cut across were identi­ fied:

**_Global issues_**

###### • Globalisation: Increasing globalisation, the impact of unfair terms of trade

 coupled with competition subjected to developing economies, makes globali
 sation a threat.

 • External Aid: The government of Uganda has for sometime depended on exter
 nal support for it’s public spending. This makes Uganda vulnerable to future aid

 cuts, and could also subject her to foreign influences that are not in her best 
 interest.

 • Terrorism: The increasing global terrorism makes Uganda also vulnerable since

 it is not an exception.

 • Technology: Uganda’s low level of technological development makes it depen
 dent on externally developed technology for which it must pay for dearly.


-----

**_Regional issues_**

###### • Geo-politics: Uganda is situated in the heart of Africa’s conflict-ridden Great

 Lakes Region. She has to contend with the ‘overflow’ of wars from neighbouring

 countries and, as a consequence, devote more resources than she might otherwise

 have to, on protecting her borders. Uganda has hosted refugees from Sudan,

 Rwanda, Democratic Republic of Congo, Somalia and Ethiopia because of the

 conflicts in these countries. Uganda has also on several occasions been sucked into

 these conflicts either as a host to fleeing people or as a participant in the con- 
 flict. 

 • Shallow Strategic Depth: Uganda is a small country in comparison with

 most of her neighbours. Her ‘strategic depth ratio’ of 93 km² of territory

 to every km of border reduces her defensive options in the event of external

 attack. This requires pro-active strategies to promote regional cohesion, manage

 the borders better and deter potential adversaries.

 • Shared Natural Resources: Uganda shares a number of valuable natural resources

 with her neighbours. These include the Nile River, Lake Victoria, the Rwenzori

 Mountains and potential oil deposits in the Western border regions that

 increase the stakes for control of these resources.

 • Landlockedness: Uganda’s landlockedness increases her vulnerability in times

 of regional conflict by reducing options for transiting her goods in and out.

 Even in norma times, landlockedness constrains economic development by

 increasing the cost of exporting and importing through transport charges,

 which discourages external investors.

 • Porous Borders: Uganda’s borders are particularly porous because many of

 them do not coincide with natural barriers like mountains or rivers. This makes

 it harder to detect and control cross-border access by potentially disruptive

 groups. The enduring security problems arising out of these porous borders

 and prolonged conflicts are the proliferation of small arms and cross border 
 raids.

**_National issues_**

###### • Economy: About 35% of Ugandans live below the poverty line. The per capita

 income is US$ 300 per annum. Poverty creates conditions in which armed vio

 lence, communal conflict, organized crime and terrorism can emerge and thrive.

 Poverty also implies that fewer resources are available to the state to address these

 problems. Uganda’s economy is dominated by peasant subsistence agri

 culture that accounts for about 50% of GDP and employs more than

 88% of her labour force. Uganda also suffers from the unbalanced devel

 opment inherited from colonial legacy where most of the viable economic

 activities were established in the southern part; a situation sustained by the current

 insecurity in Northern and North Eastern Uganda.


-----

###### • Social Problems: There are many challenges to social cohesion in Uganda. The

 high degree of ethnic and religious diversity, the increasing gap between rich and

 poor, the rural urban divide, and the nature of gender relations can lead to social

 and political tensions. There is also the problem of HIV/AIDS epidemic which

 Uganda, like all other developing countries, has to grapple with.

 • Political: Finally, Uganda is a young state. Since gaining independence from the

 colonial rule in 1962, successive waves of political turmoil have undermined her

 social fabric, economic infrastructure and efforts to build democratic institutions

 that can channel political competition in non-violent ways.

 2.3.2 Nature of Security Threats

 Over the next 10-15 years, Uganda may expect to face a diverse range of threats to the security of the state and its people. These threats may be expected to manifest themselves in different ways depending upon the circumstances. The nationwide consultative proc­ ess carried out during the Defence Review identified 134 potential threats. These were grouped into 9 generic threat categories indicated in the box below.


**_Threat Categories._**

(i) **Border insecurity includes all threats that may involve breaching, or**

attempting to breach the borders of Uganda, e.g. smuggling; illegal crossings;

overt or covert invasions. The threat could manifest itself as common

transgressions and/or major illegal violations.

(ii) **Destabilizing external influences refer to threats whose source is outside Uganda,**

and which impact upon either the security of the state or her citizens. Such

threats could manifest into regular or irregular military activities and hostile political

and economic policies of other states towards Uganda.

(iii) **Political instability can be defined as tensions emanating from weak state**

institutions, poor governance, and political competition that disrupt the

functioning of government and the political process.

(iv) **Environmental stress and Resource constraints can degrade the natural**

environment and resource base of Uganda upon which livelihood of the formal

and informal economy depends, exacerbating competition over resources.

(v) **Human underdevelopment refers to conditions or factors that constrain or socially**

undermine human development effort in terms of health, education and access

to basic needs such as clean water, sanitation, and adequate shelter.


-----

(vi) **Internal insecurity comprises of a range of threats from common crime, banditry,**

political repression, armed insurgency to civil strife that impact upon the security

of the state and its citizens.

(vii) **Economic shocks and stress are threats to the productive capacity of Uganda.**

These include factors that undermine external trade relations, economic

development, fiscal stability, and the economic infrastructure that could ultimately

lead to economic collapse.

(viii) **Social polarization involves the breakdown of social cohesion due to the**

emergence of communal, religious and ethnic tensions, or mounting economic

disparities between social classes.

(ix) **Civil disaster refers to any occurrence, whether human-made or natural, that**

undermines the welfare of the population and requires an emergency response

by the civil authorities.


###### 2.3.3 Threat Assessment and Ranking

 From the nine threat categories, 24 specific security threats were derived as the most
 important. The 24 threats were identified based on the possibility of their occurrence in the context of the projected future scenarios. They were ranked according to the degree of probability for each threat occuring and subsequent impact on the security of Uganda if it did occur ( Detailed at Annex D) The detail has 24 threats:

 • The three top most threats relate to external factors i.e. full-scale invasion by a force of a
 foreign power, cross-border raids by smaller insurgency forces and major illegal movements
 of people such as refugees or criminal elements that could disrupt security. In this category
 also are destabilising external influences in the event that other countries adopt
 deliberate policies hostile to Uganda.

 • The next three threats are internal in nature and derive from political instability, civil
 disaster and internal insecurity. Each threats can have a direct and indirect impact on
 Uganda’s security. They could either undermine systems of national governance and
 social cohesion, thereby increasing political tensions,or could undermine the totality
 of “human security” in Uganda. These threats could manifest in different ways, each
 of which will require a different response.

 • The subsequent eight threats are deriving from non-traditional security aspects
 i.e.economic, environmental and social factors. These, also lead to problems that
 are related to social polarisation, human underdevelopment as well as economic shocks
 and stress. Whereas these threats have a direct and immediate impact on the welfare
 of the citizens, they also have a long-term and equally harmful impact on the political
 stability of the nation.


-----

- The final grouping of ten threats are derivatives of threat manifestations identified above.
e.g. the political instability resulting from warlordism.


-----

###### CHAPTER THREE – MEETING THE SECURITY CHALLENGES

 3.1 Introduction

 The diverse security threats and dilemmas that Uganda faces require diverse responses.
 This chapter examines the case for a comprehensive security strategy that integrates the
 foreign, development and security policies. The Review Process developed a Security Policy Framework that spells out the roles and responsibilities of the various government departments and agencies involved in the management of national security. This chapter examines the specific contribution that the Ministry of Defence can make to ensure Uganda’s security. It also highlights the main objectives of defence policy and the roles and missions of the defence forces.

 3.2 A Comprehensive Government Approach

 Uganda needs to develop a security policy based on an assessment of the factors that
 threaten national security interests. The approach to protecting national interests should
 be holistic and comprehensive, making use of all the policy instruments available to the
 Government including pro-active strategies to anticipate and prevent potential security
 problems from occuring.

 3.2.1 Integrating Development and Security

**_Vision 2025_**

###### Uganda’s vision is spelt out in ‘Vision 2025’ as: Prosperous People, Harmonious Nation, and Beautiful Country. The formulation of national aspirations as contained in the Vision was a logical follow up to the contextual analysis of Uganda’s past and present circumstances which underpin her development into the future. Among the strategies identified for achieving the vision, is deliberate evolution of a democratic society and the full observance of human rights through the building of strong institutions including Parliament, Judiciary, Executive, Public Service. 

 Poverty Eradication Action Plan

 On the development side, the national planning framework that provides the overall
 goal for government policies and programmes is contained in the Poverty Eradication
 Action Plan (PEAP) – which establishes the principles that guide the investment plans
 and the overall management of the economy. The key message of the PEAP is that “pro poor” economic growth is essential for poverty eradication hence National plans should
 focus on improving the livelihood of the poor who make up a significant portion of the
 population.

 While economic growth is a necessary condition for poverty reduction, the Government
 recognizes that poverty is a multi-dimensional problem which also depends on adequate


-----

###### security to provide the necessary environment for economic development. Good
 governance, peace and security to maintain that peace are essential in the promotion of
 effective and sustainable delivery of basic services. Access to social services, informa­ tion and skills is also critical as much as actions to improve people’s health and their
 knowledge about the world. The four pillars of the PEAP therefore include:

 1)  Rapid and sustainable economic growth and structural transformation

 2)  Good Governance and Security

 3)  Increased ability of the poor to raise their incomes

 4)  Enhanced quality of life of the poor

 The key factors that were identified by the PEAP working group that government should attend to, to reinforce security within the context of development are summarised in the box below: 


###### PEAP Factors
 The PEAP sector strategy on security identified the following key factors:

 • Allocation of adequate resources to defence;

 • Strengthening the UPDF by modernizing and professionalising;

 • Enhancement of the capacity of intelligence gathering bodies;

 • Creation of a Reserve Force, and boosting the LDUs;



###### • Creation and strengthening of collaboration between security forces and the other
 security stakeholders to resolve conflict and create sustainable peace; and,



###### • Strengthening the capacity of civil society to play a bigger role in peace creation


###### Approach to Establishing National Security Responses

 The following general principles guided the approach taken in developing national
 security responses:

 • Uganda will ensure a properly functioning Justice, Law and Order Sector based on a  police service that is accountable to the people and the efficient dispensation of justice.
 In addition, freedom of press, speech and association will be safeguarded.

 • Uganda will ensure regular, free and fair elections at national and local levels, in
  order to ascertain that the leadership is accountable to the people. The power to change
 the leadership will always reside with the people.

 • Government will continue to support capacity development within local
 governments to ensure that services are efficiently delivered nearer to the
 people in order to improve public perception and ownership of local political and admin
 istrative systems.


-----

###### • Building a professional Defence Force to secure Uganda against external threats
 and protect her sovereign interests, shall be pursued to its logical end.

 • Uganda will work towards a secure region, through participating in global and
 regional efforts aimed at improving security, building peace and resolving
 conflicts.

 • Uganda will continue to meet her regional and international obligations and proto cols.

 • Government recognises that certain social groups are vulnerable to disasters,
 including floods, drought and earthquakes, which can lead to loss of life and
 property or acute food shortages. Government will help communities and local author
 ities to cope better with humanitarian disasters. 

 Security and decision-making

 The review has helped in creating a clear understanding of the kinds of threats Uganda is likely to face in the future, and their potential impact upon the security of the nation. The threats are social, economic, environmental, political and military in nature, and also include the new security challenges such as organised crime and international ter­ rorism.

 Developing effective responses to all these threats require substantial resources of both
 human and financial nature. While the Government may wish to focus its attention and
 resources on threats that are more important in terms of their potential impact, it can not
 afford to disregard those with a lower ranking. Getting the right balance creates a number
 of decision-making dilemmas for the Government, for example:

 • Uganda should be able to react to sudden security challenges like insurgency
 and banditry without overlooking the need to strengthen preventive mechanisms.
 Government should allocate resources in such a way that the underlying causes of
 the threats, which include poverty, social polarization and political marginalisation are
 addressed.

 • Although Uganda has a number of key security actors, their effectiveness is limited
 by the available resources.

 Given the limited resources, should the Government invest in strengthening one
 particular institution like the Police, or should funds be allocated to all the other
 security related institutions to assist the police?


-----

###### These dilemmas need to be addressed by the Government as part of a comprehensive security strategy that includes strengthening national capacity for:

 •  assessing security needs,

 •  formulating policies,

 •  planning responses,

 •  implementing policies.

 Within the context of this Defence Review, this requirement was recognised and
 interdepartmental discussions were held in order to establish a set of collectively agreed
 upon working assumptions that have been articulated in the Security Policy Framework (SPF).

 The primary purpose of the Security Policy Framework was to help in the development of a common understanding of security problems that Uganda may face over the next 10- 15 years. The SPF remains a framework to assist government departments to discuss and co-ordinate security plans and responses to both military and non-military threats in the context of the National Security. The framework identifies which government departments and agencies have the lead responsibility, or merely some degree of involve­ ment, in dealing with specific threats. The SPF emphasises Uganda’s holistic approach to security, the need for security to be supportive of the wider national and development goals and the need to take into consideration the reciprocal existence of other security actors.

 National Security Council

 Uganda has made progress in terms of developing a framework for addressing its secu­ rity challenges. Among its achievements are the establishment of a National Security Council (NSC) through the National Security Council Act 12 of 2000. The Council, which is chaired by the President of Uganda, has a broad representation including the Ministries of Internal Affairs, Foreign Affairs, Defence, Security, Finance and the Attorney General. It also has representatives who are the heads of security organs like the UPDF, the Police, External Security Organisation, Internal Security Organisation, Special Branch, Military Intelligence and Security, Criminal Investigation Department and Prisons Department. 

 The National Security Council Act also made provisions for the establishment of District Security Committees and District Intelligence Committees in every district, as well as Sub-County Security Committees. The National Security Council needs strengthening to provide a mechanism of analysing Uganda’s security and addressing it in an integrated


-----

###### manner. There is also a need to develop a policy to guide the stake holder’s activities. The Council is mandated as the lead in terms of all decision-making that relates to the man­ agement of major security problems of both internal and external nature. The functions of the NSC are summarised below. 

 Functions of the National Security Council

 The Security Policy Framework provides an instrument for the National Security Council to broaden and strengthen its analysis of Uganda’s security problems and pos­ sible responses. The Council’s main functions currently include:

 • To inform and advise the President on matters relating to national security;

 • To co-ordinate and advise on policy matters relating to intelligence and security;

 • To review national security needs and goals;

 • To receive and act on reports from the Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC);

 • To carry out any other function as the parliament may oblige to the council

 The government needs to establish a fully staffed Secretariat to support the National Security Council and assist in coordinating the Policy and Planning function among its membership.

 For the NSC to be effective, it will require building the capacity of each of the relevant security actors, including Ministries responsible for fulfilling core security functions related to defence, diplomacy, policing, intelligence, interpreting the law, and rehabilita­ tion of criminals. Each of these actors require appropriate internally generated policies to guide their operations that specify their respective roles and responsibilities in dealing with security threats within the overall framework agreed by the NSC.

 3.2.3 Government Roles and Responsibilities

 Although the National Security Council has a formal role in coordinating the security response of the nation, the council is yet to put in place a comprehensive document that coordinates the planning of all security actors. The Defence Review therefore, undertook consultations across government in order to ensure that the role of defence is derived from the overall security framework such that there is an agreed position amongst the wider security stakeholders on each others’ roles. This process involved participation of


-----

###### government departments and agencies that play key roles in the management of broader security issues. 

 The under mentioned departments were identified as having a role in handling Security
 issues:

 a. Office of the President. This office exists to uphold the Constitution, sover­
 eignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Uganda. It is also responsible for the provision of leadership in the initiation, formulation and co-ordination and monitoring of public policies as well as ensuring Uganda’s positive international relations. It plays a lead role in addressing political instability, social polarization and is highly involved with other players in handling any security threats to Uganda.

 b. Office of the Prime Minister. It co-ordinates the implementation of govern­
 ment policies and is responsible for disaster management, refugees and pacification pro­ grammes. The office works together with other government departments and agencies to address threats arising out of border insecurity, political instability, human underdevel­ opment, internal insecurity and economic shocks.

 c. The Ministry of Defence through its arm; the UPDF, plays a lead role in
 responding to attacks from irregular and regular military bodies attacking Uganda from outside. The MOD also addresses internal threats in aid of Civil Authorities.

 d. The Ministry of Internal Affairs. It is responsible for the maintenance of peace,
 law and public order. It is also responsible for immigration and emigration of people. The Ministry plays a lead role in addressing threats of border and internal security. It also works closely with other government departments to address external threats, envi­ ronment–based threats, political instability, human under–development, civil disasters, economic shocks and social related threats.

 e. The Department of State for Security (DMSS), attached to Office of the
 President, plays a key role in coordinating national security issues. It coordinates an early warning system, based on reliable information, to help government departments and agencies plan pro-actively to curtail potential threats to the State and her citizens. The department does not play any lead role in addressing any specific threat but has significant levels of involvement with other stakeholders in handling security threats.


-----

###### f.  The Ministry of Foreign Affairs. This ministry leads in monitoring and coordinat­
 ing Uganda’s foreign interests. The ministry leads in responding to any hostile policies by other countries. It takes a lead role in solving conflicts using the diplomatic approach and is also involved in addressing threats related to border insecurity, political instability, envi­ ronmental threats, civil disasters and economic related dangers.

 g. The Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development.

 It promotes economic development and ensures macro-economic stability and

 efficient allocation of national resources to meet Uganda’s strategic objectives. The

 Ministry’s key role in the management of security is to ensure enough resources

 to finance security and defence activities. It has a lead role to play in managing

 economic shocks and poverty issues that may give rise to insecurity. The Ministry

 is also concerned with wider issues relating to the environment, human develop

 ment, and civil disasters.

 h. The key contribution of the Ministry of Justice and Constitutional Affairs is to

 ensure sustained constitutionalism in Uganda. The Ministry ensures that dif

 ferences are resolved in courts of law and that all citizens are given fair hearing

 once in the Courts of Law. The Ministry ensures law, order and public safety so

 as to create a safe environment for social and economic activities.

 i. The Ministry of Local Government has a lead role to play in responding to civil

 disasters which are localized in nature and are not major. The Ministry also

 works in conjunction with other stakeholders in addressing threats that fall in

 its area of responsibility, including border insecurity, human underdevelopment,

 internal disorder, economic shocks, and social polarisation.

 j. Other Government Departments.

 (i) The Ministry of Education and Sports is charged with moulding patriotic,

 nationalistic and law-abiding citizens.

 (ii) The Ministry of Gender, Labour and Social Development leads in the

 social development areas and stability.

 (iii) The Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industries and Fisheries intervenes

 in mitigations against hunger, poverty and other human survival needs.

 (iv) The Ministry of Lands, Water and Environment intervenes in monitoring

 and preserving key natural resources and environment that are likely to

 trigger wars with other nations; or between the local populations which

 use riparian rights.

 (v) The Ministry of Tourism Trade and Industry plays a key role in the

 security of the Tourism Industry.


-----

###### 3.3 Security and the Constitution

 Article 209 of the Constitution of Uganda spells out the primary functions of the UPDF
 which are to:

 a. Preserve and defend the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Uganda.

 b. Co-operate with civil authority in emergency situations and in case of natural

 disasters.

 c. Foster harmony and understanding between the defence forces and civilians.

 d. Engage in productive activities for the development of Uganda.

 3.3.1 Foreign Policy

 The objective of Uganda’s foreign policy is to contribute to national security, economic
 welfare and the prosperity of the people and the nation. Uganda’s foreign policy,
 security and diplomatic strategy are shaped by the guiding principles contained
 in the Constitution and the various international agreements and conventions
 to which Uganda is party. (See Annex F).

 3.3.2 Contribution of Defence to Uganda’s Security

 The Security Policy Framework places Defence alongside other approaches in dealing
 with security. In broad terms, Uganda will seek for non-military solutions to prevent any
 threats whilst remaining prepared to use military force if needed. The defence policy
 objectives are summarised in the box below.


**_Defence Policy Objectives_**

In view of the above constitutional mandate, the foreign policy objectives and national
security interests; the objectives of the defence policy are to defend the
sovereignty and territorial integrity of Uganda through:

**» Building adequate and credible defence capacity to address both internal and external**

security threats.

**» Creating a productive and self sustaining force.**

**» Ensuring adherence to and furtherance of our international obligations.**

**» Ensuring continuation and strengthening of the legacy of a people’s army that**

has respect for the rights of the people.

**» Creating military alliances to enhance regional security and stability.**

**» Maintaining national cohesion.**


-----

**»** Promoting cooperation with the East African countries which share common

political, economic, social, cultural values and interests; and recognises regional

integration through the East African Community and African Union as key to the

defence of Uganda.

**»** Supporting regional and continental integration through the African Union (AU).


###### 3.3.3 Defence Roles and Missions

 The Uganda Peoples’s Defence Forces should play a major role in combating the follow­ ing security threat categories:

 (a) Border Insecurity - covers a wide range of threats including all those that may

 involve breaching or attempting to breach Uganda’s Borders e.g. smuggling, illegal

 crossing and covert or overt invasions.

 (b) Internal Insecurity-threats encompass terrorism, insurgency and political

 instability arising from such sources like human under-development, social

 dysfunctions and tensions.

 (c) External Insecurity - threats in this description encompass any activity by a foreign

 force that negatively affects Uganda’s territory, interests and her peoples.

 (d) Civil Emergency - the main threat in this area is civil disaster, whether natural or

 man-made, potentially requiring the military to assist in a wide range of areas

 including rescue and logistic support.

 (e) Technological capability of other countries - as a threat it accounts for the possible

 development of nuclear, biological, chemical and information technology or any

 other technical development that might be turned into a threat to Uganda’s

 security.

 To perform its roles, the UPDF defence objectives have been synthesised into six core
 missions below:

 (a) Ensuring the Defence of the country and the Constitution of Uganda that 
 encapsulates peoples’ sovereignty through popular will. One of the missions

 of the Defence Forces is to defend the country, the people’s constitution and 
 its sovereignty. It is this popular will of the people that provides the benchmark

 of the current political and military behaviour.


-----

###### (b) Assisting with Peacetime Security. The fight against internal insurgency and

 terrorism of all kinds will remain of high priority whenever they manifest. Whilst

 it is vital that Uganda’s Defence Forces has the capability to deal with current

 problems, they should of necessity prepare to deal with future challenges in this

 area.

 (c) Contributing to Regional Stability The greatest risk to Uganda’s

 national economic and political interests lies in the potential instabil

 ity in the region. The situation on the Northern and Western borders has in the past

 continued being affected by the above factors. Indeed, there is

 no guarantee that the above scenario may not arise again

 or elsewhere. Any of the countries in the region may suffer some

 degree of instability, at worst leading to a power hostile to Uganda. Whilst the

 pursuit of other defence missions may prevent these circumstances from arising, it

 remains the first duty of the state to provide for its own security, and that of its

 citizens.

 (d) Provision of Support to the Civil Authorities. As Uganda seeks to improve its

 current position, the Defence Forces should provide support to the civil

 community at times of civil emergency. It is envisaged that the scope of this

 support may extend from nationally recognized support in a civil disaster,

 to the provision of logistics not readily available to the civil authorities,

 such as the use of support helicopters for search and rescue or medical

 evacuation of civilians. The aim should be providing humanitarian

 support to the population to foster harmony and understanding between

 the Defence Forces and civilians.

 (e) Conducting Defence Diplomacy. The growth of ties within the region,

 principally with members of the East African Community (EAC),

 is to be encouraged as a means of promoting broader understanding

 between the region’s Defence Forces. Although it is envisaged

 that with time, there will be a high degree of military

 integration, it is anticipated that this will take the form of exchange of observers,

 conducting joint military exercises and joint training. The intention will be to

 improve the effectiveness of the existing activities and efforts in all these

 areas in order to promote the desired integration.

 (f) Support to International Obligations. The Uganda Peoples’ Defence Forces

 must be prepared to deploy in support of international peace support operations in

 furtherance of the wider national interests and foreign policy. It is this prong of

 security/defence engagement that takes cognisance of global human security and

 mutual vulnerability of communities beyond Uganda’s national borders.

###### CHAPTER FOUR – UGANDA’S VISION FOR DEFENCE

 4.1 Introduction
 The objective of defence transformation is to create a national defence capability that
 can achieve the defence missions described in the section above. Uganda’s vision for
 defence transformation is based on two pillars.

 •  a modern and professional defence force; and,

 •  A strong civil-defence partnership.

 This chapter looks at each of these pillars. It first examines the specific operational
 requirements of the defence forces, including the size of defence forces, and how they
 should be structured. The chapter then examines the nature of partnership required
 between the military, the civil authorities and the civilian population in order to foster the
 role of defence in national development.

 4.2  Modern and Professional Defence Forces

 4.2.1 Current Organisation of UPDF

 Currently UPDF is organized as a single service force of about 55,000 officers and men
 formed into five Infantry Divisions, backed by Combat Support, including air support,
 and Combat Service Support. The UPDF does not have a formal reserve force. The regular
 force is currently supported by a number of Auxiliary Forces, including local militia/
 Home Guards and Local Defence Units (LDUs) that have been formed at the district
 level to meet some of the regional security requirements. A key focus for the Defence
 Review was to assess whether the current force has the capability to meet the Defence
 Missions which were clearly defined in the wider context of security.

 4.2.2 Force Capability Requirements

 The analysis also addressed a number of areas that have, from experience, been identified as lacking. These are summarised in the box below.


**_a._** **_Deficiencies in Military Capability_**

  - Land Forces Mobility

  - Deployment i.e. the ability to timely deploy forces both within and outside the

national borders


-----

  - Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance

(ISTAR).

  - Command, Control, Communication and Information Systems (C3IS)

  - Employment of Air Power.

  - Ability to patrol territorial waters

  - Firepower

  - Training and Doctrine

  - Sustainability

_b._ _Current Deficiencies in the Defence Management_

  - Human Resource Management and Welfare

  - Logistics Management and Procurement

  - Financial Management and Budgeting

  - Policy and Planning

  - Civil- Military Relations

  - Information Technology Systems


**_4.2.3_** **_Challenges of building an Appropriate Force Capability_**

###### The Defence Review assessed the cost of achieving the Vision Force and was estimated
 at Ushs. 5.4 trillion which is approximately 18 times the current Defence Budget. This
 cost would be incurred in transforming the Defence Forces from the current to the
 desired position. Given Uganda’s current revenue collections, the level of spending
 necessary to achieve this vision force is unlikely to be attained in the Medium Term. It is
 always a challenge for a nation to correctly determine the balance of resources that should
 be applied to defend against the risk of defeat at some time in the future. This is illustrated
 at Figure 1 which shows that for a given Defence Mission the military pressure will be for
 a large force that gives minimal risk of failure. However, such a force will be costly, and
 the financial pressure will be to reduce the size of the force to a point at which it is affordable
 and the level of risk is judged acceptable. In the case of Uganda, the Uganda Peoples’
 Defence Forces are the key insurance against the unexpected. Skimping on the premium
 can lead to the payment of a very heavy price. At the same time, the luxury of having
 additional forces for “just in case” is not affordable. Thus, the Government of Uganda
 had to find a balance between developing a level of force capability that can adequately
 deal with threats at an acceptable level of risk and an affordable cost.


-----

###### Figure 1 - Finding the Right Balance of Fighting Power

 In order to assist in judging this balance, government has set the following broad
 benchmarks for the scale of planning: 

 • Current operational commitments must continue to be met.

 • There must be a sufficient standing Military Capability in order to deter, but if

 necessary deal with, any likely transgression of Uganda’s national borders

 effectively and decisively.

 • The defence should be able to respond to internal security threats by providing

 appropriate support to the police and civil authorities and ensuring that the

 structures and organisation of the Defence Forces provide for close co-ordination

 with local authorities.

 • The force should be able to undertake limited deployments outside Uganda in

 support of its international obligations and regional security initiatives.

 • It should be able to conduct concurrent or simultaneous operations in different

 areas of the country or region at any given time without undermining national

 security.

 • Uganda should be able to build adequate forces to meet a longer and more

 sustained internal or external threat to the security of Uganda. 

 However, it is important to note that effective military capability rests upon well-trained,
 equipped and motivated defence forces together with well-functioning supporting
 systems and structures for formulating, executing, managing and monitoring the defence
 policy. In addition to ensuring that there is adequate Military Capability to deliver the


-----

###### required military force when and where it is needed, there is a core requirement to
 strengthen the overall institutional framework that governs defence as part of the task of
 modernising and professionalising Uganda’s defence forces. 

 4.2.4 Operational Requirements

 The UPDF’s operational requirements have been derived from the Defence Missions
 contained in the Defence Policy. Four Strategic Force Options presenting different sizes
 of the force were identified. Based on the assessment of the advantages and disadvantages
 of each option, the appropriate option in the box below was  considered to be the most
 suitable for Uganda.


**_Appropriate Option_**

This option consists of 4 Infantry Divisions, 1 Armoured Brigade, 1 Air Defence Division,

1 Artillery Division, 1 Engineering Brigade, 1 Marine Battalion, 1 Military Police Battalion,

1 Signal Brigade, Air Force, 1 Service Battalion, and 3 field hospitals. This force, which

numbers about 48,000 personnel, will be supplemented with 45,000 Reserves.


###### In addition, a number of key areas for force development have been identified:

 a. Appropriately trained, equipped and motivated forces. This is the need to

 ensure that a soldier is appropriately equipped and trained on the equipment.

 b. Mobility, the capability to move forces safely and quickly, with their equipment,

 in response to changing tactical circumstances.

 c. Deployment, the ability to deliver forces to the required place in the right 
 time.

 d. Firepower, the ability to embed sufficient firepower in the infantry battalion

 and for adequate air and artillery support to formations.

 e. Sustainability, the ability to adequately sustain:

 (1)  An individual with medical and welfare support while on operations;

 and,

 (2)  A force, with sufficient supplies and maintain its equipment.

 f. Command, Control and Communication (C3), the need to ensure that troops are

 well led and their actions coordinated at all levels within the fighting doctrine.

 g. Intelligence and Information Requirements, the need for integrated information

 gathering, processing and dissemination.

 h. Auxiliary and Reserve Forces, the need to co-ordinate their role within a

 professional military structure and to “make operational” the concept of their

 training and level of readiness.


-----

###### 4.2.5 Force Structures

 Uganda Peoples’ Defence Forces will be divided into two services backed by a Reserve
 Force. The responsibilities of these services shall be synchronised and harmonised by an integrated Ministry of Defence Headquarters. The integrated structures and processes shall cater for the externalisation of the defence policy, planning and management into the wider government and society.

 a. Land Forces

 The Land Forces should be robust enough to detect and deter any potential aggression from across the national borders and will also be able to act in support of the police and civil authority in dealing with internal insecurity. They will have the responsibility of protecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Uganda on land and waters. They will be composed of the specialised combat support elements and the Marines.

 b. Air Force

 The Air force will have the responsibility of protecting the sovereignty and territorial
 integrity of Uganda’s airspace. It should have the ability and agility to intercept any aerial
 incursion into Uganda’s airspace that threatens the nation’s people and their property.
 The Air Force must also be able to support other forces by providing air cover during
 battle confrontations, airlift support services and supplies as well as interdiction.

 c. National Reserve Force

 The role of the reserves will be to support the defence forces in operations. The Reserve Forces will include formed units and individuals that can meet this remit. However, in time of national emergency, it may be necessary to bring all forces involved in secu­ rity under a single unified military command. This category of reserve should not be considered as part of those reserve forces allocated to the reinforcement of the regular units in order to avoid undermining the capacity of other security organs. All reservists, whatever their role, need to be properly organised, trained and adequately maintained to be able to perform different military roles as need arises. Although the UPDF Bill provides a formal framework for these categories, the concept of formed reserve units is yet to be operationalised. Uganda has relied on Veterans, Local Defence Units, militias and vigilantes to support the UPDF’s fighting capability in dealing with some threats. The need for auxiliary forces will diminish as the reserve concept is made operational.

###### Reserve Force Concept

 The reservists contributing to regular units will have clear roles within the operational
 structures of the regular forces. The organisation of the Reserve Forces will be based upon
 a number of Company size elements each of which shall be stationed at a Sub-County.
 The size of the Reserve Forces that will support the regular forces will be determined by a
 number of factors such as the ability to deal with standing commitments and the time
 that may be necessary to mobilise the reserves. Although the full strength of the reserves
 might be achieved within five years, there will be a need to review progress in this area
 as it develops so that the reserves are eventually seen as a professional adjunct to the
 regular force. The programme for achieving this level of reserve force will require careful
 consideration in order to ensure that resources used in this area provide the right level of
 fighting power for the force as a whole in the short to medium term.

 d. A Strong Civil - Military Partnership

 In 1981, the National Resistance Movement and National Resistance Army started the
 processes of mobilizing popular support to resist an anti-people military culture and
 political misuse of defence forces. This process has so far resulted in a number of reform
 initiatives aiming at enhancing a strong civil -military partnership. The most significant
 of these initiatives was the promulgation of the 1995 Constitution that provides a
 framework for governing defence and strengthening the civil-military partnership. This
 partnership is a key pillar of national defence. It provides a strong basis for enhancing
 accountability, efficiency and effectiveness of the defence forces within a framework of a
 democratic society.

 The following principles below underpin a strong civil -military partnership:

 • Making the military and civil - society assume a democratic interface

 • Mutual respect, trust and the establishment of a clear hierarchy of authority between   civil bodies and the defence forces. 

 • Promotion of ethical and professional management, culture and practices and contrib  uting to the general discipline of the defence forces.

 • Ensuring that the public can gain appropriate access to information about the
 defence forces.


-----

###### 4.3.1 Constitutional Framework

 The Constitution of Uganda provides for a strong, positive and mutually-beneficial civil military partnership. This partnership is based on the understanding that the State
 employs the defence forces on behalf of the Ugandan citizens who are the tax-payers,
 and that the defence forces ultimately owe loyalty to the State and the people. The
 Constitution defines how the defence forces relate both to the civil authorities and to the
 people. Article 208 of the Constitution affirms that UPDF shall only recruit Ugandan
 citizens of good character and prescribes the character and nature of the defence forces
 as non-partisan, patriotic, professional, disciplined, productive and subordinate to the
 civil authority. 

 The Defence Review identified two specific areas which the reforms must address: the
 relationship between;

 (i) military and the civil authorities

 (ii) military and the people

 4.3.2 Relationship between Military and the Civil Authority

 The underlying concept in this relationship is that the defence forces accept to serve the
 Ugandan society. Thus, if there is a flaw within the civil-military relations, it means that
 allegiance is compromised and consequently the defence forces put themselves outside
 and above those who serve the nation in politics, and or government.

 The defence forces and the civil authority should interact through legal and constitutional
 channels. Just as the military should not use their official positions to get involved in
 partisan politics, the civil political elite should not interfere in military operational matters
 and the military chain of command. Respect for this principle will help to avoid situations
 where the military oversteps their legitimate authority and political elites use the defence
 forces to gain partisan advantages over other political elites.

 The key relationships between the defence forces and the civil authorities which specify
 the hierarchy of authority are as follows:

 • The President is the Supreme Commander of the Uganda Peoples’ Defence Forces
 and is also mandated to provide overall policy guidance to the Ministry of Defence.
 Article 99 of the Constitution vests in the Presidency the responsibility to uphold
 and safeguard the constitution and laws of Uganda, to promote the welfare of


-----

###### the citizens and protect the territorial integrity. The President may by law delegate
 such responsibility where it relates to defence and security matters to the Minister
 of Defence and the Minister in charge of Security, respectively.

 • The Minister of Defence is responsible for linking the Ministry of Defence and
 Uganda Peoples’ Defence Forces with other Ministries and government agencies,
 and is answerable to Parliament for the Uganda Peoples’ Defence Forces

 • The Chief of Defence Forces reports to the Commander-in-Chief on matters of
 command and control and to the Minister on day-to-day administrative and policy
 matters.

 • Parliament is vested with the authority of ensuring civil oversight of the defence
 forces. It also exercises its oversight role by enacting laws that regulate the activities
 of the Uganda Defence Forces, including its organs and structures that manage issues
 like recruitment, appointment and promotion, terms and conditions of service,
 and the deployment of troops outside Uganda. The parliament through the Public
 Accounts Committee oversees matters of public funds and reports on the public
 accounts of all Government bodies established by Acts of Parliament, including
 the Ministry of Defence.

 • The Auditor General under article 163 of the Constitution is empowered to audit
 and report on the Public Accounts of Uganda and all public offices, and any
 public corporation or other bodies or organisations established by Acts of Parliament
 including Ministry of Defence.

 • The Inspector General of Government under article 223 is mandated by the
 Constitution to enforce the leadership Code of Conduct and investigate cases of
 corruption in all government departments including the Ministry of Defence.

 • The Human Rights Commission, as created under Articles 51 of the Constitution,
 is mandated to check all human right abuses including violation of human rights
 during military operations. The UPDF are constitutionally required to be subject to
 scrutiny by the Uganda Human Rights Commission (UHRC). Article 20 of
 the Constitution establishes the rights of an individual as inherent and not state
 granted and must be upheld and promoted by all government organs, agencies and all
 persons including the defence forces.

 4.3.3 Relationship between Military and the people

 The development of a positive and mutually reinforcing relationship between the
 population and military is central to ensuring that the defence forces are responsive to
 the needs of society. A good civil-military relationship strengthens the effectiveness of the UPDF. The UPDF and the population should therefore work towards building mutual support and respect.


-----

###### A strong civil-military partnership will be based upon a set of reciprocal and mutually
 reinforcing principles indicated in the box below.


**_Key Tenets of the Civil-Military Partnership_**

###### What the citizens of Uganda expect of their defence forces:

  - Demonstration of professional competence that measures up to the task of

defending the nation, the people and their property

  - Appreciation and respect for the democratic political process and basic human

rights

  - Awareness that, as an institution, the defence forces are accountable to the people.

  - A commitment not to get involved in partisan politics lest their neutrality is

compromised.

  - A commitment to place the people’s interest over and above those of the defence

forces.

###### What the defence forces expect of the people of Uganda:

  - An understanding of the military roles and obligations.

  - An appreciation of the need for appropriate remuneration for the sacrifice made

by the military.

  - Support for a meritorious culture of service rather than one based on ascription.

  - Support for a peaceful and democratic change of government that will allow the

military a security of tenure.

  - Assistance with the transition process from military service back to civilian life.

##### CHAPTER FIVE - DEFENCE TRANSFORMATION PRIORITIES

###### 5.1 Introduction

 Defence transformation is a long-term undertaking that will involve changes in the way Uganda’s defence forces are organized, equipped and managed. The changes will involve building basic human capacities, changing mind-sets and working practices
 and strengthening organizational structures. This requires sufficient financial and human
 resources as well as a climate conducive to institutional change. These changes cannot be
 accomplished overnight because of the extensive needs, hence government must prioritise.
 The transformation requirements have been categorised into operational and non operational areas.

 5.2 Transformation Areas

 As the government of Uganda restructures the Uganda People’s Defence Forces to meet
 the challenges of the future, the Defence Review identified a number of transformation
 priorities which deal with improvement in the operational and non-operational areas.

 5.2.1 Operational Themes:

 These are approaches employed to achieve the required military capability. They include:

 a. Appropriately Trained, Equipped and prepared for combat and peace

 support operations

 Focus should be put on a soldier so that he/she can play a part as a professional individual
 within a modernized force. Training the military force is a pre-requisite for making the
 force fit for operations and to enable the force fight effectively and efficiently. The force comprises of individuals who must be equipped with skills to enable them to survive and fight as individuals in operations. However, the individuals must work as teams, to ensure they work in harmony in operating fighting equipment. Finally, all of those teams must be able to operate collectively to produce the level of military capability required. To master each of these three areas of training, there is a need to keep fully abreast with the latest development in tactics, technology, administration and doctrine to ensure that new skills and techniques are acquired.


-----

###### As Uganda develops and modernizes her defence forces, it is likely that she will be called upon with greater frequency, to participate in peace support operations, under the man­ date of either regional or international organizations, such as the African Union, or the United Nations. In order to fulfil their peace support responsibilities, Uganda’s defence forces will require appropriate training in peace support operations.

 b. Deployability

 Implies the ability to deliver forces to the required place in the right time.
 This is of particular concern to Uganda. To be able to deploy and sustain the
 forces, particularly over long distances, requires a flexible and adaptable mix of
 land and airlift capabilities. Being able to bring forces to bear, when they are
 most needed, is dependent on deployability.

 c. Sustainability and Logistics Support

 Refers to the ability to sustain the Defence Forces with adequate support
 services. The logistic concept pertains to the integration of strategic, operational
 and tactical sustainance in order to support the forces in their missions
 and tasks. The emphasis should be on scheduling the mobilization and
 deployment of units, personnel, equipment and supplies in support of the
 employment concept, particularly the ability to adequately sustain:

 (i)  The individual, given deficiencies in medical and welfare support on

 operations; and,

 (ii) The force, given deficiencies in ensuring its efficient supply and

 maintenance of its equipment.

 d. Joint/Combined Operations.

 This pertains to the ability to train and plan for Joint and Combined Operations. Whereas Joint operations refer to those operations in which two or more nations par­ ticipate, in combined operations refer to the employment of the Land, Marine, Air and Special Forces during operations.

 As the Uganda Peoples’ Defence Forces moves to a multi-service force, having capability to undertake both joint operations and combined operation, these factors will shape the training approach and conducting training operations, and the way UPDF is managed. This means that there should be joint ways of working, or (doctrine); training of staff on how to employ joint forces; practising joint working; and having a headquarter able to command and control joint operations. The Senior Command and Staff College should work towards developing the capacity that will enable this to happen.


-----

###### e. Technology and Doctrine

 It is essential that the Uganda Peoples’ Defence Forces keep abreast with technologi­ cal and other changes in military operations. The Information Technology Unit should coordinate the introduction of IT support systems to the different functional areas. The IT unit should provide technical support to such systems as: human resource, policy and planning, financial management, Procurement management, and general stock and asset management. The government, through its department for industrial development, should support the Defence Industries, research and inventions of kinds to support Uganda’s Security.

 The Military Doctrine unifies the UPDF approach to operations and the general con­ duct of affairs in the execution of its missions. Military Doctrine also seeks to influ­ ence the way in which the UPDF personnel think. It also determines the framework of understanding the approach to warfare. It is therefore not a set of rules but a guideline that provides direction, and an aid to operational concepts.

 It is imperative that a Doctrine unit is set up within the MOD/UPDF headquarters with the purpose of capturing the current military doctrine and customising it into UPDF’s situation. However, the Senoir Command and Staff College, which is directly located in the MOD will play a supportive role in this area.

 The above priorities in the operational aspects of military provide the information needed for an affordable and practical plan, for the transformation force, to be developed.

**_5.2.2  Non-Operational Themes:_**

###### These are approaches that support the Military Capability needed to achieve
 the defence missions. They include structures and systems aimed at planning the use of
 resources, coordinating activities in the plan, and ensuring that the required level
 of military capability is built, efficiently and effectively delivered within a legal
 framework.These approaches also deal with the management principles that stipulate   accountability of the military to the civil authority. These include:

 a Policy and Planning

 The outcome of the Defence Review and the Defence Policy,

 must be regularly reviewed to ensure that they remain relevant in the changing
 circumstances. A policy and planning department should be set up within the
 MOD/UPDF headquarters and be responsible for reviewing the strategic development plan and coordinating policy formulation.


-----

###### b. Financial Management

 It is essential that the financial resources allocated to the Ministry of
 Defence in the budget be used rationally to maximize the attainment of Military
 Capability. The strategic goal for this area is to improve financial management and
 budgetary processes so that resources are allocated and utilised in such a way that
 defence requirements are met in the most cost-effective manner. The aim is to
 have an efficient financial management system, which ensures that there is appro
 priate control and oversight, in line with wider public sector procedures. There are
 three key activities:

 • The first reform activity is to strengthen the accounting function through such

 measures as the recruitment of professionally qualified accountants and the

 introduction of a robust Integrated Financial Management System (IFMS).

 • The second activity is to strengthen the auditing function following the

 introduction of the IFMS in the Ministry of Defence. This will be accomplished

 through adoption of the Integrated Financial Management System being

 introduced by government. The Ministry also will ensure that the relevant

 financial and accounting staff are equipped with the necessary skills to man and

 use the IFMS. There will also be need to increase the number of accounting and

 auditing personnel who will be responsible for checking compliance and

 identifying inefficiencies that may need to be addressed, the provision of training,

 and the development of revised procedures and associated manuals.

 •  The third activity is to strengthen the budget function in line with the

 implementation of the budget Act within Defence. This will include, over time,

 decentralisation of the budget function, vote-holders and lower units being given

 more responsibility to determine the use of funds and prepare budgets, the

 appointment of finance officers at appropriate levels in the structure of defence,

 the development of manuals and of appropriate links with the planning func 
 tion. 

 c Logistics, Procurement and Infrastructure

 Within the framework of established processes, the Ministry of Defence must ensure more efficiency in the areas of:

 •  Acquisition of equipment.

 •  Maintenance of equipment.


-----

###### •  Purchase and supply of stocks

 •  Provision of barracks, training facilities and other infrastructure.

 The strategic goals in this area are to enhance defence capability by acquiring equipment that is appropriate and affordable; and by ensuring the effective delivery of logistics sup­ port to units in terms of time, cost effectiveness and performance; and, by improving infrastructure facilities, particularly barracks for service personnel. Three key areas of improvement have been identified.

 The first area will be to address weaknesses in procurement by implementing the
 provisions of the Public Procurement and Disposal of Public Assets Act 2003. This involves revising roles and responsibilities as well as introducing new processes and sys­ tems that shall also address the issue of specifying the right equipment and materiel, procuring and delivering it in the required time. 

 The second area is concerned with improving specific alements in the logistics function,
 i.e the:

 • management of operational and non-operational vehicles

 • Supply and storage:

 • control of petrol, oil and lubricants

 • distribution of rations

 • provision of personal equipment

 • Provision of recovery, repair and maintenance facilities.

 • Provision of medical services support.

 The third area is the provision of barracks infrastructure to a good standard. This does not only cover offices and other working areas but also messes, canteens and liv­ ing accommodation for both married and single soldiers. For the individual soldier,
 infrastructure is the most important facility.

 d. Human Resource and Welfare

 The personnel are the most single important resource for the Defence Forces. They must therefore be appropriately trained, well motivated and commited to the defence of their country. To have morale, the troops’ welfare and that of their families must be given high priority. The Terms and Conditions of Service of all servicemen/women should be reviewed, improved as necessary, and adhered to.


-----

###### e.  Information Technology (IT) Systems

 The strategic goal in this area is to ensure that data and processed information is pro­ vided to decision makers in an efficient and timely manner so that the decisions made are backed up by reliable information and therefore are effective. There are two key reform activities:

 The first is to develop a central IT function in the MOD/UPDF HQ. This unit will be responsible for developing a sector wide IT policy; co-ordinating the Local Area Network at the MOD/UPDF HQ; the introduction of Local Area Networks at the dif­ ferent UPDF locations; and, the establishment of a Wide Area Network.

 The second is to introduce IT support systems to the different functional areas. The cen­ tral IT unit would also provide technical support once the systems have been introduced and coordinate it.

 5.2.3 Cross-cutting areas

 Defence Management encompasses the following cross-cutting and inter-dependent areas of focus.

 a) Roles and Responsibilities

 The strategic goal in this area of transformation is to clarify roles and responsibilities within the defence sector, harmonise MOD/UPDF functions, and further integrate the
 defence sector into wider government policy, planning and management processes.
 Practically, this means that the initial focus will be on clarifying the roles and
 responsibilities of all stakeholders in the defence sector in order to develop an appropriate
 institutional framework.

 b) Legal Framework

 The goal is to ensure that the defence sector is effectively regulated by the Constitution and a Defence Act. The focus will be to streamline legislation governing the defence sector as provided for in the Constitution.


-----

###### c) Civil-Military Affairs

 The aim is to enhance mutual understanding between the Ugandan defence forces, their civilian counterparts in Government and the wider public to ensure that defence and society are mutually supportive. There reform activities associated with improving civil- military relations include:

 • Establishing Civil-Military Operation Centres in all areas of conflict, or by establishing
 sections within military units, which would be responsible for handling civil relations.
 Both civilian and military personnel would man the centres in order to ensure good
 cooperation.

 • Enhancing Public relations by strengthening the Public Relations Unit. The
 unit would be responsible for developing and maintaining a corporate web
 site and an internal website which would be used for improving both external
 and internal communications. At the same time a review of policy on release of
 information to the public will be undertaken with the aim of increasing the
 amount of information to be given out.

 • Creating an envivornment in which academic institutions, NGOs and other civil
 organisations can help to widen understanding of security and defence issues in order
 that there can be a more meaningful civilian – military interface.

###### CHAPTER SIX - STRATEGY FOR DEFENCE TRANSFORMATION

 6.1 Introduction

 This Chapter focuses on how Uganda will go about transforming her defence forces based
 on the overall vision outlined in Chapter Four and the Government priorities identified
 in Chapter Five. The Chapter emphasises the need for a multi-pronged approach that will
 facilitate the defence forces to address immediate security needs while laying the groundwork
 for long-term institutional changes. It highlights the specific challenges of ensuring
 sustained funding for this transformation. The Chapter also addresses a number of issues
 related to programming and implementing transformation, and the appropriate
 structures for coordinating the transformation activities.

 6.2 A Multi-Pronged Strategy

 The overall aim of the defence review was to assess the key security challenges that
 Uganda could face over the next 10-15 years, and determine how the roles, missions and
 capabilities of the UPDF have to be aligned to meet the challenges. Despite the above, the defence review, of necessity, took into account Uganda’s short-term security needs. Thus there is need for a proper mix and balance of activities to achieve short-term gains in defence capability and the long-term enhanced efficiency and effectiveness.

 While the defence transformation must be affordable, the Ministry of Defence will have to inrease efforts to tackle the problem of financial leakages, and to increase the efficiency of resource use in a number of areas. Nonetheless, it must be acknowledged that there are no easy wins in addressing these kinds of problems. Government must, of necessity, invest in strengthening defence institutions before substantial efficiencies are realized. See box below


###### Achieving Efficiencies in MOD will entail:

- Streamlining the payroll management in the UPDF.

- Streamlining procurement procedures in accordance with Public Procurement

and Disposal of Public Assets Act.

- Instituting effective and efficient procedures and systems for logistics and

supplies management.

- Instituting robust budgeting, financial management, audit and inspection

functions.

- Establishing and sustaining the right mix of regular and reserve forces.


-----

###### 6.3 Programming Defence Transformation

 Defence transformation is a complex process that calls for rational planning. Whereas the overall vision may be clear, the platform for transformation, including decisions on how to take forward the agreed recommendations, must be firmly instituted before any advanced activities are undertaken. There is also the need to ensure that the different strands of work are synchronised to deliver significant operational and non operational improvement. To meet the challenges in programming, priorities have been set to:

 a. accommodate enduring operational requirements;

 b. develop over time; and,

 c. be flexible within the overall defence transformation programme.

 This plan is composed of coherent ‘packages’. A package can be described as either a mix of manpower, equipment, training and the infrastructure needed, which taken together, forms a Military Capability, or a general programme of “cross cutting” improvement in a particular functional area. The aim of packaging is to allow room for choice as to when the package should be implemented based upon relative importance and cost.

 ‘Packages’ of Defence Capability.

 The aim of the “package’ is to provide flexibility of choice depending upon the relative importance of the package and its costs when viewed against operational priorities and financial considerations. This is vital in order to rationalise the resources e.g. not to procure equipment for which there are no people trained to use them or no facilities for trained people to be deployed. 

 6.4 Cost of Defence Transformation

 The armed forces, world over, are expensive to build and maintain. They require high investment to meet their expenditure needs which, more than often, are unaffordable in the short term. The Government, therefore, has opted for the approach that prioritizes the delivery of ‘Coherent packages’ of military capability. The UPDF will need to have the knowledge, training and communications to deliver the acquired capability, in terms of fire power, and sustainability that would ensure that the tempo of operations is fully supported.

 Prioritization of the packages is premised on ensuring that the defence forces are able to perform their tasks in dealing with the highest priority threats identified in the Security Policy Framework. The top six threats, for which the defence forces have either the lead or significant responsibility, relate to border security, internal security, and the provision


-----

###### of assistance to civil authorities in times of civil disaster. Based upon this analysis, the priorities for the first three years are summarized (refer to Annex H )

 6.5  Challenges to Sustainable Funding

 The Uganda defence budget process will seek to strengthen the links between the policy making, planning and budgeting. The process shall reflect strategic planning in light of the available resources for the entire Uganda public sector. It will also ensure rational resource allocation within and between defence functions, and ultimately the efficient and effective channelling of the resources in the defence sector. Uganda’s defence policy and planning process will continually rely on the broad evaluation of the country’s secu­ rity environment.

 The Ministry of Defence through the introduction of Result Oriented Management (ROM) and Output Oriented Budgeting (OOB) will carefully monitor and evaluate UPDF’s operational performance through strict commitment of appropriated funds to purposes intended.

 The Ministry will adopt functional financial management information systems to keep accurate data necessary for decision making in order to prevent divergences from the budget path.

 The Internal Audit Department will be extended to lower levels of the UPDF to guide on expenditure management.

 6.6 Coordinating the Defence Transformation

 Coordinating the Defence Transformation activities is a complex process, that in the short-run, will demand for a full time involvement of competent and skilled military and civilian personnel. Due to its complexity, the process calls for the development of an Institutional Strategy to facilitate the attainment of the objectives to modernisation the Defence Forces. The strategy will include a Secretariat to provide technical support to the departments /units implementing the defence reforms.

 In the first two to three years of implementing the reforms, a Defence Transformation Secretariat will work under the policy guidance of the Top Management Team. It will also work closely with the various departments where reforms will be taking place by providing coordinational support, while acting as a change agent to prepare the various departments to eventualy integrate reforms into their routine activities.


-----

###### The specific functions of the defence Transformation Secretariat will be to:

 a. Coordinate the implementation of the reforms recommended.

 b. Mobilise resources for implementation of the programs.

 c. Monitor and evaluate implementation of the programs.

 d. Prepare and present briefs to the Top Management Team.

 e. Act as Chair to the Reform Implementation Committee

 f. Organise workshops and seminars related to reforms.

 g. Periodically prepare, review and up-date the Corporate Plan.

 h. Receives accountabilities on performance of the reforms.

 i. Accounts for Resources utilised by the Secretariat.

 j. Prepare and update the Risk Log.


-----

###### CHAPTER SEVEN: THE WAY FORWARD

 The purpose of Uganda’s Defence Review was to reassess her central security interests and to examine how the roles and missions of the Defence forces need to be re-aligned to safeguard and enhance these interests.

 The White Paper on Defence Transformation represents Government’s vision for her defence forces. Translating this vision into a realistic programme for change, requires addressing the following key issues: 

 a. The Implementation plan - The vision for defence transformation contained in the White
 Paper will be translated into a comprehensive, costed Corporate Plan as the basis for
 implementation. The plan will be detailed enough to cover the activities within the first
 three years in order to provide meaningful outputs.

 b. Effective Transformation Secretariat - A successor body to the DRU will be formed immediately to act as the “Engine” of the reforms taking forward the imple­ mentation of the recommendations. The secretariat will be accountable for the program in the first three years, after which it is hoped that the Policy and Planning Department will have been built to take forward the activities of transformation.

 c. Gaining Wider support –Wide dissemination of the White Paper both within and outside government, accompanied by public debate, will be essential to inform stake­ holders about government plans for defence transformation and solicit support for imple­ mentation. These included:

 (i) Wider government

 (ii) Uganda’s citizens

 (iii) Uganda’s development partners

 d. Core stakeholders.  In order to translate the White Paper into a workable implementation
 plan, the development of the Corporate Plan will be a collective effort between the
 department heads and the Defence Reform Unit. This will provide an opportunity for all
 the key MOD/UPDF core staff to appreciate and own the strategic objectives of the Defence
 Transformation to generate all round and meaningful institutional change.

 e. Continuous Review. In view of the complexities in implementing the changes that have
 been identified, the Defence Transformation Programme must be regularly reviewed to
 ensure that it generates the expected benefits and remains relevant in a dynamic


-----

###### world. Although initial training will be provided to ensure that staff have fully internal­ ised the reviewed processes and the roles they are expected to play, there will be a con­ tinuing requirement for education and training as these processes and systems evolve.

 To ensure progress in a volatile environment is a challenge. There will be need to have clearer milestones, within an integrated corporate plan, spelling out what should be achieved by when, and a process of checking that quality standards are maintained against that plan. It is envisaged that all members within the Ministry of Defence will give collective support to the transformation efforts. However, the roles of the Inspectorate (Defence) and the Political Commissariat in guiding and overseeing the processes will be crucial in achieving this transformation.

 Lastly, once the highlighted premises are firmed up, the vision for a modern professional, efficient and accountable force will be in sight.


-----

###### ANNEX A:

**UGANDA’S MILITARY AND POLITICAL HISTORY**

###### As stated in the first chapter, the challenges that face Uganda today are a manifestation
 of its political and military history. Suffice to say, it is important to highlight some of these historical aspects that have had a direct bearing on the defence prospects of Uganda. At the onset of colonialism, Uganda was not a single political entity as is the case today, however, the people of Uganda were quite homogeneous or, at least, linked historically. There are four linguistic groups in Uganda: i.e the Bantu, the Nilotics, the Nilo-Hamatic and the Sudanic. There is evidence that the whole of western Uganda and much of Buganda were either governed together up to 1600 AD or were closely linked somehow during the dynasty of the Bachwezi, and during Bunyoro Kitara empire. There was clear interaction between the Bantu of Central and Western Uganda with the Acholi and Alur of Northern Uganda. It is a historical fact that the Karimojong and Iteso of Eastern Uganda had had a longer association with the southern and northern tribes of Uganda long before the on set of colonialism. Therefore, the notion that the peoples of Uganda are so different, that they had no homogeneities or linkages until the British came and put together an “artificial” unit known as Uganda, is untrue.

 By 1800 AD, the kinship groups of the Western, Eastern and Central Uganda with their new Luo relatives together with the Karimojong, Iteso and the Bagwere of Eastern Uganda were not governed together although they were linked. Indeed the successor kingdoms to the Bacwezi dynasty namely Buganda, Bunyoro and Nkore, were always in contact, sometimes allying and at others fighting among themselves. These same kingdoms also traded together. They were also linked with the chiefdoms of Busoga and Acholi and to a great extent the kingdoms of Rwanda, Karagwe and the chiefdoms of Bukoba in Tanzania. Nevertheless, they remained a constellation of kinship states. That is why (albeit belatedly) some of our kings (Mwanga and Kabalega), supported by the Langis came together to fight British colonialism.

 The political fragmentation and animosity experienced among these kinship groups, is, mainly, a result of colonial manipulation and ideological confusion of the African lead­ ers that assumed leadership at independence. All this was made worse by a pre-industrial economy that suffers from lack of horizontal linkages.

 The arising tensions must be contained in order to allow transformation to take place. Therefore, when identifying threats to our security and designing a defence response, Uganda’s historical background must be taken into account.


-----

###### Uganda has, over time, had to contend with problems of national unity and cohesion that have had a direct bearing on her military posture. The above challenge was further compounded by the nature and character of the colonial state, which was an oppressive one. It depended on a colonial army, which was not truly representative of Ugandan society, to enforce its will.

 The colonial army was anti-people. It was not an institution intended to protect the people’s rights, but rather, to implement the oppressive policies of the colonial masters. It was this colonial army, which was inherited at independence in 1962, based on an anti-people ideology and organized in a manner that would ensure the fulfillment of that ideology. With this heritage, the armies of successive regimes continued to support individual leaders against the established constitutional order. Since they were alienated from the people and were sectarian, they inflicted unimaginable suffering on the nation­ als they were supposed to safeguard.

 It is in light of the above, that we must appreciate the intermittent upheavals that have bedeviled Uganda as a country since independence.

 These upheavals shook the very foundation of the Ugandan State and it is in view of the above that the National Resistance Army (NRA) (Uganda Peoples’ Defence Forces, as it is now known), emerged to effect a qualitative change.

 The current Defence Forces have their roots in the pro-people Resistance Movements that have emerged over time. They are guided by a pro-people ideology, law and clear mission:

 “To defend and protect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Uganda, ensure the non-violability of the people’s rights and ensure the sovereignty and individual rights of the people, the rule of law and good governance”

###### ANNEX B:

 STAGES OF THE DEFENCE REVIEW

 The Defence Review was the first phase of the Uganda Defence Reform Programme and it consisted of ten stages: 

 Stage 1 of the Defence review comprised a number of activities associated with the launch of the Defence Review in June 2002.

 Stages 2-4 were the Strategic Security Assessment phase of the Review. The objective of this phase of work was to develop a broad understanding of the possible security threats that Uganda may face in the future (including military and non-military threats) and how the Government can address them most effectively. The key output of this phase was the Security Policy Framework Paper. In this paper roles of the respective depart­ ments and agencies in addressing Uganda’s security problems are outlined.

 The focus on Stage 5 was on producing a Defence Policy. This work was guided by the general analysis of security threats contained in the Security Policy Framework Paper that provided the basis for a more detailed focus on military threats and missions.

 Stage 6 work consisted of a more detailed assessment of defence requirements, focusing on the operational side. What size of the army does Uganda need? What kind of equip­ ment? How should the defence forces be organized? Where should they be deployed? For what roles should they train?

 Stage 7 examined the UPDF’s non-operational requirements. These relate to the legal framework that governs defence; roles and responsibilities of defence actors; civil-military affairs; policy and planning; financial management and budgeting; logistics, procure­ ment and infrastructure; human resource management and welfare; and information technology systems.

 The output of these two stages of work was a detailed assessment of defence require­ ments that was then costed to determine affordability. On the basis of the costing, a range of options for defence transformation was then developed during Stage 8 which were then presented to the Commander-in-Chief, Senior UPDF officers and Officials of the Ministry of Defence. A parallel strand of work focused on preparing the first draft of the Defence White Paper.


-----

###### Stage 9 was the decision-making phase during which Government and the UPDF considered the various options for defence transformation, assessed defence spending requirements, and reviewed the first draft of the White Paper.

 Stage 10 was the completion of the White Paper on Defence Transformation, which was formally presented and approved by the Cabinet and laid at table before Parliament. The Corporate Plan, to guide the implementation of the Defence Review, was subse­ quently compiled to reflect the major recommendations of the review process. 


-----

###### ANNEX C:

 DEFENCE REVIEW CONSULTATIVE PROCESS

 During the Defence Review process eight key security stakeholders were consulted:

 1. H.E the President

 At every stage of the defence review process, DRU presented its reports to H.E the President for guidance.

 2. Top Management Team (TMT)

 The TMT, including the Minister of Defence, Minister of State for Defence, Permanent Secretary, Army Commander and Chief of Staff, were briefed regularly on the process by the Director-General of the DRU. The TMT was the decision-making organ of the Defence Review programme and advised accordingly on the progress and direction of the process.

 3. MOD/UPDF

 Consultations were conducted at various levels:

 • Chiefs,Directors of the UPDF and MOD Departments Heads were consulted from
 the initial stages of the threat assessment through the preparation of the White Paper.
 Their inputs shaped the final conclusions of the Review process.

 • UPDF Formations were also consulted by the DRU during the threat assessment.

 4. Central government

 All key government departments and agencies with an interest in security matters, including the President’s, Prime Minister’s Offices, Minister of State for Security, Internal and External Security Organisations, Police, and Ministries of Finance, Foreign Affairs, Internal Affairs, Justice, Local Government and Public Service.

 5. Local Government

 Regional seminars were organized at the threat assessment stage to solicit the views of
 District officials, including District Chairpersons and their officials, RDCs, DISO, opinion
 leaders, and district elders.


-----

###### 6. Parliament

 The Chairpersons and Members of the Parliamentary Select Committees on Defence and Internal Affairs, Presidential and Foreign Affairs, and Finance were consulted at workshops convened during the threat assessment stage.

 7. Civil Society and Academia

 Civil Society groups and academia, (both in Kampala and at District levels) provided
 constructive inputs into the Defence Review. Three lecturers from Makerere University (Prof. Lakidi Ocaya, Dr. Elijah Mushemeza, Apuuli Kasaija) and the Vice- Chancellor of Nkumba University (Salongo Kajubi) worked with the DRU as Subject Matter Experts during the threat analysis. DRU solicited the views of NGOs involved in Human Rights Advocacy work,and those which address the interests of women, children, and disabled groups in conflict-affected regions of Uganda.

 8.  Uganda’s Development partners

 DRU provided regular briefings to members of the donor community either through informal discussions or formal donor round-table meetings organized by the European Union and World Bank, as well as through the British Department of Interntaional Development (DFID).
