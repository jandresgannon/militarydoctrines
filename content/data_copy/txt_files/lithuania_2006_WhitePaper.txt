###              FOREWORD

After we have published the last White Paper, two events of enormous historical importance took place: in

2004, after more than a decade of hard and dedicated work, Lithuania became a member of the North

Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) and the European Union (EU).

For a long time we have already been acting as true members of the Euro-Atlantic community. We have firmly

adhered to democratic principles while implementing reforms, have taken an active part in international

operations and confidence building measures, and have contributed to the spread of Euro-Atlantic stability.

In 2004, our achievements received due acknowledgment. Membership in NATO and the EU provided us an

opportunity to participate in the decision making process on Euro-Atlantic security matters and the collective

defence guarantees embedded in Article 5 of the Washington Treaty.

Collective defence guarantees also imply certain commitments to the Alliance. Membership in NATO brings

more security but also more challenges: our nation is now committed to ensure the security and welfare of our

Allies, just as our Allies will defend Lithuania. In an insecure world, there cannot be more intimate and

stronger bonds among sovereign states than that of a mutual commitment to defend freedom and other

common values.

The current security environment is fluid and changes rapidly, therefore we must constantly adapt the guidelines

of Lithuanian defence policy, foresee the challenges that lie ahead and find ways to overcome them. Membership

provides a firm foundation to develop relations with NATO Allies and EU member states, as well as with Partner

countries in other regions. Membership in NATO and the EU solidifies the image of Lithuania as an open society

that cherishes democratic values and is a credible partner for free trade and financial investment. Most importantly,

membership in NATO reinforces Lithuania’s readiness to deal with security challenges, and, if necessary, to

militarily confront these challenges together with Allied forces in defence of common values.

We must continue reforming the Lithuanian Armed Forces (LAF) and developing military capabilities in

accordance with the contemporary requirements and needs of NATO, in this way strengthening Lithuania’s

own defence. At the end of the day, we must make sure that the Lithuanian society could be proud of and

confident in its Armed Forces, and that our Armed Forces are well respected and trusted within the Alliance

and the international community.

Taking into account all these important, even historic changes in the life of Lithuanian state and the Lithuanian

Armed Forces, we are happy to present you a new Lithuanian Defence Policy White Paper.

Gediminas Kirkilas

### 1. CHANGING GLOBAL SECURITY ENVIRONMENT

In the beginning of the 21[st] century, contradictory strategic trends prevail in the world. On the one hand,

globalisation brings about many positive changes – strengthening international economic and political

cohesion, openness of foreign policy and economy of states, scientific and technological progress, and

growing international trade. On the other hand, globalization can also be blamed for the rise of new

transnational threats. Although the probability of a major inter-state war is diminishing, threats stemming

from rogue states, non-state formations and terrorist groups are becoming more imminent and less

predictable. The likelihood of a terrorist group or a rogue state acquiring and using weapons of mass

destruction is causing especially serious global danger.

Although new unconventional security challenges are replacing traditional threats of armed aggression

against the territory of sovereign states, the use of military force is not declining. Terrorist attacks in

different countries and regions have reached such a level that the only way to prevent them is to use

military force. The nature of conflict itself is changing. Contemporary conflicts are more asymmetrical,

open combat is more intense although shorter in duration, and battlefields are shifting from an open

space into densely populated cities. Conventional military forces of NATO countries are forced to fight

an unpredictable enemy who uses unconventional fighting methods.

Despite some promising trends of political and economic integration, disintegration tendencies that fuel

territorial and ethno-religious conflicts are still widespread. Often, military force is being used to resolve

these conflicts. Ethnic tensions, armed conflicts, or civil wars continue in many regions of the world: Europe

(the Balkans, the Northern Caucasus), Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. Since the mid-1990s, the number

of such conflicts has started to grow. There is a high probability that in the future, due to a growing economic

differentiation between countries, social unrest or resistance to democratisation processes by authoritarian

regimes, civil wars and ethnic clashes may impact entire regions. The international community will have to

respond by launching new peacekeeping and crisis response operations, as well as combat operations

against terrorist networks and against those governments that sponsor terrorism, that seek to acquire and

use the weapons of mass destruction, and that pose a threat to international security.

The present need for security is universal – no state can be completely isolated from the new security

challenges. No state – its size, geopolitical situation, form of government, or religion notwithstanding – is

fully protected from the threats posed by international terrorism or the use of the weapons of mass

destruction. Lithuania, like any other member of the international community, can become a target of

terrorists or a state that sponsors terrorism. Lithuania’s security is closely linked with the stability and

security of distant regions. Conflicts in the Middle East, Central Asia, the Balkans, or the Caucasus may

have an impact on Lithuania. Non-military challenges, like organised crime, illegal trafficking of arms,

drugs and people, and uncontrolled migration stem from these conflict-ridden regions. In certain cases,

using military force to successfully counter these challenges may be necessary.

NATO borders the unstable regions that are impoverished by internal conflicts caused by political,

ethnic, or religious discord and intolerance. Crisis situations in these regions may become unmanageable,

spread, and have negative consequences for the security of NATO member states. Currently, no state or

group of states can pose a direct military threat to the Alliance and thus, Lithuania. Nonetheless, in the

immediate security environment of Lithuania there are certain states that do not exert full democratic

control over disproportionately large military forces, due to a lack of progress towards a democratic

constitutional order. For this reason, a likelihood of provocation, demonstration of force or threat to use

force against Lithuania, albeit insignificant, still exists.

### 2. NEW ROLE AND NEW MISSIONS OF THE ARMED FORCES

The contemporary security environment is very dynamic – the likelihood of some threats is diminishing,

that of others is increasing. For this reason, modern armed forces must be organised in ways that would

enable a flexible and rapid response to rising challenges. In the 21[st] century, the armed forces of

democratic states will have to carry out new missions and meet new operational requirements. Until

recently, the mission of a sovereign state’s armed forces has been to deter a potential enemy from

possible use of military force and defend its territory in case of attack. Deterrence remains an important

role of today’s armed forces, however the nature of this deterrence is changing because the enemy is

different: the main source of threat is no longer the armies of other states but non-state groups and

terrorist networks, often supported by authoritarian regimes and employing unconventional fighting

methods. Such methods are no longer directed against the territories of states, not even against military

objects, but against vulnerable civilian objects (embassies, airports, bus and train terminals), strategic

economic infrastructure (oil extraction terminals), or directly against the civilian population (places of

mass gatherings, stadiums etc.).

The changing nature of threats poses a dual challenge for the LAF, which are now a part of NATO forces.

The internal role of the armed forces within a country is changing. Apart from the traditional mission to

protect its territory from external aggression, the armed forces now must pay more attention to the tasks

that used to be of somewhat secondary importance: to aid civilian institutions in case of a terrorist attack

in Lithuania, to assist in responding to natural disasters, and to protect objects of national importance

such as Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant. When it is necessary to ensure the welfare of society, the military

must be ready to react to the kinds of non-military threats that surpass the capabilities of civilian agencies

to take necessary measures.

Contemporary global threats thrive in the regions of political instability and conflicts, therefore much

higher requirements are set for soldiers - to participate in multinational operations of various types and

intensities far away from home. Well prepared expeditionary forces are needed in order to manage

such complex operations. These forces must be able to deploy and successfully accomplish the mission

even in the most hostile and extreme environment. In the case of a grave threat to the security of NATO,

Lithuania, along with its allies, may need to initiate preventive actions against certain states or groups

within such states.

Mass conscript armies served their purpose for NATO countries when preparing for long conventional

wars and for a slowly moving front line. Modern threats may arise anywhere and anytime, therefore they

can only be eliminated by well-equipped, mobile, professional, rapid response forces. These forces

must train not only to manage an ongoing crisis but also be able to project preventive actions, including

intense combat. To prepare such a force, larger financial investments are needed. By seeking to reform

their armed forces, many NATO countries have to reduce or abandon their unnecessary territorial units,

reorganise reserve forces that were designed to fight a total war into effective, specialised and modern

reserve units, temporarily suspend or eliminate universal conscription duty, and dispose unused

infrastructure and outdated military equipment.

Today, a modern army of a NATO and EU member state has to be prepared not only to “extinguish” fires

within a country but also be able to perform threat prevention in any place around the world. Threats to

Lithuania’s national security arise far beyond the country’s borders; hence, training of the armed forces

must primarily focus not on territorial defence but on the ability to respond to crises anywhere in the

world. Lithuanian soldiers have to travel to hot spots before the consequences of conflicts reach the

homeland. Participation of Lithuania in international operations is one of the main and most effective

ways to ensure the country’s security.

New missions call for a qualitatively new image of the soldier: today’s soldier not only has to be prepared

militarily, but also must have relevant education, understand international politics and be proficient in

foreign languages, in other words, be an all-around professional. Lithuanian soldiers, serving in international

operations as part of a multinational force, must match fellow allied soldiers in morale, preparedness

and type of equipment used.

An ever-changing international security environment of the 21[st] century and new threats oblige NATO

Allies to re-examine the organisational structures of their armed forces as well as their military strategies

and doctrine. They must also invest more in the procurement of new military technologies. There is

increasing attention to the development of special operations forces and light- and medium-sized military

units. Modern command, control, communications, computers, and intelligence (C4I) systems are necessary

to guarantee effective interaction between multinational forces. In an effort to avoid civilian and military

casualties during conflicts, NATO Allies are procuring the newest military equipment, such as long
distance precision guided weapons, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), etc. Only a fully coordinated

interaction between all these elements can give the allied force an edge in the fight against contemporary

threats. Lithuania’s soldiers will have to be able to adjust to and effectively perform within such a force.

### 3. THE MAIN DIRECTIONS OF LITHUANIA’S DEFENCE POLICY

In developing its defence policy, Lithuania assumes that security is indivisible and the countries of the

Euro-Atlantic community can overcome modern transnational threats only by working closely together.

To help ensure a secure environment for long-term development of society, Lithuania has joined NATO

and the EU in 2004. As a member of these organisations, Lithuania develops and implements its

defence policy by working and consulting with the Allies to resolve the most pressing security problems.

The main objective of Lithuania’s defence policy remains unchanged – to ensure the security of Lithuania’s

vital interests as defined in the National Security Strategy: the sovereignty of the Republic of Lithuania;

its territorial integrity and democratic constitutional order; respect to and protection of human and civil

rights and freedoms; and peace and welfare of the state. Now, however, the security, democratic governance,

and welfare of other NATO and EU members are also among the primary security interests of Lithuania.

By becoming a member of these organisations, Lithuania has assumed a common responsibility to

assure the security of the entire Euro-Atlantic area: Lithuania’s security interests have become the

security interests of NATO and EU, while the interests of these organisations have become the security

interests of Lithuania. Lithuania’s defence policy will continue to be open, transparent, and never directed

against the rightful interests of any state. Being a full-fledged member of the Euro-Atlantic community,

however, Lithuania cannot remain on the sidelines of global processes. Lithuania, while projecting its

defence policy, takes into account the new global security environment, the new threats and the new role

that the armed forces have to undertake.

#### 3.1 Strengthening Euro-Atlantic Security

Taking into consideration the new trends in the security environment and the new missions of the armed

forces, NATO has modified its organisational structure. NATO is in the process of building modern capabilities

and rapid response forces while it has increased the volume and expanded the geographical boundaries of

its international operations. The EU is also seeking to contribute to transatlantic security by strengthening its

security and defence policy and creating new military capabilities. Until recently, Lithuania has been situated

at the periphery of the Euro-Atlantic security area, but now, with the accession to both NATO and the EU,

Lithuania has become an integral part of this area. Lithuania has acquired a completely new foundation –

collective defence guarantees – to develop its defence policy. Hence, Lithuania has actively been engaged

in the processes of NATO transformation and the development of EU security and defence policy.

**A Strong Alliance. Lithuanian membership in NATO is based on several key principles that contribute to**

strengthening the security of the whole Alliance:

###### � Active Membership. Lithuania seeks to be an active member of the Alliance by meaningfully

contributing to the political and military activities of the Alliance, assuming and properly implementing

commitments to the Alliance, participating in NATO international operations.

###### � Collective Decisions. A spirit of collectiveness and political unity of the Alliance is the foundation

of security of the whole Euro-Atlantic community. Lithuania will always support collective decisions

and actions of the Alliance as the best response to security challenges faced by NATO countries in

an insecure strategic environment. Considering the unpredictable nature of contemporary threats,

Lithuania will seek to make both the NATO and national decision-making and implementation

processes more flexible, enabling fast and timely decisions.

###### � Effective Defence Planning. Lithuania will strive to optimise the effectiveness of the Alliance’s

defence planning process. The most important condition for success of the Alliance is implementation

of the commitments assumed by its members. Aiming for effective work of the Alliance, NATO members


-----

|11111 77777 W H I T E|P A P E R|
|---|---|


must share the tasks, costs and responsibilities in proportion to their potential. Lithuania will reduce

or even eliminate those capabilities that can only be used for national purposes and do not contribute

to the collective defence of the Alliance. A priority of NATO defence planning is the development of

forces that can be deployed and sustained in NATO operations anywhere in the world. The Alliance

has set the following usability targets for Land Forces: at least 40 percent of the Land Forces of each

Ally should be structured, prepared and equipped for deployed operations, and at least 8 percent

planned for or undertaking sustained operations at any time.

###### � Collective Capabilities. Lithuania will seek to strengthen the Alliance’s collective defence and

readiness to respond to new security challenges. The Alliance must expand collective capabilities

such as NATO’s air defence system, ground surveillance system, early warning and air control

system, and the NATO Response Force (NRF). With these capabilities, the Allies will be able to react

rapidly to crises and ensure the Alliance’s common interests. Lithuania actively seeks to participate

in Alliance-wide projects and assigns its units to the NRF. Lithuania also contributes to the

implementation of the 2002 Prague capabilities commitments, aiming to strengthen capabilities that

the Alliance lacks.

**Strong Europe in the Alliance. The EU must assume a greater responsibility for strengthening European**

security. Lithuania actively contributes to the development of the European Security and Defence Policy as a

way to build up readiness of the Euro-Atlantic community to deter contemporary threats. A strong transatlantic

link between the US and Europe is an essential precondition to the long-term security of Lithuania, therefore

Lithuania promotes the formation of multinational NATO and EU forces according the following principles:

###### � A single force for two organisations – Lithuania supports the principle of non-duplication of NATO

and EU assets and procedures by assigning and using the same units to fulfil commitments to both

organisations.

###### � Coordination of force planning and operational planning – Lithuania does not consider it necessary

for the EU to develop structures and capabilities that NATO already possesses, and perform functions

(such as collective defence), which are successfully undertaken by NATO. The EU and NATO must take

into account each other’s planning processes. Member states should not face a dilemma of which

organisation’s mission to participate in or how to allocate forces between the two organisations.

###### � Decision-making coordination – In seeking to effectively fight various threats, NATO and the EU

countries must closely coordinate decision-making on issues of vital importance to the Euro-Atlantic

community.

Lithuania seeks to participate actively in the decision-making and implementation processes of the European

security and defence policy; therefore Lithuania fully supports the European Defence Agency, which aims at

strengthening military capabilities of the EU member states. Lithuania also actively contributes to the development

of the EU battle group, consisting of Polish, German, Slovakian, Lithuanian and Latvian troops.

#### 3.2 Projection of Stability

Lithuania and its armed forces directly contribute to the efforts of the Euro-Atlantic community to expand

the sphere of stability through participation in international operations, arms control regimes, security

and confidence building measures, support for the Alliance’s open door policy to aspiring candidate

countries, and active contribution to the Alliance’s defence cooperation with NATO partners, such as

Ukraine, Georgia, Moldova and other countries in the South Caucasus, the Central Asia, and the Balkans.

**International Operations. Lithuania’s defence policy is based on the assumption that a threat to the**

Alliance or to any of its members constitutes a threat to Lithuania. Seeking to prevent crises where they

are likely to arise, Lithuania will continue to be actively engaged in international operations and, when

needed, together with the Allies, take preventive actions against the potential sources of danger. Lithuania

supports NATO aspirations to take greater responsibility for international security and, in the future, even

more actively engage in peacekeeping, peacemaking, and when necessary – participating in combat

missions anywhere in the world.

During the last ten years, more than two thousand Lithuanian soldiers have participated in ten international

operations and two missions of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).

Lithuania is increasing its input to international operations annually. In 2005, the number of Lithuanian

soldiers constantly sustained abroad reached an average of 230. Also in 2005, Lithuania assumed

leadership of a Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT) in Afghanistan as a part of NATO’s International

Security Assistance Force (ISAF). Lithuanian soldiers assist the central government of Afghanistan to

extend its reach into the Ghor province, perform security sector reform, and maintain dialogue between

the central government, international organisations, and local leaders. Lithuania will also continue

participating in the coalition-led operation and NATO-led training mission in Iraq. From the end of 2004,

Lithuania has commenced participation in the EU-led operation “Althea” in Bosnia and Herzegovina,

and continued participation in the NATO-led peacekeeping mission in the Kosovo province (KFOR). In

2005, Lithuania has also assisted Pakistan in the aftermath of a disastrous earthquake and deployed its

troops as part of the NRF.

Active participation in operations enables Lithuania to assert its position in international organisations

and have more influence in setting their agendas. In addition, real-time operation experience is essential

to ensure adequate preparation of Lithuanian troops to act together with allied forces and defend the

common values and security interests of Lithuania and the Alliance.

In the future, in order to carry out its NATO commitments Lithuania will have to increase its contributions

to international operations. Lithuania is gradually implementing the established objective of enhancing

the efficiency of its participation in international operations. Lithuania aims at deploying larger, self
sustaining units, while reducing the number of missions. By establishing clear priorities, Lithuania will

be able to offer a greater and more meaningful contribution to separate operations, gain more experience

of deploying larger units, and utilise ever-limited funds more efficiently.

Any decision to send Lithuanian troops to participate in international operations depends on several

criteria:

###### � Consistency of the goals of the international operation with the state’s security and foreign policy

interests;

###### � Importance of the region where the operation is taking place to Lithuania as a member of NATO and

the EU;

###### � Leading organisation of the operation – a priority is given to NATO and EU-led operations, while

the positions of strategic partners and Allies is taken into account;

###### � Ability to provide required military capabilities and availability of financial resources;

 � International mandate to execute the operation;

 � Political (state’s international status, relations with partner states) and military (increased military

experience, professionalism, interoperability with the Allies) benefits of participation in the operation.

**Security Objectives in Other Regions. Lithuania seeks to ensure that the Euro-Atlantic integration process**

continues. The vision of a whole and free Europe is not yet complete: there are countries in Europe where

democratic values, stability, and welfare are not yet well established. For these reasons, Lithuania actively

contributes to the promotion of Euro-Atlantic values and the projection of security and the sphere of stability

to other regions. Lithuania’s defence policy towards its Eastern neighbors assumes that the transatlantic

security framework will only be complete by involving Ukraine, Moldova, and countries of South Caucasus

and Central Asia into the activities of Euro-Atlantic institutions, and strengthening constructive dialogue

with Russia. This direction of Lithuania’s defence policy is based on two core principles:

###### � Multilateralism – Lithuania will share its experience of defence cooperation in the Baltic Sea

region with regions that are interested in such cooperation. Within NATO and the EU, Lithuania will

promote a more active engagement with the countries of the South Caucasus, the Central Asia and the

Balkans in order to strengthen transparency, trust and stability in those regions. Lithuania will also

support multilateral efforts to accelerate the resolution of “frozen” conflicts in Moldova, Georgia and

Nagorno Karabach.

###### � Practical Initiatives – Lithuania will contribute to security projection in neighboring regions through

concrete practical initiatives: sharing experiences in regional defence cooperation projects; aiding the

creation of modern armed forces as a constituent part of civil society; and fostering interoperability with

NATO forces in international operations. Lithuania’s support to the countries of the South Caucasus, the

Balkans, Moldova, and other NATO partners includes: training and studies at the Baltic Defence College

and Lithuanian Military Academy; bilateral and multilateral consultations on defence reforms, integration

into NATO and other security issues; and financial and material aid. Lithuania will continue to provide

practical assistance to Afghanistan, Iraq and other countries, in particular by training their security forces.

An important objective of Lithuania’s defence policy is strengthening mutual trust and promoting a good

neighborhood spirit with countries that do not belong to NATO or the EU, and do not seek membership in

those organisations, namely Russia and Belarus. Russia’s participation in confidence and security building

measures and arms control regimes increases the stability in Lithuania’s immediate neighborhood. A

renewed and stronger partnership between NATO and Russia serves the interests of Lithuania. Lithuania

will continue to pursue equal and mutually beneficial military cooperation with Russia through active

participation in the NATO-Russia Council and in common military exercises. In addition, new forms of

cooperation will be sought that would not be limited to political consultations, but would bring tangible

practical results and strengthen mutual trust between the two sides.

Defence cooperation with Belarus has thus far been limited to the implementation of confidence and

security building measures, however, in the future Lithuania will seek a more active military cooperation

with this country. A long-term strategic interest of Lithuania is the consolidation of democracy in Belarus.

Belarus’ international isolation does not encourage democratization and does not build trust between

NATO and Belarus. Lithuania will foster an open dialogue between the military of both countries, organise

common and mutually acceptable military events, and support the implementation of NATO interoperability

requirements in the Belarusian armed forces.

**Arms Control. Implementation of international agreements on arms control, disarmament, and arms**

export/import controls is another important means to promote security and stability. Given the nature of

modern threats, special attention must be directed at  preventing and fighting the proliferation of weapons

of mass destruction. To this end, Lithuania actively participates in:

###### � activities and initiatives of international organisations that seek to eliminate any possibility of illegal

arms trafficking;

###### � initiatives of international organisations that limit the proliferation of small and light arms in developing

countries;

###### � agreements that prohibit the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.

The Adapted Conventional Forces in Europe (A-CFE) Agreement, signed in 1999 by the OSCE, remains

an important pillar of European security and stability. Lithuania will consider acceding to this agreement

after it is ratified.

**Confidence and Security Building Measures. The implementation of confidence and security building**

measures encourages the creation of a secure and stable environment in Europe, helps prevent unexpected

aggression, and avoids the use of military forces as a means of political pressure. As its contribution to

military transparency and confidence building, Lithuania provides the OSCE with data on it’s armed forces,

military equipment, defence budget and scheduled military exercises.

#### 3.3 International Defence Cooperation

After becoming a member of NATO and the EU, Lithuania continues to actively participate in the most

important regional and international cooperation forums, while its activity and attention to particular

projects depend on their importance to Lithuania’s security interests. Lithuania pursues an active multilateral

and bilateral defence cooperation policy by paying particular attention to those multilateral projects that

strengthen security and the readiness of the whole Alliance to respond to new threats and challenges.

#### 3.3.1. Multilateral Defence Cooperation

**Trilateral Cooperation of the Baltic States. Cooperation projects among the three Baltic States have**

been essential in symbolic, political and practical terms on their way to NATO membership. The Baltic

States continue to hold trilateral consultations on different levels and cooperate on the most important

defence issues, however, most of the trilateral projects have been implemented or are in the process of

being integrated into relevant NATO structures. In 2003, the Baltic Infantry Battalion project (BALTBAT)

was terminated. The Baltic countries air surveillance network (BALTNET) is being integrated into NATO’s

integrated air defence system. The Baltic States have agreed to cooperate in ensuring support for the

NATO Air policing mission covering all three countries and acquire the necessary equipment to monitor

and control this regional airspace. The Baltic mine counter measures squadron (BALTRON) is considered

a good base for preparing the Baltic mine counter measures ships to integrate into the Standing NRF

Mine Counter Measures Group (SNMCMG). Academic programs of the Baltic Defence College

(BALTDEFCOL) have been brought up to NATO standards. In the future, Lithuania will continue to

develop this trilateral military cooperation to benefit the whole Alliance and help build military capabilities.

**Northern Europe. Lithuania supports a closer cooperation between Northern European countries (Sweden,**

Finland, Norway, Denmark, and Iceland) and the three Baltic States (NB-8), and encourages its development

and strengthening. Nordic and Baltic countries could pursue common projects designed to improve

military capabilities in defined areas (e. g. in science and technology, peacekeeping, logistics, special

operations forces), and cooperate in projecting the sphere of democracy and stability in the Eastern

Europe and the South Caucasus. In addition, cooperation between Nordic and Baltic countries helps

maintain close defence relations with Sweden and Finland, which are not NATO members.

Lithuania also promotes the development of military cooperation between Nordic and Baltic countries

and the USA. Maintaining continuous attention of the USA in the Baltic region, continuing practical

defence cooperation with the US Government, and promoting a US military presence in the region are

among the priorities of Lithuania’s defence policy. The US-proposed Enhanced Partnership in Northern

Europe (E-PINE) initiative, which, among other things, aims at strengthening cooperative security in the

region, could be a good prospective base for strengthening multilateral security cooperation.

**The Vilnius Process. The Vilnius Group (V-10) activities have been an important factor, which helped**

the Central and Eastern European countries to coordinate their NATO integration efforts. The Vilnius

Process, as a means to bring the candidate countries closer to the Euro-Atlantic community, should

continue and encompass not only Macedonia, Croatia and Albania, but also Ukraine, countries of the

South Caucasus, and, in the long-run, other NATO partners. As the initiator of the Vilnius Process,

Lithuania will continue to be its active supporter.

**The United Nations. Lithuania is planning to further develop relations with the United Nations (UN), and**

as a member of this organisation, will put in more effort to strengthen international security. Lithuania

belongs to the UN Stand-by Forces system and has assigned its units to the Standy-by High Readiness

Brigade (SHIRBRIG).

**Orgnization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council. The**

OSCE and the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council are the largest institutions of transatlantic cooperation,

encompassing 55 and 46 members respectively “from Vancouver to Vladivostok.” Lithuania will seek

that existing opportunities would be exploited fully to strengthen international stability. The activities of

the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council should bring practical benefits to its members not only through

consultations, but also through improving interoperability between the forces of NATO Allies and partners,

offering joint military exercises, and involving partners in Alliance’s operations. The OSCE arms control

regime and confidence and security-building measures also remain important. Lithuania will continue to

prompt the OSCE to apply more effective pressure methods on the countries that disregard or gravely

violate international arms control agreements.

#### 3.3.2. Bilateral Defence Cooperation

Lithuania takes part not only in the activities of international organisations and other multilateral cooperation

forums but also actively pursues its goals in the area of bilateral defence cooperation. Most of this

cooperation takes place with NATO members, neighboring countries, and other states that are strategically

important to Lithuania’s national security. Developing Lithuania’s relations with the USA, Lithuania’s

strategic partner, is one of the main priorities of Lithuania’s defence policy and a condition for ensuring

long-term security. Lithuania also has close defence cooperation ties with Poland, Denmark, and Ukraine.

**The United States of America. Until Lithuania’s accession to NATO, defence and security cooperation**

with the USA was based on a partnership charter signed between the Baltic States and the USA in 1998.

US political support and military aid has greatly facilitated Lithuania’s integration into NATO. Lithuania’s

membership in the Alliance has raised its cooperation with the USA to a higher level. In the wake of the

September 11 terrorist attacks against the USA, Lithuania has joined the international coalition to fight

terrorism. Lithuanian troops participate in coalition and NATO-led operations in Afghanistan and Iraq.

Lithuania supports the efforts of the USA, as leader of the democratic world, to strengthen peace and

stability in the world, fight terrorism and regimes that support terror, and prevent the proliferation of

weapons of mass destruction. The USA on its part continues to provide military aid to Lithuania: every

year, through the Foreign Military Financing (FMF) program, the USA provides Lithuania with funds to

procure modern military equipment and weapons. Through the International Military Education Training

(IMET) program, each year some 60–70 Lithuanian military and civilian personnel study in the USA.

American advisors work at the Ministry of National Defence. The USA also provides substantial support

to Lithuanian troops participating in operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. In the future, Lithuania will seek

to expand and strengthen bilateral military cooperation with the USA in solving important security

problems of mutual interest inside and outside the Baltic Sea region. In order to keep the USA involved

in the Baltic Sea region, Lithuania will organise common military exercises, training, and pursue other

military cooperation projects.

**Poland. Poland has also provided significant support to Lithuania in preparing for NATO membership.**

Lithuanian-Polish bilateral cooperation is manifested by constant consultations, mutual support, and

combined exercises. The most visible practical result of this cooperation has been the establishment of

the Lithuanian-Polish battalion (LITPOLBAT). Lithuanian troops participate in international operations in

Kosovo and Iraq as part of the Polish contingent. Lithuania will continue active military cooperation with

Poland. It has been decided to reorganise the Kosovo-based Lithuanian-Ukrainian battalion (POLUKRBAT)

into a trilateral Lithuanian-Polish-Ukrainian battalion (POLUKRLITBAT), where the Lithuanian contingent

would be expanded from a platoon-size unit to a company-size unit. Together with Germany, Slovakia,

and Latvia, Lithuania will join the Polish-led EU battle group by contributing one infantry company with

support units.

**Denmark is a traditional partner of Lithuania. Denmark has practically and politically supported Lithuania’s**

strategic goals – membership in NATO and the EU – and has been providing substantial material aid. There


-----

|22222 55555 W H I T E|P A P E R|
|---|---|


are a number of ongoing intensive projects, particularly focusing on training and bringing Lithuania’s

armed forces up to NATO standards and requirements. One of the most important long-term projects is

the Lithuanian brigade project (LITBRIG). It aims at developing a combat-ready Motorised Infantry Brigade

(MIB) “Iron Wolf” and enabling it to fully participate in NATO military activities and operations.

In the summer of 2005, Lithuania and Denmark have signed a letter of intent aimed at eventual affiliation

of the MIB “Iron Wolf” with the Danish division. According to this agreement, joint military exercises will

be conducted and Lithuanian officers will be provided an opportunity to work at Division headquarters.

Such cooperation will greatly accelerate the integration of LAF into NATO military structures.

Lithuanian and Danish soldiers also constantly participate in joint exercises. Lithuanian units are a part

of Danish contingents in Iraq and Kosovo, while Denmark contributes troops to the Lithuanian-led PRT

in Afghanistan.

**Ukraine. An ever-growing partnership is developing between Lithuania and Ukraine. Europe’s security**

system would not be complete without involving Ukraine in the activities of European and transatlantic

institutions. For this reason, Lithuania will actively support Ukraine’s Euro-Atlantic integration efforts,

continue bilateral meetings at all levels, consult on integration-related questions, and strengthen cooperation

in military education and training. Lithuania considers Ukraine ready for the Membership Action Plan

and for actual membership in NATO, once it fulfils all the necessary requirements. In the future, Lithuania

will also seek to strengthen the trilateral defence cooperation with Poland and Ukraine.

Intensive bilateral defence cooperation with the UK, Germany, Norway, Sweden, Canada, and Turkey

also significantly helps Lithuania to develop its military capabilities and complete its integration into the

Alliance’s structures.

### 4. DEFENCE REFORM: BUILDING MODERN ARMED FORCES

A changing global security environment, new missions, tasks and requirements for the armed forces are

the main causes of the reform of the LAF. A review of the LAF is a part of the process that encompasses the

entire Alliance. In carrying out the defence reform Lithuania faces a two-fold challenge: while reorganising

and modernising its own armed forces, Lithuania must also constantly monitor and react accordingly to

structural and functional changes taking place within NATO and the EU. The main goal of the reform is to

prepare LAF to effectively respond to the new security threats that the Alliance and Lithuania face. To

accomplish this goal Lithuania needs forces that would be ready to respond rapidly to threats today and

tomorrow. These forces must be adequately trained and equipped. They must be mobile and capable of

acting together with NATO forces to ensure the defence of the Alliance and Lithuania, and to contribute to

a wide spectrum of NATO operations outside the borders of Lithuania. In addition, LAF will have to continue

performing certain important functions inside the country. The armed forces have to be ready to protect

objects of national importance and assist civilian authorities in times of crisis, when civilian institutions lack

or do not have necessary capabilities.

#### 4.1. Shifting from Territorial to Collective Defence Principles

NATO membership brought a major change in the assumptions of Lithuania’s defence planning – collective

defence guarantees. This is the essential difference between Lithuania’s defence policy before and after

becoming a member of NATO. Article 5 of the North Atlantic treaty, stating that “an armed attack against one

or more of them (NATO members) in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them

all,” creates a new situation for Lithuania’s defence and security. Today and in the nearest future no single

state or group of states will be capable to threaten the Alliance militarily.

|---|---|


Considering this new security condition, Lithuania has reviewed anew some of its total and unconditional

defence principles that until recently constituted the core of Lithuania’s deterrence and defence strategy.

This does not mean that Lithuania does not require credible armed forces or that Lithuania is not going to

be prepared to ensure an effective homeland defence, or that resistance against an aggressor will not be

total. Lithuania reviewed those principles of national defence (such as territorial defence, large numbers of

conscript and reserve forces, a mobilization system prepared for total war, and civic preparedness for

guerilla warfare) that are no longer relevant in the present security environment and no longer consistent

with Lithuania’s – as a NATO member – armed forces development plans. In establishing new requirements

for the armed forces, it has been assumed that in case of a large military threat, LAF will not be left alone in

defending the homeland, and will participate in a NATO collective defence operation.

Possessing limited resources, Lithuania cannot at once maintain territorial forces and properly participate

in the Alliance’s operations. This all comes down to faith in the guarantees of collective defence. For 40

years NATO has successfully deterred the Soviet Union from possible aggression against Western Europe.

Thus far, only twice have the Alliance members asked for security consultations in accordance with Article

4 of the Washington treaty, (both consultations were requested by Turkey, due to conflicts in the Persian

Gulf). Article 5 has only been used once – after the September 11 terrorist attacks against the US. Lithuania’s

membership in NATO has raised the effectiveness of deterrence to a level that Lithuania would not be able

to achieve alone, however the membership cannot be and is not the only condition of deterrence. Mobile

and well-prepared LAF will be capable to manage a small-scale crisis on its own, such as border violations

or a military provocation. It is assumed that in case of a large-scale military conflict, NATO forces would be

deployed to Lithuania before the beginning of any aggression.

Collective defence guarantees create conditions for the Alliance members to specialise in building NATO

capabilities. Taking into account the resources, opportunities and experience that the Allies possess in

certain areas, NATO develops the Force Goals – specific capability requirements that every country is

asked to develop and commit for the Alliance. Having joined the NATO force planning process, Lithuania

has begun to develop capabilities that are needed for strengthening of the whole Alliance, while refraining

from developing capabilities that NATO as a whole has in abundance. Sharing risks, responsibilities and

tasks is the essence of the Alliance’s spirit of collectiveness. The NATO air policing mission in the Baltic

States is the best proof of credible collective solidarity. NATO members, on a rotational basis, provide their

jets, pilots, and supporting personnel for the NATO air policing mission in the Baltic States, which do not

possess air policing capabilities. On their part, the Baltic countries are not procuring jets, instead they are

investing their resources in other areas important for NATO. For example, Lithuania trains units that

specialise in water purification, mine counter measure, explosive ordnance disposal, etc.

#### 4.2. New Missions and Requirements for the Lithuanian Armed Forces

**New missions. Changes in Lithuania’s strategic environment and new security threats prompt new**

tasks for LAF. Lithuania’s new military strategy outlines new military missions for LAF:

###### � to ensure a reliable deterrence in cooperation with the Allies; in case deterrence fails, to defend

Lithuania’s sovereignty, territory, territorial waters and airspace in cooperation with the Allies

and counter any military aggression;

###### � to ensure the collective defence commitments assumed by Lithuania;

 � to participate in NATO-, EU-, and UN-led international operations and other, coaltion-led

operations that contribute to the goals of these organisations;

###### � to implement confidence and security building measures and participate in arms control regimes;

 � to ensure homeland and Alliance security by responding to threats of terrorism and the proliferation

of weapons of mass destruction;

###### � to participate in neutralising the activities of foreign intelligence services and ensuring protection

of classified information;

###### � to provide assistance to national and local institutions by responding to threats of a non-military

nature and terrorist attacks.

**New Requirements for the Armed Forces. LAF, including its Active Reserve, are tasked with the**

following requirements that correspond to the requirements set by NATO ministers for Alliance forces:

###### � Efficiency – all units must be well prepared and equipped with modern weaponry and equipment,

capable to act as part of multinational units. All forces must constantly maintain their assigned level

of readiness and be prepared to react rapidly to any threat in Lithuania or outside its borders. By

assessing intelligence data, the forces must be able to utilize sufficient combat power against any

enemy. Accurate intelligence data and targeting on the contemporary battlefield are becoming

necessary conditions for success.

###### � Deployment – all combat units together with combat support and combat service support units

must be prepared for international operations outside the borders of Lithuania and ready to deploy by

land and strategic air- and sea-lift. Lithuania must be capable to deploy its forces whenever or wherever

there is a need, in order – together with the Allies – to manage a crisis and prevent it from escalating.


-----

|33333 11111 W H I T E|P A P E R|
|---|---|


###### � Sustainability – the logistics system must enable the deployed forces to sustain themselves for a

defined period of time and rotate smoothly afterwards. Deployed units must be able to sustain

themselves in conflict zones even without any host nation support. Adequate transportation and

logistics capabilities are vital for troop survival in remote conflict zones.

###### � Multi-role – all combat units must be able to participate in all kinds of operations, and react to all

kinds of threats, crises and disasters in Lithuania and beyond its borders. The forces must be able to

shift rapidly between combat and peacekeeping actions.

###### � Survivability – deployed units must have adequate protection from nuclear, biological, and

chemical weapons. Since the use of such weapons in modern crises is possible, individual protection

equipment is a necessity.

###### � Effective Command and Control – units must be able to ensure a smooth functioning of modern,

interoperable, and mobile command, control, and communications systems. Maximum interoperability

between these systems and  respective NATO systems is a necessary condition for Lithuanian

military units to act with Allied forces in an effective manner.

#### 4.3. Review of the Armed Forces Structure

**Defence Reform Principles. To ensure that LAF are ready to act in the modern security environment,**

meet its high requirements and implement its tasks, a of review of LAF structure is carried out. Structural

overview is a complex and long process, encompassing the reorganisation, merging, or dissolution of

military units, personnel downsizing, and disbandment of unnecassary military infrastructure. This process

is crucial in order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of the national defence system.

In carrying out the defence reform, the emphasis and priorities of defence planning have shifted from

large military units designed for territorial defence to the development of capabilities necessary for the

collective defence of the Alliance and Lithuania. According to this principle, Lithuania has abandoned

plans for building up Land Forces consisting of three infantry brigades prepared for territorial defence. In

2003, after abandoning the doctrine of territorial defence, the Eastern Military District was disbanded,

and in 2004, the Western Military District was disbanded. Two infantry battalions were reorganised into

logistic battalions. Lithuanian The Grand Duke Kæstutis Motorised Infantry Battalion was moved to the

MIB “Iron Wolf.” The First and Second Air Force Bases were merged into one Air Force Base in Ðiauliai.

Upon the completion of these reforms, Lithuania will be able to field armed forces that will be able to

react more rapidly, be more mobile, easier to deploy, better equipped, and better trained to be able to

contribute to any kind of NATO-led or other operation inside or outside the country.

**National Level of Ambitions. The MIB “Iron Wolf” will consitute the main combat power of the Lithuanian**

Armed Forces. It will be well-trained and fully equipped with modern technology and weaponry and fully

interoperable with NATO forces. Battalions of the MIB will be ready to participate in the full-spectrum of


-----

|W H I T E|P A P E R 33333 22222|
|---|---|


NATO operations. On rotation basis, the MIB will generate one battalion-size task group with all its

combat support and combat service support elements, ready to be deployed and sustained wherever

Alliance and Lithuanian security interests will be at stake. In addition to their specific missions and tasks,

other services of the armed forces will be prepared to provide all-around support for the deployable

battalion task group, including combat support and combat service support. Logistical battalions and

other relevant units will ensure smooth deployment of the task group and its sustainability, and will

contribute to NATO higher level formations, (e.g. movement control and deployment support teams,

water purification unit).

Note: Bn. – Battalion

structure of the armed forces in 2011.


-----

|33333 33333 W H I T E|P A P E R|
|---|---|


The National Defence Volunteers (NDV) will augment the regular units and be ready to provide specialists

to perform specific tasks in international operations. Units of the Special Operations Forces (SOF) will be

able to act autonomously and perform separate missions. The Air Force will provide support to international

operations and will ensure tactical air transportation forLAF units. The Navy will contribute to NATO’s

mine counter measure activities. Lithuania, through the NATO force planning process, has also assumed

a commitment to the Alliance to provide other specialised units (see table 4.4.). This future vision

underpins the reforms that have been already taking place in most of the Armed Forces units.

Upon completion of the current defence reform, Lithuania will project to have at least 50 percent of its

Land Forces[2] structured, prepared and equipped for deployed operations and at least 10 percent planned

for or undertaking sustained operations at any given time.

� A formal formation of the Guard of Honour Company of the Lithuanian Armed Forces

2 According to the NATO definition, the land forces consist of the units that are capable of carrying out combat, combat support and combat
service support tasks on the land and other related tasks. The following units of the LAF correspond this definition: Land Forces (MIB “Iron Wolf”,
Engineer Battalion, and National Defence Volunteers), Special operations forces, Forward Logistics Support Battalion, Main Logistics Support
Battalion, Medical Service, Military Police, Training and Doctrine Command and Headquarters Battalion.

3 The units assigned to NRF are rotated every 6 month: the units have to undergo a 6 month training, followed by 6 months on stand-by and 6
months for rehabilitation. Each rotation cycle is attributed an appropriate number of sequence.

|33333 55555 W H I T E|P A P E R|
|---|---|


**Improving Management of the National Defence System. In the process of transforming LAF from**

territorial defence forces into modern deployable forces, corresponding changes are necessary in the

national defence command and control system. The goal of management reform is to create a modern and

effective management system that would match the new force structure and ensure an effective decision
making process when dealing with new security threats. In attempting to prevent a terrorist act, some

military provocation or a natural disaster, it is essential to be able to make fast and competent decisions.

The main task of the reforms is to clearly define and distinguish between the strategic, operational and

tactical levels of command. Such separation would allow for a better allocation of resources and a better

distribution of functions and responsibilities. In addition, there will be less duplication of functions and the

decision making process will be smoother and faster.

On the strategic level, the Ministry of National Defence will be responsible for: the formation of security and

defence policy; preparation of strategic plans, programs and budget; management of resources; personnel

policy; and implementation of procurement policy.

On the operational level, a Joint Staff will be responsible for operational planning and execution, and for

implementation of tasks set in the strategic plans.

On the tactical level, armed forces units will be responsible for maintaining combat readiness and generating

capabilities for operations. The supply and administration of units will also be carried out at this level.

A reformed management of the National Defence System will guarantee the implementation of tasks that

are envisioned in strategic and planning documents and the fulfilment of international commitments. The

reform of the National Defence Management System is projected to be completed by 2007–2008.

**Ministry of National Defence**

The Ministry of National Defence is responsible for the implementation of defence policy; for the readiness

of the armed forces and other national defence institutions for the collective defence of Homeland and

the Alliance, and for preparations to carry out international commitments.

The Ministry of National Defence plans and executes international defence cooperation with other

states, organises cooperation between the armed forces and civilian institutions and public organisations,

manages the defence budget, procures and maintains equipment for the armed forces, and plans

mobilisation.

**Land Forces**

Land Forces make up the core of Lithuania’s defence force, therefore, in reforming LAF, most of the

attention and financial resources are directed to the development of the Land Forces. Land Forces

consist of the MIB “Iron Wolf,” the Engineer Battalion, and the National Defence Volunteers. Lithuania is

determined to restructure the armed forces so that from the end of 2014, one tenth of the Land Forces

could at any given time be deployed for international operations, while half of the Land Forces would be

prepared to be deployed outside Lithuania’s borders.

The deployment and sustainability capacity of the Land Forces is still hampered by partially outdated

weaponry and limited combat support and combat service support capabilities. Hence, in the beginning

of 2005, the Land Forces were not sufficiently ready to participate in the full spectrum of international

operations. Seeking to overcome these shortfalls and bring the forces up to NATO standards, current

efforts are focused on equipment and armaments modernisation, enhancement of operational effectiveness

and combat training. In the future, the Land Forces will have to participate in ever more diverse and more

complex international operations, therefore the number of professionals in the Land Forces will continue

to grow in order to ensure force mobility and its adaptation to a changing environment.

**MIB “Iron Wolf”**

The MIB “Iron Wolf” consists of: 2 Mechanized Battalions (Lithuanian Grand Duke Algirdas Battalion in Rukla

and King Mindaugas Battalion in Panevezys): 2 Motorised Infantry Battalions (Grand Duchess Birutë Battalion

in Alytus and Lithuanian Grand Duke Kæstutis Battalion in Tauragë); the General Romualdas Giedraitis

Artillery Battalion in Rukla, Headquarters and support units: Headquarters, Reconnaissance and Signal

companies.

In the future, MIB “Iron Wolf” will also have Air Defence and Anti-tank companies, which will ensure the

brigade’s sustainability during operations.

One of the main priorities of the defence reform is the complete preparation of the MIB “Iron Wolf” for collective

defence and international operations. Since the end of 2005, the first battalion task group based on the

Algirdas Battalion is ready to participate in any kind of NATO operation outside Lithuania. A second battalion

task group must be prepared for such operations before the end of 2009. By the end of 2014, MIB “Iron Wolf”

will have to achieve a full operational capability and ensure a full rotation cycle of one battalion-size task

group for international operations.

In striving to achieve these goals, special attention is being paid to the armament of the brigade. In accordance

with available financial means, the weaponry and equipment that are outdated, unreasonably expensive to

maintain, or do not match NATO standards, are being replaced or modernised. To this aim, the new medium
range anti-tank defence system “Javelin” has been already acquired and an agreement has been signed to

acquire the new short-range air defence missile system “Stinger”. New rifles, signal equipment, and protection

equipment from nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons are also in the process of procurement.

MIB “Iron Wolf” uses US-made M-113 armoured-tracked vehicles. In the future, a shift to wheeled vehicles

will be considered. MIB “Iron Wolf” has started using HMMWVs, which are exceptionally durable under

various exploitation conditions. Once MIB “Iron Wolf” is modernised, its battalions will be ready to participate

in the full spectrum of operations – from peacekeeping to combat operations.

The Juozas Vitkus Engineer Battalion will contribute to Lithuania’s international commitments by assigning

Platoon will be ready to participate in international operations autonomously. In the future, there will a

**National Defence Volunteers**

The NDV are a constituent part of the Land Forces. In the beginning of 2006, the NDV consisted of 7 units,

the Lithuanian Grand Duke Butigeidis Dragoon Training Battalion and two Aviation Squadrons.

Until membership in NATO, the main function of the NDV was territorial defence. In accordance with new

requirements, the current units will be reorganised into 5 units organised on a territorial-functional basis.

National Defence Volunteers will be responsible for the administration, management and training of active

reservists.

When this reform is complete, the NDV units will consist of active reservists (volunteers), professionals and

civil servants. The NDV units will have to meet the same requirements as the rest of the armed forces: to be

interoperable with the Allies in combat and crisis response operations of varying scope, type and intensity

inside and outside the borders of Lithuania; and to carry out other assigned tasks inside the country. This

reform will ultimately enable the creation of the armed force based on a single model: any soldier will now

first be a soldier, regardless whether he serves in the regular force or the active reserve.

The NDV will have to carry out the following tasks: augment the regular units that will be deployed in

operations; augment regular units when they shift to a higher level of readiness; train and send individual

specialists to operations of various types; train and send up to company-size infantry units to operations;

assist civilian authorities; and assist in providing host nation support for Allied forces.

After the reform, the active reserve will be organised on a voluntary basis and consist of active reservists

serving in the NDV. The service members, who have completed their conscription duty or received other

military training and satisfied necessary requirements, become eligible to serve in the active reserve.

Others will have to go through the primary training course of a soldier and combat training in the NDV units.

Only those who will complete the primary mandatory training and meet all requirements will become

eligible to be deployed for international operations.

Combat training of active reservists will be reorganised. This program will consist of training and exercises

in both the NDV and regular units, and courses given by the Lithuanian Grand Duke Butigeidis Dragoon

Training Battalion, the Combat Training Centre and other military education institutions. Collective training

will take place in the NDV units, however those active reserve units that will augment the regular force will

also train with appropriate regular force units.

Although the reform is not yet completed and the NDV lack some necessary capabilities to carry out all

assigned tasks, the volunteers have already successfully participated in international operations in the

Balkans, Afghanistan and Iraq.

**Special Operations Forces**

The SOF have been established in 2004, when special operations capabilities came under the command

of a single headquarters. The nucleus of the SOF consists of the Counter Terrorist Unit (CTU) and

Vytautas the Great Jaeger Battalion, while the Naval Special Warfare Unit and the Air Force Special

Operations Group are under the command of the SOF at the operational level. The structure of the SOF

is flexible, enabling formation of mission-tailored squadrons.

One of the main missions of the SOF is counter-terrorist operations beyond the territory of Lithuania. The

SOF also carries out other special missions: direct action, special reconnaissance, rescue of hostages,

and protection of VIPs. The SOF can be called upon inside the territory of Lithuania when law enforcement

agencies lack or do not have necessary capabilities to react to terrorist attacks.

Since Fall 2005, conscripts do not serve in the SOF. The force is formed exclusively of carefully selected,

motivated and specially trained professionals.

SOF squadrons served in the US-led Operation “Enduring Freedom” in Afghanistan from 2002-2004.

Excellent preparedness and execution of tasks by the SOF squadrons have been especially noted by

the coalition partners. NATO has also accepted Lithuania’s offer to include SOF squadrons in NRF-5 and

NRF-6 rotation cycles.

**Air Force**

Lithuania will continue to develop its Air Force, which will be responsible for airspace control and surveillance,

air defence of important national objects, air transportation of personnel and cargo, search and rescue

tasks, support for special operations and host nation support to Allied forces. The Air Force consists of the

Headquarters, the Air Base, the Armaments and Equipment Maintenance Depot, an Airspace Surveillance

and Control Command, an Air Defence Battalion, and a Training Centre.

When Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia became NATO members, their airspace became NATO airspace.

Given that the Baltic States do not possess fighter jets necessary for safeguarding their airspace, NATO

Allies contribute fighter jets on a rotational basis to carry out NATO’s air policing operation over the Baltic

airspace. Sharing tasks and responsibilities with the Allies, the Lithuanian Air Force provides host nation

support to the NATO force conducting this Air Policing mission. NATO jet fighters assigned to the Air

Policing mission are deployed to the Air Base at Ðiauliai. Under the Host Nation Support Program, radar

for precision approximation and a TACAN – Tactical Navigation System – have been positioned at the Air

Base, and mobile hangars, equipment for the maintenance of the take-off and landing strips, and other

equipment were purchased. The Baltic States have committed themselves to fully take over all host nation

support tasks for NATO forces carrying out the Air Policing mission by the end of 2006 (excluding technical

maintenance of the fighter jets).

The BALTNET is connected to the NATO Integrated Air Defence System (NATINADS). Currently the main

unit of the Baltic Airspace Surveillance System is the Regional Airspace Surveillance Coordination Centre

(RASCC), based in Karmëlava. This unit gathers radiolocation information from the radar systems of all

three Baltic States, creating a common air image of the Baltic States and exchanging this picture with other

NATO centres. It provides a constant surveillance of Lithuanian airspace and its immediate neighbourhood,

ensuring a smooth execution of the Air Policing mission. The Baltic States have jointly procured the

equipment necessary for the control of air missions so that it would be possible to control the fighter jets

safeguarding the Baltic airspace from the RASCC. This equipment is of crucial importance to ensure

adequate host nation support to the Allied forces. The Baltic States have committed themselves to take

over the control function of the fighter jets by the end of 2006. The current trilateral RASCC has been

reorganised into a NATO Command and Reporting Centre (CRC).

For successful control of fighter jets, both modern equipment and personnel qualified in accordance to

NATO standards are needed. With the assistance of NATO specialists, Lithuania has started preparing

fighter control operators.

Another priority area for the Air Force is tactical air transportation. The tactical air transport fleet will be

renewed with the aim of strengthening capabilities that ensure adequate execution of air transportation

tasks, including logistical support to units deployed in operations. Air Force aircraft will be able to transport

|W H I T E|P A P E R 44444 22222|
|---|---|


military personnel, conduct medical evacuation, and deliver supplies to a battalion-size task group

deployed in an operation.

Lithuania’s Air Force has experience in international operations. An-26 aircraft with crew have been

deployed to Napoli (Italy) for two years in support of the NATO Stabilisation Force operation (SFOR) in

Bosnia and Herzegovina and the KFOR operation in Kosovo.

Lithuania’s Air Force also has extensive experience in search and rescue tasks both on land and at sea.

In order to strengthen search and rescue capabilities, the helicopter fleet will undergo modernisation in

the near future.

Lithuania is also strengthening its Air Defence Battalion. The main tasks of this battalion are protecting

the airspace above important national objects, (in particular the Ignalina Nuclear power plant), and

defending the country from possible air attacks. In 2004, the Air Defence Battalion has been equipped

with the short range missile system RBS-70 (donated by Norway) and the radar system “Giraffe”. Having

acquired the RBS-70 system, the Air Defence Battalion now has both artillery and missile systems. In the

future, RBS-70 systems will be modernised.

**Navy**

Lithuania seeks to develop and maintain a well prepared, NATO interoperable Navy that will ensure the

protection of national interests in Lithuania’s territorial waters and exclusive economic zone, conduct

mine search and mine counter measure (MCM) operations, search and rescue tasks, and special

operations.

The Navy consists of the Headquarters and Headquarters Company, the Flotilla, a Sea and Coastal

Surveillance Service, Logistics Service, a Training Centre, and Naval Special Warfare Unit. The Flotilla

of Warships is the basis of the Navy’s capabilities. The Flotilla consists of a Division of Warships, a

Division of Mine Counter Measure Ships, a Division of Patrol Ships, and a Division of Cutters.

Having become a member of NATO, Lithuania specialises in the area of MCM and develops appropriate

capabilities that will be a part of NATO’s MCM force. The Baltic MCM Squadron is a good basis for the

integration of Lithuanian Navy’s MCM ships into the SNMCMG. However, due to a lack of modern ships,

the Navy cannot yet sustain MCM capabilities during prolonged operations. The Navy plans to modernize

the “Lindau” class MCM ships and MCM equipment from 2006–2009. By the end of 2007, one MCM ship

will be assigned to the SNMCMG on a rotational basis.

From 2008, 2 “Grisha III” class frigates of the Division of Warships will be disbanded from the Navy.

According to plans, the functions of protecting ports and coastline and patrolling territorial waters and

the exclusive economic zone, which are currently carried out by the frigates, will be taken over by the

patrol ships. The patrol ships will be modernized. In the future there are plans to reinforce the Division of

Patrol Ships by acquiring multifunctional ships to carry out national tasks, particularly patrol and search

and rescue operations.

In times of crisis, the Navy will be ready to provide host nation support to Allied forces. Klaipeda seaport

has to ensure smooth debarkation of incoming Allied forces. In the future, in order to ensure constant

surveillance and control of Lithuania’s territorial waters and exclusive economic zone, the equipment of

the Sea and Coast Surveillance Service will be modernized and the infrastructure of Coastal Surveillance

Posts will be improved.

**Logistics Command**

Before membership in NATO, Lithuania’s military logistics system was being developed to serve the

purposes of territorial defence, limited supply operations, and transportation functions. For full-fledged

participation, sustainment and rotation of LAF units in NATO operations, mobile and rapid reaction

logistics capabilities of a high technical level are necessary.

Creating an effective and single armed forces logistics system is one of the top priorities of defence

reform. In developing the logistics system, particular importance is attached to those capabilities that

enable uninterruptible actions of armed forces units conducting national and international operations.

The core of the logistics system consists of the Logistics Command, the Main Logistics Support Battalion,

and the Forward Logistics Support Battalion. The Main Logistics Support Battalion is responsible for

general support to LAF during peacetime, crisis or war and provides appropriate host nation support to

Allied forces in Lithuania. The Forward Logistics Support Battalion supports the MIB “Iron Wolf”. The

Logistics Command also commands the following units and organisations: the Department of Material

Resources, the Movement Control Centre, the Medical Service, the Depot Service, the Military Cartography

Centre, the Maintenance Service of Rukla Garrison, and the Arsenal.

Units of the Logistics Command and individual military medics have been successfully participating in

international operations in the Balkans, Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. Nonetheless, in trying to meet

new requirements and missions related to international operations, the Logistics Command still lacks

experience and qualified personnel. For this reason, training and development programs for logistics

specialists will have to be improved. In addition, tactical logistics equipment will have to be acquired in

order to develop the capabilities of the Logistics Command.

The Logistics Command will have to prepare specialised units for NATO operations and, when necessary,

will also have to arrange strategic transportation of armed forces units to the area of operations (by

purchasing services from civilian companies or by contracting the armed forces of other countries).

**Training and Doctrine Command**

The Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) is responsible for individual combat training of service

personnel in the institutions of military education of the LAF.

TRADOC commands the Grand Lithuanian Hetman Jonuðas Radvila Training Regiment, The LAF Division

General Stasys Raðtikis School for Non-commissioned Officers (NCO), the LAF General Adolfas

Ramanauskas Combat Training Centre, the Lithuanian Armed Forces Central Polygon, the Reconnaissance

School, and the School of Military Engineering.

In accordance with set goals, TRADOC prepares combat training doctrines, programs and methodical

materials; organises courses for non-commissioned officers and officers in the institutions of military

education, polygons and training centres; and organises the military education of the students form

higher education schools in the Commanders’ training courses.

Upon completion of defence reform, TRADOC will prepare individual training plans for personnel of the

National Defence System, control their implementation, and coordinate the preparation of training programs

of service personnel by the training institutions of the National Defence System. The Lithuanian Military

Academy, Training Regiment (consisting of two Training Battalions), the NCO School and other specialised

institutions of military education will act in accordance with priorities and guidelines set forth by TRADOC.

**Headquarters Battalion**

The Lithuanian Grand Duke Gediminas Headquarters Battalion is under the direct command of the

Commander of the Armed Forces. The Battalion ensures all the support necessary for the Commander

to carry out his duties, organises logistical support of the staff of the Armed Forces, ensures communications

and protection, and performs representational tasks of the LAF. The Battalion consists of the Guard of

Honour Orchestra, the Guard of Honour Company, the Headquarters Company, Logistics Company,

Signals Centre, and the Operational Command Group.

The Guard of Honour Orchestra and the Guard of Honour Company represents the LAF during visits of

high ranking foreign officials in Lithuania.

From 2010, LAF will start establishing a new unit – the Signals Battalion. This battalion will be established

on the basis of the current Signals Centre of the Headquarters Battalion. In the future, the Signals

Battalion will provide command, control and communications support at the strategic and operational

level to the Ministry of National Defence, Joint Staff and other units of the National Defence System.

**Military Police**

The main tasks of the Military Police (MP) are: the prevention of crime and other violations of law, their

detection and investigation; the search for service members, who are under investigation or criminal

prosecution, who have deserted or are missing; detention and convoying of arrested personnel.

The MP are also responsible for public order, assisting commanders in ensuring discipline of service

personnel in military territories and enforcing military transport traffic safety.

The MP will carry out tasks both inside and outside Lithuania. It is planned to assign an MP platoon to

each battalion-size task group deployed in international operations.

#### 4.4 Personnel Management and Training

In building modern armed forces, much attention is being paid to personnel selection and proper training.

For this reason, a legal basis that regulates personnel management has been improved and a new military

specialties code system will be implemented. This code system will create an opportunity to determine

demands for certain military specialties, evaluate military preparation levels, select personnel for studies in

an optimal manner, and plan careers for service members with the intent of giving equal opportunities to all.

After the defence system reform will be implemented, a centralized personnel management and training

system will be created to ensure more effective administration of military and civilian personnel.


-----

|W H I T E|P A P E R 55555 00000|
|---|---|


The personnel of the National Defence System will continue to consist of professional service members,

conscripts, active reservists and civilians. The Active reserve will be reduced to 6500 service members;

the number of conscripts will be reduced to 2000, while the number of professionals will see a moderate

increase to 8420. By 2011, some 19850 military and civilian personnel, including the active reserve, will

serve in the LAF. In order to ensure appropriate readiness of the military units, gradual downsizing of the

conscript number will be accompanied by a gradual increase in the number of professionals.

The main priority in developing the military training system is the implementation of modern training

programs that match the quality and level of corresponding programs of other NATO Allies. The main

goal of training is the proper qualitative preparation of each soldier to meet the complex tasks and

requirements set for the LAF. Considerable attention is given to international military exercises and

training, the teaching of official NATO languages, and improving officer qualifications. To make sure that

the LAF match high readiness standards, all combat training is based on NATO doctrine, while the

programs are prepared in cooperation with other NATO countries.

LAF are trained under the following combat training programs:

###### � soldier’s basic training;

 � individual and specialist training;

 � sergeant and NCO training;

 � officer training;

 � collective training.

� Soldiers perfecting firing skills

|55555 11111 W H I T E|P A P E R|
|---|---|


LAF units undergo collective training during field exercises, headquarters exercises, live-fire exercises,

and in simulation centres.

At the Grand Lithuanian Hetman Jonuðas Radvila Training Regiment, conscripts must undergo an 11
week soldier’s basic training course. During this course, they study national defence statutes, topography,

first-aid basics, NBC protection, signals and tactics, and learn how to use weapons. In the future, all the

active reservists will have to go through basic training at the Training Regiment. Professional soldiers

also attend courses organised by the Training Regiment for physical training instructors and M-113

drivers. This centre also organises 10-week courses for graduates of higher education schools. The

Training Regiment Airborne Training Centre organises airborne training for professional soldiers. Specialised

military training institutions, such as the School of Military Engineering, the Lithuanian Grand Duke

Butigeidis Dragoon Training Battalion, and the Reconnaissance School, offer training in a variety of

military specialties. The NCO School trains leaders from the corps of sergeants and NCOs, specialist
leaders, and specialists of rare professions.

The General Jonas Zemaitis Lithuanian Military Academy is the main academic institution for officers.

The Academy trains officers according to 4-year bachelor’s studies programs. The academy also hosts

6-month Captains’ Courses, 18-month Personnel Management master’s degree program, and a 24
month part-time studies program. International programs are also prominent at the academy. International

Captains’ courses, English, Russian language courses, seminars and conferences are offered by the

Academy for officers from the South Caucasus, Ukraine, and other countries.

General Adolfas Ramanauskas Combat Training Centre organises headquarters exercises, training for

international missions, gun fire commanders, and environment protection courses.

Lithuania, together with the other Baltic States, trains future battalion commanders, commanders of

armed forces services and higher-level staff officers at the Baltic Defence College.

#### 4.5 Defence Resources

Possessing limited resources, Lithuania strives to achieve a balance between planned defence capabilities

and available human, financial and material assets. Defence is planned by taking into account rationally

calculated capacities of the state.

In accordance with the NATO definition of defence expenditure, defence expenditure consists of funds

allocated to the Ministry of National Defence and funds allocated to administer conscription and mobilisation

at the local government level. In 2006, overall Lithuanian defence expenditures stands at 961.1 million litai

(lt), or 1.28 percent of GDP (the projected GDP for 2006 is 75,218 million lt); allocations directly for the

Ministry of National Defence amount to 956.5 million lt, or 1.27 percent of GDP.

The budget of the Ministry of National Defence, (i.e. expenditure directly related to the preparation of the

LAF for collective defence tasks) will have to increase for Lithuania to successfully continue its defence


-----

|W H I T E|P A P E R 55555 22222|
|---|---|


reforms and build up of modern capabilities. The modernisation and professionalisation of the LAF and

implementation of international commitments, in particular meeting NATO force goals and participating in

international operations, will depend directly upon the growth of the defence budget.

In 2006, as much as 82.2 percent of the budget of the Ministry of National Defence is allocated to six

programs (Land Forces, SOF, Air Force, Navy, Logistics and Military training), which have a direct effect on

the build up of defence capabilities. The rest of the budget is devoted to programs that enable the implementation

of material and informational support for the National Defence System, its smooth functioning, and assistance

to the civilian authorities in preparing for crisis prevention and crisis management.

**Personnel. The welfare of service personnel and their families is a key factor in seeking to attract and**

maintain qualified personnel in the National Defence System. Hence, while planning defence resources,

it is important to ensure proper military provision of personnel, healthcare, social and other military

service-related guarantees. A lot of time and funds are devoted to the professional development of

military personnel. In Lithuania, as well as in other NATO countries, expenditures for personnel constitutes

the biggest part of the defence budget. Taking into account the military needs  and economic conditions


-----

|55555 33333 W H I T E|P A P E R|
|---|---|


of the country, Lithuania will seek to maintain personnel expenditures at no more than 50 percent of the

defence budget. Nonetheless, personnel expenditures cannot be cut at the expense of quality of life. In

reforming the armed forces, the numbers of conscripts and active reservists are being reduced and the

career system of professional service members is being reassessed. Other cost-saving measures are

also being considered.

**Infrastructure. At this initial stage of LAF modernisation, the highest priority has been given to the**

education and training of service personnel, and in particular, the improvement of quality of life and

quality of service.

Until 2000, considerable investment was made to the development of infrastructure. Modern service

and living conditions were created for the units of the National Defence System. A modern training

infrastructure was established, including the building or reconstruction of new barracks, catering facilities,

training blocks and firing ranges.

In the future, the main priorities of infrastructure modernisation and development programs aim at

improving the infrastructure of each military service in the following ways: the Land Forces – continuing

the reconstruction of barracks, training and leisure facilities, garages, depots and engineering hubs; the

Air Force – developing the Air Defence Battalion and the Air Base; the Navy – improving coast surveillance

posts; and the Logistics Command – improving logistics arsenals and depots. The program also aims at

infrastructure improvements of logistics battalions, the institutions of military training, the central polygon

training base, the system for supplying fuel to armed forces units, the general logistics system and other

projects.

In order to use resources in the most efficient way, priority will be given to extending the exploitation time

of existing infrastructure, adapting it to changes in the structure of the armed forces, modernising and

renewing it. Unnecessary infrastructure will be transferred to civilian authorities. In the future, infrastructure

investment should not exceed 3-5 percent of the defence budget.

**Weapons and Military Equipment. Taking into account Lithuanian commitments and the recommendations**

of NATO experts, expenditures on weapons and equipment procurement and modernisation and the

improvement of combat effectiveness will grow. Lithuania aims at spending at least 20-25 percent of its

defence budget on procurement (including procurement and modernisation of weapons and equipment).

From 2000-2005, the majority of weaponry modernisation projects were devoted to the provision of the

Land Forces and in particular the MIB “Iron Wolf” by procuring mid-range anti-tank weapons (“Javelin”),

combat and other forms of transportation, various light infantry weapons, mine search and de-mining

equipment, collective and individual NBC protection, and other necessary weaponry and equipment.

In the nearest future, plans are for the Land Forces to be equipped with anti-aircraft weapons (short

range air defence system “Stinger”), light weaponry and transportation means, and collective and

individual protection from weapons of mass destruction (WMD).


-----

|W H I T E|P A P E R 55555 44444|
|---|---|


Although the provision of the Land Forces and the MIB “Iron Wolf” in particular remain a priority, in the

future more attention will be given to other services. In the next few years, the Navy’s MCM ships will be

provided with more modern equipment and two MCM and multifunctional ships that meet NATO standards

will be acquired. Plans are also in place to renew tactical air transportation fleet and the helicopters fleet,

modernise long range radars, and implement other projects.

In the current security environment, Lithuania has to maintain such capabilities as anti-tank defence and

de-mining. In the future, however, the importance of anti-air defence, protection from NBC weapons, and

other modern capabilities will grow. Logistics support capabilities is another very important area that

needs to be considerably enhanced for Lithuania to be a full-fledged participant of NATO endeavours.


-----

|55555 55555 W H I T E|P A P E R|
|---|---|


**Development of a Scientific-Technological Basis. The success of developing defence capabilities is**

also dependent upon the ability of state institutions to cooperate with scientific and industrial establishments

and use their potential. The investment of the Ministry of National Defence into scientific research and

practical implementation of the research results may help keeping the LAF in line with the progress of

military technology. In 2001–2004, the Ministry of National Defence allocated some funds for the

modernisation of the scientific-technological base and for prospective fundamental and applied research

projects. In this vein, the Ministry has contributed to the provision of the Vilnius University Centre of Laser

Research, Kaunas University of Technology, the Semiconductors Physics Institute and other scientific

institutions with new technological equipment. These investments are already paying off: the scientists

of the Kaunas University of Technology have developed, researched and practically applied projects on

training and combat technologies; laser rifle trainers created by the Defence Technologies Institute of

Kaunas University of Technology are used in the Lithuanian Military Academy and the Training Regiment;

and successful mortar simulation try-outs were carried out in Lithuania’s polygon training bases.

NATO and the EU are also prompting Lithuania to get involved in defence technology research and

development activities of these organisations. Lithuania is among the leading NATO countries in terms

of per capita receipt of NATO funds for scientific research and development. The Ministry of National

Defence financially supports the participation of Lithuanian scientists in the activities of the NATO Research

and Technology Agency. Cooperation between the defence, science and industry sectors is beneficial

and should be strengthened as it creates conditions to improve the quality of defence capabilities, at the

same time giving economic benefits to national industry as well as fostering scientific progress.

In the future, Lithuania will have to maintain a proper balance between current and future needs, by

taking into account changes in the security environment, today’s threats, possible challenges of tomorrow,

and resources that are projected in the future.

#### 4.6 Defence and Society

The LAF are a constituent and indispensable part of society. The armed forces serve the state and the

interests of its citizens. Lithuanian citizens ensure democratic control over the armed forces through

elected democratic institutions – the Parliament (Seimas), the President, and the Government, which

determine missions for the armed forces, provide the funds and oversee their use. Close cooperation

between society and the military is essential for an effective defence of the country. Society is thoroughly

informed about the armed forces and defence reform, and constantly kept updated about important issues

concerning Lithuania’s defence policy agenda and the activities of the National Defence System. Cooperative

links are being built between the military and society, in particular involving the youth organisations, local

municipalities, educational institutions and non-governmental organisations.

Public support and trust is a major precondition for the armed forces to properly train and prepare to

execute assigned tasks and honourably represent the country in international operations. Lithuanian

society’s confidence in and support for the armed forces have been constantly growing in recent years.

Society’s supportive opinion toward the armed forces is the best evidence that defence policy and the

preparation of the armed forces have been moving in the right direction. A constantly active public relations

program has helped to achieve the support of almost two thirds of Lithuania’s population. Open and

transparent cooperation with society helps increasing the confidence and support of Lithuanian citizens for

their armed forces.

Society gets information about national defence through various means: the Ministry of National Defence

webpage (www.kam.lt); various publications (brochures, fliers, posters, etc.); informational films; photography

exhibitions; periodical military literature (“National Defence,” “Soldier,” “Sword,” “Volunteer,” “Cadet,”

“Mindaugietis”); and work with non-governmental organisations. Various events and festivals are being

organised: Partisans Remembrance Day, Unity of Armed Forces and Society Day, and Lithuanian Armed

Forces day.

The Lithuanian Riflemen’s Union is an important intermediary organisation between the armed forces

and society. It is a voluntary public organisation of civil self-defence that promotes citizenship values and

national self-consciousness of Lithuanian citizens and youth in particular. The Lithuanian Riflemen’s

Union has some 10 000 members, including more than 6 000 young riflemen of high school age. Among

other social activities, the Lithuanian Riflemen’s Union annually organises summer camps for children.

In the future, cooperation between the armed forces and the Lithuanian Riflemen’s Union will be developed

further.
