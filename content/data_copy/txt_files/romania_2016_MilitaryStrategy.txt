within Europe and Around the World - 
Blank page Romania finds itself in a security environment characterized by complex developments, which require on the one hand redefining its military power and on the other hand adapting its reaction in order to counter risks and threats against national security. 

Currently, our country enjoys strong security guarantees offered by its status as a member of the North Atlantic Alliance and of the European Union, and by its good relations with its neighboring countries and strategic partners. In this context, Romania's priority is to meet its obligations by developing its own defense capabilities in accordance with European and Euro-Atlantic standards and with its geostrategic profile. 

The Military Strategy is the document through which national defense and security policy is put into practice. It defines the framework for the development of the military for the defense of the country in an allied context. Based on the provisions of the National Defense Strategy, the White Paper on Defense and of NATO and EU documents, the Military Strategy provides coherence to concepts and actions required to carry out the missions of the armed forces and achieve the objectives of the defense policy. 

Strategic principles are defined in a modern vision, leading, in a logical progression, to the strategic and operational concepts which will become the basis for the role and use of the Romanian Armed Forces. Achieving and maintaining an adequate reaction capacity, in order to carry out missions, will be sustained through the allocation of specific resources at an appropriate level and through the use of the experience acquired in international missions and theaters of operations like Afghanistan, Iraq, the Western Balkans, the Mediterranean or the Gulf of Aden, and throughout the training process. 

To ensure an optimal level of coherence, flexibility, and institutional capability, the document seeks to materialize the directions of action regarding the configuration, size, training, and procurement of the Romanian Armed Forces. In this respect, implementing the Program of transformation, development, and procurement of the Romanian Armed Forces until 2026 and beyond, and the allocation of at least 2% of GDP to the Ministry of National Defense, ensure the necessary conditions for the continuation of the process of transformation of the Romanian Armed Forces and the completion of planned objectives, in accordance with its missions, responsibilities, and commitments. 

The Romanian Armed Forces will continue to guarantee that national sovereignty and independence, the unity and territorial integrity are preserved, and make an active contribution to regional and global stability and security. 

MIHNEA IOAN MOTOC 
MINISTER OF NATIONAL DEFENSE 
Blank page According to the Constitution of Romania, the Armed Forces are exclusively under the will of the people and guarantee the sovereignty, independence, and unity of the state, the territorial integrity of the country, and constitutional democracy. Under the law and under international treaties ratified by Romania, the armed forces contribute to collective defense in military alliance systems and take part in peacekeeping or peace enforcement actions. Carrying out these fundamental missions requires the identification of potential military risks and threats, the establishment of military objectives in agreement with national interests, the configuration of the most effective package of defense capabilities, and the setting of operational concepts on which the use of military force is based. The military strategy achieves these requirements through detailing the force structure and providing the guidelines for the planning of organisation, size, training and endowment of the Romanian Armed Forces over the next four years. Since the publication of the previous Military Strategy, the dynamics and complexity of the security environment have increased. The military conflicts in Georgia and Ukraine, the volatility of the security environment, the proliferation of terrorism, and the migration generated by the situation in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) represent a true paradigm shift in Romania's area of strategic interest. Security and collective defense assurances, provided by the status of Romania as a North Atlantic Alliance member, the solidarity and mutual assistance clauses within the European Union, and the strategic partnerships - of which the one with the United States of America is essential -, represent evidence of the democratic path and evolution that Romanian society made towards more security. A diversified spectrum of threats against our national security, and the obligations Romania assumed in the Allied context, require the Armed Forces to develop necessary defense capabilities at the right level of readiness, well-equipped and ready for action according to operational plans. The Military Strategy has an active-defensive character, and emphasizes the need to quickly adapt our posture and force structure to the complexity of challenges. The ability to accurately produce the desired effects by effectively engaging the forces assigned to the mission is dependent on the flexible architecture of the command structure, on the quality of the leaders, and on the initiative of the forces executing the missions. Reaction time will be very short, and challenges will combine in unexpected ways. It will not be sufficient for operations to be carried out in a joint context. They will also need to have an integrating character, fully correlated with the actions of other instruments of national power, within a coherent and flexible interagency framework. The concept of expanded national security requires the training of military personnel in understanding the role of national power structures and of international organizations in order to ensure the synergy of action of all actors involved in the area of military action. The Military Strategy offers the guidelines for a new generation of military leaders, with their character shaped in theaters of operations and experience gained in allied commands and encourages them to be innovative, flexible, effective, and oriented towards the achievement of the operational capability of the force structure of the Romanian Armed Forces.

# Chapter 1 - Introduction

Released under the provisions of Law no. 203/2015 on Defense Planning, the *Military* Strategy of Romania renders operational the defense dimension established in the *National* Defense Strategy for 2015-2019, specifies the implementation of objectives in the Governing Programme at the military level, and describes the ways and concepts derived from the provisions of the *White Paper on Defense 2016*. 

The starting point of the *Military Strategy of Romania* is the extended approach to national security, in which defense is merged and mutually balanced with the dimensions of law enforcement, intelligence, counterintelligence and security, diplomacy, crisis management, education, health, economy, energy, and demographics. Thus, the military instrument adapts its principles, missions, force structure, and capabilities to the new changes in the security context. 

Based on the assessment of potential military risks and threats, the *Military Strategy* outlines in detail the way that missions of the Romanian Armed Forces are carried out, and the guidelines for the configuration of the force structure in accordance with the defense policy objectives listed in the *White Paper on Defense*. It outlines the main missions of the military for a timeframe of four years, with medium and long term perspectives. 

Complementary to the other defense planning documents at the national and departmental levels, the *Military Strategy* is based on compliance with the *National Political* Agreement on Increased Defense Resources, on the implementation of the provisions of the Program on the Transformation, Development, and Procurement of the Romanian Armed Forces until 2016, and it takes into account the influences determined by the implementation of Allied reassuring and adjustment measures. The meaning of the main concepts and terminology used throughout this document is equivalent to the definitions presented in the Guide on the National Defense Strategy of Romania. 

## Chapter 2 - Potential Military Risks And Threats

Developments in the area of **global** security attest to the return of power politics, threatening, and military intervention performed on independent and sovereign states. The military instrument continues to remain a means to expand influence, to defend national interests, and to promote foreign policy objectives. The cumulated factors, which make a complex and extremely dynamic security environment, require the implementation of measures on several levels, in which the military one regains relevance. 

Europe is facing major challenges, with unpredictable consequences on its security. On the one hand, it is necessary to identify a coherent solution to respond to Russian Federation and hybrid threats' actions, which are more and more persistent at the eastern border, and on the other hand it is necessary to manage the wave of migrants from areas of instability in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA). 

At the regional level, certain states of tension persist. They are determined by both the tendency of state actors to undertake actions based on the logic of spheres of influence, by taking control in areas of strategic importance, and maintaining old ethnic, religious, or separatist disputes, thus challenging existing borders. The probable evolution of these tensions on the eastern border of Romania may generate a potential for conflict with a major impact on the security of our country. 

In the following period of time, trends in the security environment will probably follow the line of continued efforts for stabilization in areas affected by conflicts of various degrees of intensity in the context of confrontation between important geopolitical actors. The military dimension will constitute a fundamental element in the process of resolving security issues. 

Risks and threats of a military nature aiming at the security of Romania exist on several levels. As a NATO and EU member state, we have the obligation to participate in ensuring our national security and the security of our allies. At the same time, at the regional level we observe the destabilization of the security situation in the Black Sea Extended Region 
(BSER) on the background of actions undertaken by the Russian Federation to strengthen its areas of influence, of the phenomenon of migration, and of instability in the Western Balkans. 

The *development of military potential in the vicinity* of the eastern border of our country, materialized in the setting up and deployment of modern capabilities in the proximity of Romania, concurrently with the unfolding of processes of reorganization, modernization, and procurement of high-technology weapons systems, and the numerically increase of short-notice or no-notice large-scale military exercises, represent **the most important factor of military** risk against national security. 

Instability in the eastern proximity, present in the destabilizing actions in Ukraine and the frozen conflicts in BSER, along with autonomist-separatist trends - which include paramilitary elements - in regions with a significant presence of minority groups, can generate open conflicts in the vicinity of Romania's borders. 

Interethnic tensions and economic imbalances in the Western Balkans countries or east of Romania may lead to the reactivation of low-intensity local conflicts, which may turn into risks against the national security of our country. 

Inefficient measures to control the flow of migration from MENA and of measures to effectively integrate refugees in European society may affect the EU security architecture as a whole, and generate risks against all EU member countries, including Romania. 

Terrorism does not represent a direct threat at this time, but the geographic proximity to areas where terrorism is rampant and the participation of our country in actions to stabilize/rebuild areas of conflict may determine the promoters of terrorism to include Romania on their list of targets. 

Hybrid warfare, as a threat from a state or non-state enemy, that is using conventional and nonconventional methods and means in a vector-oriented and uniform manner, may represent a major risk against the security of Romania. 

Intelligence operations, as an effective way to destabilize target states, represent a special risk factor through the ability to create breaches in society, to weaken confidence in national governments, and to affect the cohesion of NATO and the EU. 

Proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, nuclear technologies and materials, unconventional weapons, and lethal means, continue to represent a significant threat. This threat is enhanced by the capacity of current vectors to carry to their targets, both conventional payloads, and chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear explosive devices. Similarly, the proliferation of high-precision weapons systems continue to remain a concern of state and nonstate actors, and the process is facilitated by access to technology. 

Cyber attacks are a complex category of threats through the increasing dynamic, global character, difficulty in identifying the sources of attacks and establishing effective countermeasures. The critical civilian infrastructure objectives, as well as defense communications systems and information technology equipment may be probable targets for such attacks. 

International organized crime represents a threat with military significance because, in a specific context, it can interfere with military operations through its action, consequences, and connections with others types of unconventional risks and threats. At the same time, Romania can be an area of transit for individuals involved in criminal activities such as illegal migration or arms trafficking and dual-use materials smuggling, but also as a target state for an opponent whose objectives may include military facilities on the national territory. 

Despite the fact that a **military aggression in Europe** is unlikely, the capacity to trigger such an aggression, increased by the presence of Anti-Access/Area Denial (A2/AD) capabilities in the Black Sea, represent the **main threat against the security of Romania** and other states in the region. 

Under these circumstances of existing of both conventional and unconventional threats, it is necessary to strengthen national operational capabilities, and to develop existing strategic 

## Partnerships And Cooperation With The Other Nato And Eu Member States In Order To Manage Potentially Destabilizing Situations. Chapter 3 - Missions Of The Armed Forces And National Military Objectives

Exclusively under the will of the Romanian people, in order to accomplish their sacred mission of defending the country, in the context of NATO's collective defense and of the EU's mutual assistance clause, the Romanian Armed Forces prepare, integrate at the national level, and - when necessary - under the law, make use of all available resources to fulfill their constitutional role regarding guaranteeing the state's sovereignty, independence, and unity, the constitutional democracy and territorial integrity of the country, as well as support the actions of allied states in situations of crisis, based on Romania's commitments and on decisions made at NATO and EU levels.

## National Military Objectives

The main objective of the Romanian Armed Forces is to strengthen the defense capacity at the national level in an allied and international context. 

The national military objectives for 2016-2019 are the following: - development the military capabilities required for the awareness, prevention, deterrence, and defeat of any aggressive actions against our country; 
- participation in the development of the integrated national crisis management system; - strengthening the military profile of Romania within international organizations and regional initiatives; 
- increasing allied presence on the national territory, concurrently developing the legal framework and completing the infrastructure projects required to sustain this presence; 
- contribution to the development of NATO's ballistic missile defense capabilities; - strengthening military cooperation within strategic partnerships, especially with the U.S., and to support diplomatic, information, and economic activities to promote national interests; 
- development initiatives of cooperation and partnership with the armed forces of neighboring countries; 
- supporting central and local authorities having a key role in the management of the emergency situations; 
- contribution to the resilience of Romanian society to unpredictable changes in the security environment. 

National military objectives are focused on the development of armed forces capable to provide the following **strategic-level effects:** 
- **deter** aggressive actions against Romania; - **limit** *the duration or influence of hostile military actions designed to generate a crisis* or a situation of instability; 
- **protect** the population and the territory; - **project** the military capabilities required to ensure dedicated participation within the framework of the new extended national security concept; 
- *strengthen the strategic credibility*. The **desired End State** is to achieve the joint action capacity of the Romanian Armed Forces and of the force structure required to achieve the level of ambition; deter a potential aggression; conduct defensive operations on the national territory to counter conventional, unconventional and/or hybrid aggressive actions until the intervention of the main allied forces; participate in accordance with assumed obligations in a NATO collective defense major joint operation, or in a EU-led high-intensity operation under the mutual assistance clause. 

 

## Guidelines For The Accomplishment Of National Military Objectives

The main effort will be in the area of personnel, military and civilian, engaged in actions to prepare and defend the country, with a focus to improve the quality of training. In this respect, we will intensify efforts to select, train, and retain personnel in the military, as follows: 
- selection will seek to attract those who have the qualities, capacity and desire to contribute to the national defense effort; 
- training and education will seek to impart relevance to knowledge and create the action skills required to carry out missions; also, they will seek to ensure the development of morale and willpower required to strengthen the cohesion, discipline, patriotism, and spirit of sacrifice; 
- special attention will be paid to the selection and training of leaders at all levels; - we will seek to improve the quality of life of personnel and their families to demonstrate the value placed on their activities and as a way to improve personnel morale. 

Modernization of existing military equipment, along with acquisition of new generation systems and equipment to military structures, will represent another important direction, as part of the effort to achieve national military objectives. This direction will seek to provide the weapons and military equipment in the amount and quality required for the defense effort. Furthermore, in order to achieve the integrated planning and action capacity at the NSS level we will initiate joint procurement programs within an interagency system. 

The third strategic direction, in close correlation with the first two, is that which aims to **adapt, transform, and develop the Romanian Armed Forces**, in accordance with politicalstrategic reality, and in compliance with allied standards. In this respect, we aim to: 
- maintain a high degree of readiness for the structures in the force package designed to provide the required Alert Status, and for the forces provided to the North Atlantic Alliance as part of the enhanced NATO Response Force (eNRF) and of the EU's Battle Groups (EUBG); 
- assume the role of framework nation in the implementation of initiatives to strengthen the allied presence in the region; 
- adapt the conceptual framework of task-grouping, training, and use of forces both on the national territory, and abroad; 
- establish and render operational intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) 
capabilities at the brigade and regiment levels; 
- increase the degree of force mobility and force protection; 
- develop and integrate the tactical, operational, and strategic command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (C4ISR) system, and interconnect them with NSS and NATO specific ones; 
- implement the system of recruitment, training, and use of voluntary reserve; - plan, organize, and carry out the preparation of the population, territory, and national economy through mobilization exercises to increase resilience and to cope with any security crisis. 

The Transformation system presented in the above-mentioned guidelines will be implemented through specific plans to achieve the established objectives.

## Chapter 5 - The Command And Force Structure Of The Romanian Armed Forces

The command structure ensures the leadership of the Romanian Armed Forces in peacetime, when a state of siege is instituted, a state of mobilization, and/or of war are declared. In peacetime, leadership is exercised by the constitutional authorities of the state on three levels - political, political-military, and military, as follows: 
- **at the political level**, leadership of national defense is exercised by the President of Romania, the Parliament of Romania, the Supreme Council of National Defense (SCND), and the Government of Romania; 
- **at the political-military level**, leadership of the Romanian Armed Forces is exercises by the Minister of National Defense; 
- **at the military level**, leadership of the force structure of the Romanian Armed Forces is exercised by the Chief of the General Staff/Chief of Defense. 

Upon institution of the state of siege, declaration of mobilization and/or war, leadership of military actions is exercised at the strategic level by the Commander of the National Military Command Center (CNMC), and at the operational level by the Joint Forces Command (CFI) and by the operational components/centers of NSS. 

Interagency relations are carried out through the implementation of the Concept of the Communications and Information System of the Armed Forces, which will allow the exchange of data and information in a comprehensive and secure manner, and the improvement of joint operating procedures. 

To accomplish specific missions and tasks, **the force structure** of the Romanian Armed Forces is defined from an organizational, operational, and actionable perspective. 

From an *organizational* perspective, the Romanian Armed Forces comprise of three Services: the Army, the Air Force, and the Navy. In order to accomplish specific tasks and responsibilities, within the armed forces there are established Military Intelligence and Special Operations Forces, Combat Service Support Forces, and Communications, Information, and Cyber Defense Forces. 

The Army provides the maneuvering, strike, and protection capabilities to achieve the deployment, presence, expansion, and continuity of land-centric military actions in the areas of interest for Romania and/or its allies, in peacetime, during crisis, and at war. It provides immediate response capabilities, and forces, which take part in international operations and missions and those assigned to the enhanced NATO Response Force and the EU Battle Groups, according to approved plans, on a rotational bases. 

The organisation of the Army will include: the Army Headquarters/Staff; two division headquarters (along with the relevant combat support and combat service support structures); 
eight combat brigades; two combat support brigades; one intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance brigade; and, three logistic support bases. 

The Air Force: defends the national airspace and the common allied airspace, renders operational and maintains the readiness of air forces and equipment provides support to the other Services, takes part in emergency situations and intervention in support of local authorities, and in fulfilling international commitments. 

The organisation of the Air Force will include: the Air Force Headquarters/Staff; five air bases; one air defense brigade; one intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance brigade; and one logistic support base. 

The Navy carries out military actions, independently or as part of multinational task forces, to ensure the integrity of sea and river areas, participate in national and international law enforcement operations in territorial waters, contiguous zone and exclusive economic zones, conduct sea maritime security operations and search-and-rescue interventions at sea and on rivers. Furthermore, it ensures permanent reconnaissance of the and of the Black Sea, provides support to the other Services and takes part in international operations and missions, according to approved plans. 

In order to carry out these missions, the structure of the Navy will include: the Navy Headquarters/Staff; one maritime fleet; one frigate flotilla; one river flotilla; one intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance brigade; and one logistic support base. 

The *Military Intelligence and Special Operations Forces* carry out specific land, sea, and air special reconnaissance, direct action, and military assistance missions, on the territory of Romania or abroad, independently or in cooperation with other national forces and/or allied forces, according to the law. 

The *Combat Service Support Forces* provide operational and sustainment support required by combat and combat support units, according to their areas of responsibility, trough specialized structures - transportation, logistic support, medical, maintenance, education, and training. 

These missions are carried out by structures of the Joint Logistics Command and include: one combat service support base, and two logistic support bases. 

The *Communications, Information and Cyber Defense Forces* provide, through their standing and deployable capabilities, combat support for the management, operating, and maintenance of the infrastructure, communications systems and services of, information technology, information security, and cyber defense, in the country and abroad. 

These missions and the leadership of these forces are accomplished through the Communications, Information and Cyber Defense Command; seven communications and information centers; communications and information combat support units for headquarter and formations within the Services. 

In terms of the NATO Force Structure, Romanian hosts the following: the Multinational Division Southeast Headquarters; the NATO Force Integration Unit; the Deployable Communications Module Element; and the Deveselu Missile Defense Base . 

From the *operational* perspective, the Romanian Armed Forces include: - *command, control and communications structures*: operational components of Services; the national Joint Force Command; the Joint Logistics Command; the Communications, Information and Cyber Defense Command; division headquarters, fleet headquarters, flotilla headquarters, centers of operations; 
- *intelligence structures*: intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance formations and units; 
- *engagement structures*: mechanized, infantry, mountain troops, special operations, tanks, artillery, military police, psychological ops, marine infantry units and/or formations, air force combat squadrons, air force training squadrons, attack helicopter squadrons, and sea and river warships; 
- *combat support structures*: surface-to-air missile, air defense, combat engineers, CBRN units and/or formations, sea mine laying and sweeping ships, Romanian and foreign military officials security detachments; 
- *projection and mobility structures*: tactical airlift squadrons, and transport helicopter squadrons; 
- *combat service support structures*: operational logistics units and formations for Army, Air Force, Navy and Communications and Information and Cyber Defense Forces; and, logistic support bases; From the *actionable* perspective, in order to carry out their military missions and tasks at the national level and within the Alliance, the Romanian Armed Forces develop: 
- *permanent ready-for-action* force package - for surveillance and early warning, in support of civil authorities, and counterterrorism; 
- *immediate response capability* force package - to avoid surprises and engage in lowintensity military actions, maintain integrity of Romanian airspace, integrated in the Extended NATO Air Defense System, control over territorial waters, and for deterrence and reaction, preparation to defend important objectives in strategic depth, and implementation of specific actions according to NATO crisis response measures, at the national level; 
- *rapid reaction capability* force package - to deter imminent aggression; - *strategic defense* and/or deterrence of aggression force package; 
- military structures *created during mobilization* for force regeneration purposes. 

The resources to accomplish missions and national military objectives include personnel, financial, technological, scientific, materials, and other resources, which will be allocated by the Government of Romania to ensure national defense as well as the fulfillment of international commitments. 

In the area of *human resources* the number of budgeted positions will remain constant throughout the entire timeframe of implementation of the political agreement, i.e. 81,129, and this stands at the basis of estimated personnel expenditures. 

The starting point for level of *financial resources* is the budget approved for 2015 and a gradual increase to reach the level of 2% of GDP in 2017 and maintain that level for the following ten years, according to the *National Political Agreement to Increase Defense* Spending. This level will allow for sustained multi-year budget planning of military spending in order to ensure the predictability of procurement policies for modern combat equipment, and for continued improvement of quality of life for military and civilian personnel. 

At the same time, financial resources ensured through NATO or EU programs, projects and initiatives will develop capabilities which support both the fulfillment of commitments made to these organizations, and specific missions and tasks at the national level. 

Material resources ensure the degree of equipment procurement stipulated in the NATO 
Capabilities Code, in accordance with the type of structure nominated for each capability separately. 

In the process of rendering operational the military structures, the planned level of readiness will be achieved through revitalization, redistribution, and functionality maintenance of the current equipment, and through the acquisition of new equipment by involving the Romanian defense industry in providing the products and services required by the Romanian Armed Forces. 

The major procurement programs will include planning and acquisition of the elements of integrated logistic support to ensure sustainability of equipment throughout its entire life cycle. 

Maintenance for military equipment will be provided mainly within our own structures trough supplies of spare parts and materials, testing and support equipment, personnel training, technical documentation and specific infrastructure, in facilities offered by the national defense industry and/or in framework of cooperation offered by NATO and the EU. 

Technological and research resources will provide the basis for the modernization of military equipment in order to develop the capabilities required by the Romanian Armed Forces to carry out its national defense missions according to established directions. 

## Chapter 6 - Strategic And Operational Principles And Concepts

Military strategy defines strategic and operational principles and concepts which ensure the accomplishment of national military objectives and missions. 

Maintaining their elements of continuity in ensuring the defensive-active character of Romania's Military Strategy, the strategic concepts regarding a **credible defensive capacity**, restructuring and modernization, and the **enhanced operational partnership** remain valid for the timeframe 2016-2019 with adjustments in actions according to the directions stipulated in the present strategy. 

The use of the element of military power to defend and promote national interests will be based on the following **strategic principles**: legitimacy, unity of action in an allied context, multidimensional interdependence, joint and interagency action, flexibility, strategic initiative, and proportionate response. 

Legitimacy is provided by having the Romanian Armed Forces exclusively under the will of the people and the conduct of any action only within a legal national and international framework. The use of force will observe the legal, moral, ethical, political, and diplomatic norms, and ensure the accomplishment of military objectives and missions. 

The principle of *unity of action in an allied context* is achieved in accordance with Romania's status as a member of NATO and the EU and with the participation of the Romanian Armed Forces in collective defense/ mutual assistance clause through a coherent approach to threats. 

The wide range of unconventional and asymmetric risks and threats, and the diversification of the types of crises and conflicts require an *interdependent* and multidimensional approach of threats, risks, and vulnerabilities and a *joint, interagency* response in hostile operational environments, in difficult geo-climate conditions by configuring a force structure adequate to the mission. 

According to the type, duration, and complexity of the missions, the Romanian Armed Forces develop and engage adequate capabilities, which are task-organized in a modular manner according to the principle of *flexibility*, in order to accomplish the full range of missions. 

Strategic initiative ensures competitiveness over time of the military and its purpose is to define the conceptual framework and implementation of defense policy objectives, configuring, sizing, training, and procurement for the Romanian Armed Forces and the transformation of the military structures. 

Proportionate response is based on compliance with the laws of war by correlating the means and procedures used to attain military objectives with the end results. 

Strategic and operational concepts, in the definition of the present strategy, describe the way in which the armed forces engage in order to attain established objectives and are ranked as follows: 
a) *Institutional concepts* - result from the *National Defense Strategy* and the *White* Paper on Defense and describe the way in which the Romanian Armed Forces contribute to ensuring national security in the context of implementation of the concept of extended national security; b) *Operational concepts* - define the implementation of the Military Art and Science and emphasize the way in which the armed forces take action in order to implement institutional concepts at the strategic, operational, and tactical level; c) *Functional concepts* - describe the way in which the armed forces act in specific/specialized areas. In order to justify the measures and actions undertaken to accomplish military objectives and missions the Romanian Armed Forces define, use, and implement - in principal and without limiting themselves to these, the following *institutional concepts*: 
- *strategic credibility* results from the *National Defense Strategy* and represents the full range of perceptions of third parties regarding the intentions, determination, and capability of the military to undertake and accomplish national defense objectives based on assumed commitments. Strategic credibility depends on: continuity in promoting principles and values; medium and long-term predictability in implementing decisions; transparence in planning resources necessary to accomplish objectives; development of military capabilities at the national level or within a multination framework; 
- *interagency approach and planning* is the fundamental operational concept through which the Romanian Armed Forces develop relations with all national institutions and structures with responsibilities in the areas of defense, law enforcement, and national security, as well as with international actors; 
- resilience requires the ability of NSS to withstand an attack and recover from an attack by developing sufficient capabilities to anticipate and deter a threat, to ensure conditions for victory and the optimal response solutions. The main measures which lead to strengthened resilience, with applicability not restricted to the military, are: identification of associated vulnerabilities and risks; development of an interagency decision-making process; civilian preparation and military sustenance of decisions made; available resources/reserves. 

The *operational and functional concepts* used in planning military actions are: - *integrated crisis management* - ensures the configuration of an integrated national system for: timely elaboration of national plans; timely and simultaneous achievement of intervention actions; integrated implementation of response measures; interoperability with the NATO Crisis Response System (NCRS), the EU crisis management system, and with other existing similar international systems; 
- *integrated protection* - ensures the elaboration and implementation of active and passive protection measures, on several levels, in air, land, naval, and cyber spaces of operations in order to deter risks and threats, preparation of capabilities for intervention, and of preventive engagement procedures; 
- *integrated logistics* - ensure the necessary framework and capabilities which will allow for the rapid deployment and sustenance of Romanian and allied forces on the national territory, in cooperation with the logistic systems of allied countries and the logistic systems of NATO's command structure, to include freedom of movement, rapid crossing of state borders, strategic and in-theater transportation. 

# Chapter 7 - Conclusions

The Military Strategy is the document of reference which expresses the fundamental orientations and options regarding planning, development and employment of the Romanian Armed Forces, in order to accomplish the defense policy objectives in a national and allied context. 

Based on the assessment of the international security environment and of the possible risks and threats to the national security of Romania, the *Military Strategy* presents, in detail, the missions of the Romanian Armed Forces in order to defend national and allied interests and values and seeks to achieve modern, flexible, and effective capabilities, able to conduct the full range of missions, from crisis management to high-intensity combat actions. 

In the context of supporting the security objectives stipulated in the National Defense Strategy and the *White Paper on Defense*, the Romanian Armed Forces will be capable to deter and defend a possible armed aggression against the national territory and to take part in deterring and defeating aggression in an allied framework. Romania strengthens its national defense and defends its national interests in the Black Sea and on the Danube River independently, until the activation of Article 5/NATO or Article 42/7/EU Treaty mechanisms, and through the development of its cooperation with allies in the proximity of Romania, and through regional military cooperation initiatives. 

The Romanian Armed Forces will also contribute to promoting regional and EuroAtlantic stability through participation in crisis-response operations under the command of NATO, EU, UN, and OSCE, and within coalitions. Not least, Romania will participate in ensuring homeland security in peacetime, in support of central and local public administration authorities, in situations of civil emergency, according to the law. 

The process of transformation of the Romanian Armed Forces at the same time with similar transformations in NATO and the EU requires the full implementation of the Program on the Transformation, Development, and Procurement for the Romanian Armed Forces until 2026 and Beyond. 

The comprehensive approach by establishing specific methods of interagency cooperation represents a primordial factor in achieving a logic and efficient decision-making process, and of an integrated, streamlined and standardized command and control structure. 

The objectives of the *Military Strategy of Romania* will be accomplished only by attracting and retaining adequately trained personnel, by training military leaders and by providing resources required for developing the capabilities of the Romanian Armed Forces. 

By carrying out their missions, the Romanian Armed Forces, subordinated exclusively to the will of the people, will remain the guarantor of the sovereignty, independence, and unity of the state, of the territorial integrity of the country, and of constitutional democracy.
