#### Tirohanga Whānui Overview

**National security is about protecting New Zealand from threats that would do**
**us harm. It is the foundation for New Zealand’s overall prosperity and wellbeing.**


New Zealand is a liberal democracy based on a
bicultural relationship and te Tiriti o Waitangi/the
Treaty of Waitangi. Our connections to the world
have brought opportunity, prosperity, and a more
diverse New Zealand. They are a source of strength
and resilience. And yet these connections also mean
New Zealand is exposed to global trends and an
**increasingly disrupted and contested world with**
direct implications at home.


This new level of challenge, as well as the need to
embed the lessons from the Royal Commission of
Inquiry into the terrorist attack on Christchurch
mosques, means it is time to update our approach
to national security.

This Strategy puts in place an approach focused on
**acting early and working together to create a more**
secure New Zealand, now and into the future.


APPROACH

VISION

At the heart of our national security approach is a whole-of-society vision:

###### A secure and resilient Aotearoa New Zealand— one that is protected as a free, open, and  democratic society for future generations

Our open society and democratic values enable New Zealanders’ diverse ways of life
and pursuit of opportunities. We advance this vision by working together across
New Zealand society, with our Australian ally, and international partners.

what government is doing to protect New Zealand,
and what role they can play. While government is
responsible for national security, New Zealanders can
contribute to our collective security and resilience.
New Zealand’s strong network of international

Every day the national security community
works on the issues that most directly affect
New Zealand’s national security interests.

These core national security issues include:

- Strategic competition and the rules-based

#### Kupu Whakataki Introduction

1. **New Zealand is deeply engaged in our region and the world. With this connection**
**comes opportunity, prosperity, and a more diverse country. Our openness to the world**
**is part of our identity—one of our greatest strengths and sources of resilience.**


2. But like other countries, New Zealand is affected
by global trends and an increasingly complex
international security environment. Where
we as New Zealanders once saw ourselves as
largely protected from threats by geography, we
now experience a virtual distance measured in
seconds and keystrokes. Threats are reaching
**New Zealanders more directly.**

3. In recent years, New Zealand communities have
seen and felt the impacts of national security
events first hand. Horrific terrorist attacks, growing
disinformation, and cyber-attacks on critical
national infrastructure have all left indelible
marks. Other harms, such as foreign interference,
may be less visible but are no less harmful to
our security. These challenges demonstrate that
**threats to our security can have international**
**or domestic origins and, increasingly, these**
**two elements are intertwined.**

4. This is just as true for our Blue Ocean Continent,
Te Moana-nui-a-Kiwa. Together with our Pacific
neighbours through the 2018 Boe Declaration we
have recognised an array of challenges to regional
security, including external interference and
coercion, cyber vulnerabilities, and transnational
crime, as well as the threat of climate change to all
aspects of the Pacific’s way of life. We must continue
to work together on these shared challenges.

5. Our national security depends on the rules-based
international system—the institutions, rules,
and norms that shape how New Zealand works
with the world, how our voice is heard, and our
interests realised.

6. The rules-based system is under sustained
pressure from several sources. This makes it
more difficult to foster international cooperation
on emerging challenges and to prevent crossborder threats. These threats are not future
challenges—they are already impacting the lives
of New Zealanders and New Zealand’s national
security today.


**Meeting the challenge on our terms**

7. These challenges mean it is time to update our
approach to national security—that we need a
new level of focus on protecting New Zealand
**from threats that would do us harm.**

8. Government’s approach to national security
is based on New Zealand’s unique character
and values. This starts with affirming the
foundation of te Tiriti o Waitangi/the Treaty
of Waitangi. This Strategy reflects government’s
duty, under kāwanatanga (governance), to
protect all New Zealanders. It is a starting point
for forging a stronger relationship between Māori
and the Crown in national security—a korowai
(cloak) of protection that both parties can weave
together. We are committed to developing a
national security community that promotes:

  - A partnership where both parties act
honourably, reasonably, and in good faith,
and where the Crown makes informed
decisions in areas of national security
that impact Māori interests.

  - Better understanding of, and ability to address,
the threats faced by Māori in order to actively
**protect Māori interests, which are broad and**
nuanced, extending from Māori themselves,
to property and culture, to the integrity of
New Zealand’s democratic institutions.

  - The participation of Māori in the national
security workforce, and the valuing of te ao
Māori in national security policy and practice.

9. New Zealand is a liberal democracy that upholds
human rights and civil liberties, and is committed
to being a good global citizen, supporting the
rules-based system, and working with our
international partners.

10. Even in a disrupted world, we seek opportunities.
We cut an independent path and at the same time
make common cause with those who share our
interests and values. Our partnerships are vital
to being able to protect the national security
of New Zealand and to promote our national
security interests regionally and globally.


-----

11. **Our vision for national security is positive**
**and intergenerational. It is about building**
a secure and resilient society that enables
New Zealanders’ diverse ways of life and
pursuit of opportunities.

12. Government’s approach to national security
focuses on prevention—to the greatest degree
possible, getting ahead of threats to New Zealand
whether they have domestic or international
origins. Acting early at home and overseas
is critical to protecting our security. Treating
threats early results in less harm for the whole
of New Zealand. This complements a consistent
focus on building resilience and readiness when
prevention is not possible.

13. We can all play a role in national security.
**Working together is essential. This includes**
cooperation across New Zealand society
as well as internationally. While government
is responsible for national security,
New Zealanders, our communities, iwi
and hapū, the private sector, academia,
media, central and local government, and
our ally and international partners all
contribute to a more secure New Zealand.

14. Working together across New Zealand society
means talking to people more openly about
national security. This begins with enhanced
transparency from government where possible.
While some information should remain
classified to protect New Zealand’s interests,
sources, and methods, government can make
more information available and accessible to
New Zealanders. A more informed society is a
**more resilient society, and this Strategy serves**
as a foundation for developing this conversation.

15. The national security community must also be
more joined-up. This involves stronger leadership
and clearer ways to hold government to account.


**What is in this Strategy**

16. New Zealand’s first National Security Strategy
adopts a new approach, incorporating
the lessons of the Report of the Royal
Commission of Inquiry into the terrorist
attack on Christchurch mosques. It also takes
a significant step forward in transparency,
openly describing the national security
challenges we face and the work of the
national security community.

17. **Part I describes New Zealand’s security**
**outlook and a new approach to national**
**security. This includes outcomes and priorities,**
with a Programme of Action that sets out steps
towards meeting these priorities.

18. **Part II describes government’s work**
in protecting New Zealanders through
examination of 12 dynamic and evolving core
**issues—those issues that have the greatest**
impact on our national security interests. It
also recognises broader drivers of insecurity—
**connected issues—which can have national**
security implications.

19. We will adapt to a changing world and build
a more secure New Zealand together.


This Strategy is an overarching approach for
national security. It complements a number of
existing strategies and policies, which remain
in effect, with updates to be guided by the
National Security Strategy. These include the:

- Countering Terrorism and
Violent Extremism Strategy

- Cyber Security Strategy

- Maritime Security Strategy

- Transnational Organised Crime Strategy

- Pacific Resilience Strategy

- Mass Arrivals Prevention Strategy

- Defence Policy Statements and White Papers

- National Space Policy

- Border Security Strategy

Strategic
competition

Challenges Transboundary
to democracy challenges


-----

**TIROHANGA RAUTAKI | SECURITY OUTLOOK**

31. Supporting the present rules-based system is
**more important than ever. This includes support**
for the rules-based system in the Pacific, which
has real impacts on how we and our Pacific
partners are able to pursue our interests and
protect our people.

**_Geopolitical change and rules at risk_**

32. Some of the most significant challenges to the
rules-based system come from authoritarian
countries violating rules and norms—including
undermining the sovereignty of smaller
countries—and efforts to change, erode,
or reinterpret the rules themselves.

33. **Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is a direct**
challenge to the United Nations Charter and
state sovereignty, and the source of great
human suffering. But even before this invasion,
we witnessed Russia challenging other states’
sovereignty, engaging in globally disruptive cyberattacks, and seeking to undermine democratic
elections in Europe and the United States. The
impacts of its efforts to spread disinformation
around the world have been seen in New Zealand
and the Pacific. All of these actions create
significant and wide-reaching disruptions.

34. **China’s rise is a major driver of geopolitical**
**change. China can play a significant role in**
addressing global challenges and is an important
relationship for New Zealand. Our national
interests require continued engagement with
China, and cooperation where our interests
converge. At the same time, China has become
more assertive and more willing to challenge
existing international rules and norms. We have
seen the building of military bases in disputed
areas of the South China Sea, and the use of
economic coercion. Chinese state-sponsored
actors have exploited cyber vulnerabilities in
New Zealand in ways that undermine our security.

**_Strategic competition raises the risk of conflict_**

35. Our wider Indo-Pacific region is at the centre of
strategic competition. There are concerns over
potential flashpoints including Taiwan, the South
China Sea, and the East China Sea. North Korea
continues to destabilise the Korean Peninsula.
In any of these instances, even tensions that fall


**short of full conflict could have unpredictable but**
**significant impacts on trade and supply chains,**
with global effects, including for New Zealand and
the rules-based international system.

36. More broadly, the erosion of the arms control,
disarmament, and non-proliferation architecture
has negatively impacted strategic stability.

**_Pressures in the Pacific_**

37. **Climate change is the single greatest threat**
to the livelihoods, security, and wellbeing
of Pacific peoples, with increasingly severe
impacts including sea-level rise, more extreme
weather events, freshwater shortages, pressure
on food stocks, and migration—both internal
and cross-border.

38. Additional challenges in the Pacific come
together as compounding pressures, including
development challenges, demographic and
resource pressures, economic issues like
indebtedness and inflation, transnational threats,
and more. This layering of challenges also
reduces the region’s resilience to the negative
effects of strategic competition.

39. **Increasing great power attention to the region**
brings opportunity in terms of finance and
investments. But how these investments are
made matters. We encourage countries from
beyond the region to work through existing
architecture, support Pacific priorities, and
to be transparent with their intentions.

40. China’s development cooperation has become a
key lever to achieve its long-term ambitions in the
Pacific. Its efforts to develop ports and airports in
the region bring the possibility that these could
become dual-use facilities (serving both civilian
and military purposes) or fully fledged military
bases in the future, which would fundamentally
alter the strategic balance in the region. The
2022 China-Solomon Islands security agreement
and ongoing attempts to create new groupings
in the Pacific demonstrate China’s ambition to
link economic and security cooperation, create
competing regional architectures, and expand
its influence with Pacific Island countries across
policing, defence, digital, and maritime spheres.


-----

THE PACIFIC REGION


**_Challenges to cooperation in a more_**
**_fractured world_**

41. Sustained engagement by the United States and
other like-minded nations in the Indo-Pacific and
the Pacific is critical for New Zealand’s security.

42. Unfolding competition is likely to continue to
promote increased cooperation among smaller
groupings of like-minded countries, such as the
Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, which includes
Australia, India, Japan, and the United States, and
the AUKUS security partnership among Australia,
the United Kingdom, and the United States.

43. As the number of groupings in the Indo-Pacific
continues to grow, New Zealand remains
committed to working closely with a range of
partners to preserve an open, inclusive, stable,
**and prosperous Indo-Pacific, both through**
opportunities to deepen our cooperation
with close partners and by upholding ASEAN
(Association of Southeast Asian Nations) centrality.


44. These challenges to cooperation mean it will
be difficult to create new rules of the road for
**emerging issues, from ethical standards around**
AI, to norms on geo-engineering in response to
the climate crisis, among others.

**Transboundary challenges**

45. New Zealand has long had to protect itself from
a variety of global transboundary challenges that
have the potential to cross our border and impact
individuals, iwi and hapū, our communities,
businesses, and both central and local government.
**Transboundary threats increasingly intersect**
with each other in complex ways, and technology
can extend their reach.

46. As we know from the tragic terrorist attacks on our
own soil, New Zealand is not immune from the
threat of violent extremism and terrorism. The
overall trend in developed countries is towards
smaller-scale attacks by lone actors using easily
obtainable weapons. There is no single pathway


-----

**TIROHANGA RAUTAKI | SECURITY OUTLOOK**

to radicalisation and then violence. In the online
environment, individuals will continue to engage
with content that reinforces personal grievances,
normalises violence, and exposes them to violent
extremist material.

47. **Disinformation will continue to pose ongoing**
threats to democracy and social cohesion around
the world, with the potential to undermine the
integrity of elections and the peaceful transition
of power.

48. **Foreign interference—an act by a foreign state,**
often acting through a proxy, that is intended to
influence, disrupt or subvert national interests
by deceptive, corruptive or coercive means—and
**espionage will remain a major challenge for**
liberal democracies worldwide. New Zealand and
our Pacific neighbours are and will remain targets
of foreign interference and espionage, with some
countries likely to keep trying to penetrate our
government networks, acquire sensitive research,
co-opt influential figures, monitor dissidents, and
influence media for their own benefit. Known
interference activities have been targeted at
New Zealand’s political, academic, media and
private sectors, and communities.

49. Powerful global suppliers remain focused on
growing the illicit drug market in New Zealand.
We will continue to be exposed to networks
dealing in illicit firearms, human trafficking
and people smuggling, and other forms of
**transnational organised crime. Technologies**
will enable these groups and networks to
engage in illicit activities and transactions
with growing anonymity, skill, and ease.

50. The cyber domain is increasingly a theatre for
strategic competition and profit. The likelihood
and disruptive impacts of malicious cyber
**activities impacting information systems,**
telecommunication networks, and information
technology infrastructures is growing.

51. **Emerging technologies such as AI,**
biotechnologies, robotics, and quantum
computing are developing rapidly and create
opportunities, but can also be used to enable or
commit harmful activity and have the potential
to create highly disruptive social and economic
changes. Countries will face stark choices related
to research and supply chains.


52. New Zealand has an expansive maritime area of
responsibility and faces a variety of challenges in
**maritime security, including threats to freedom**
of navigation and overflight, and maritime claims
that are inconsistent with the United Nations
Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).
Competition for marine resources in our region
is increasing, exacerbated by climate change,
marine pollution, biosecurity threats, and
over-exploitation.

**Challenges to democracies**

53. This dynamic mix of strategic competition and
transnational threats forms a challenging context.
**Many of these trends disproportionately affect**
**open societies.**

54. Globally, there is a sense that governments are
not able to solve the most pressing issues of our
time, from immigration to economic inequities.
This has led to populist movements, which have
moved several democracies towards more illiberal
approaches. Disinformation is an exacerbating
factor, becoming relevant where vulnerabilities
already exist.

55. New Zealand is not immune from the root causes
undermining democracy elsewhere, including
**growing wealth inequality, decreasing trust**
**in institutions, and a decreasing sense of**
**belonging, including among young people and**
those historically marginalised.

56. The pandemic has demonstrated that the exercise
of state powers in ways that affect people’s daily
lives can produce extreme reactions. This cycle
may well play out again in countries around the
world with regards to climate change policies,
and responses to other emerging threats that may
require changes to our ways of life.

57. Even in the face of new challenges, we believe
that democracy is the most resilient form of
government, and we will continue to protect our
open society for future generations.


-----

#### Te Whāinga Approach

58. **National security is fundamental to New Zealand’s prosperity and wellbeing. To**
**sustain strong foundations, we need a clear sense of what we want to protect at**
**home and abroad—a positive, intergenerational vision and a set of interests that**
**reflect who we are as a country, including our unique history, culture, and values.**


###### National security is about  protecting New Zealand from  threats that would do us harm.


PRINCIPLES


59. The agencies of the national security community
bring together a range of tools—diplomacy,
defence, intelligence, law enforcement, and
more—to promote and protect these interests.

60. To work towards our vision of a secure and
resilient New Zealand requires protecting
New Zealand from threats (Outcome 1), a resilient
society that is informed and engaged on national
security challenges (Outcome 2), and an effective
national security community (Outcome 3).

61. The national security community has identified
the highest priority actions to make progress
toward each of these three outcomes. These
priority actions recognise the pressing need to
adapt to meet the challenges of our evolving
security environment. Each requires continuous
improvement, including capability building and
investment in partnerships.

62. A Programme of Action describes how
government will advance these priorities over
the next two years. After this establishment
phase, government will issue a Programme
of Action on an annual basis.

63. In all the work the national security
community undertakes, it will be guided
by the following principles:


The national security community is committed to
building trust and confidence with New Zealanders.
This depends on being ethical and fair, reflected in the
concept of matatika. The community’s commitment
to protect New Zealanders is grounded in respect for
universal human rights and civil liberties.

**Māramatanga**
Acting with insight and understanding

The national security community is committed to
drawing on diverse sources of knowledge and insight
to understand our national security challenges, and to
enable Us to act early to protect all New Zealanders.


**Whakapai**
Fostering improvement

To better protect New Zealanders, the national
security community needs to adapt its approach as
the environment changes. The community embraces
the concept of whakapai—a reflection of an enduring
commitment to listening, learning, and to fostering a
culture of continuous improvement.

Protecting New Zealand from threats that would do us harm
means safeguarding:

**Our people, land, and waters**
Protecting New Zealanders at home and abroad. Ensuring our
continued territorial integrity, including our responsibilities to the
Realm, and safeguarding our wider maritime region. This involves
delivering on our search and rescue responsibilities, protecting our
Exclusive Economic Zone, and safeguarding our interests in the
sub-Antarctic Islands and Ross Dependency.

**Our independence and freedom of action**
Preserving our ability to take independent decisions and actions,
free from coercion at home, in the region, and beyond.

**Our democracy and social fabric**
Protecting the integrity of our democratic institutions, norms,
processes, and unique constitutional arrangements from deliberate
interference and safeguarding an open, inclusive society, grounded
in respect for universal human rights and the rule of law.

**Our national economic security**
Preventing and protecting against actions and developments that
threaten the viability of our national economy, including disruptions
to critical national infrastructure, supply lines, attacks on our financial
institutions, and economic coercion by foreign states.

**Our connections to the world, both physical and digital**
Protecting our information and communication technologies, undersea
cables, sea lines of communication, and our connections to space.

**A peaceful and resilient Pacific**

with our Australian ally
and international partners.

**Our people, land, and waters**

Tokelauans, Niueans and Cook
Islanders are all New Zealand citizens.
New Zealand is responsible for the
defence and security of Tokelau,
as a non-self-governing territory of
New Zealand. This is a responsibility
which in practice would only be
discharged in consultation with
Tokelau. The Cook Islands and
Niue are self-governing states in
free association with New Zealand.
New Zealand has a constitutional
responsibility to assist the Cook
Islands and Niue with defence,
if that assistance is requested by
their governments.

#### Hōtaka Mahi Programme of Action 2023-2025

64. **This section describes government’s Programme of Action to advance the**
**Strategy’s three priorities over 2023-2025. Following this establishment phase,**
**government will release future Programmes of Action on an annual basis.**


65. This Programme of Action sets out:

  - two major system-level initiatives and

  - further actions government will take
over 2023-2025, some of which are
recently underway.

66. Delivering on the Strategy’s priorities for change
will foster a more effective national security
community, better able to work together with
New Zealanders and international partners.

67. Building a more secure and resilient New Zealand
depends on the national security community
carrying this momentum across the key priority
areas identified in the Strategy for years to come.
The Strategy can only deliver change if it is
enabled by the right capabilities, legislation
and regulation, structures, and partnerships.


THIS PROGRAMME OF ACTION
BUILDS ON RECENT GOVERNMENT
INVESTMENT IN NATIONAL SECURITY


New Zealand has continued its efforts to support
resilience in the Pacific and establish closer links
with like-minded partners in the Indo-Pacific,
supported by investments in critical Defence
capabilities including upgrades of the ANZAC
frigates, and the introduction of the P8-A Poseidon
fleet. These capabilities will support peace and
security operations, maritime surveillance,
resource protection, and humanitarian assistance
and disaster relief in New Zealand, the Pacific,
and further afield.


In its response to the Royal Commission Report,
government committed to a range of national
security initiatives that will contribute to
implementation of the Strategy. These include
the establishment of He Whenua Taurikura,
New Zealand’s National Centre of Research
Excellence for Preventing and Countering Violent
Extremism, and investments in the intelligence
agencies to undertake critical work to prevent
and counter terrorism.

At the same time, government has enhanced
capabilities to help protect New Zealand’s
information infrastructure from cyber-attacks,
and commissioned new work to address emerging
national security issues, like disinformation.

New Zealand has continued its efforts to support
resilience in the Pacific and establish closer links

#### Ngā Take Whakamaru ā-Motu Matua me ngā Take e Kōtuitui Core National Security Issues and Connected Issues

68. **New Zealanders being engaged and informed on national security issues is critical**
**to building a more resilient society. This section explains New Zealand’s twelve core issues—**
**those challenges that most directly impact our national security interests.**


69. This is not an exhaustive list of everything
the national security community does. Instead,
it covers the main challenges that the people
working in national security deal with on a
daily basis to protect New Zealanders. Specific
events may arise that cut across several of
these issue areas.


70. The twelve core national security issues that
most directly impact our national security
interests are:
  - Strategic competition and the
rules-based international system

  - Emerging, critical, and sensitive technologies

  - Disinformation

  - Foreign interference and espionage

  - Terrorism and violent extremism

  - Transnational organised crime

  - Economic security

  - Pacific resilience and security

  - Maritime security

  - Border security

  - Cyber security

  - Space security


72. For many of these issues, the national security
community has established policies and
strategies in place. This overarching National
Security Strategy complements these policies
and strategies and will help guide updates to
them over time. Other issues represent emerging
challenges to our national security for which policy
is currently being developed. This set of core issues
will continue to evolve as new national security
challenges emerge.

73. In addition to the core issues, this section also
recognises a number of broader drivers of
insecurity, or connected issues—those that may
have national security implications through their
scale and magnitude. Examples of connected
issues particularly relevant to our security outlook
include climate change; biosecurity and human
health; social instability; and inequality, debt, and
corruption. These are areas in which other sectors
of government have frontline responsibilities, and
so the national security community must enhance
how it connects with these sectors and must be
consistently attendant to these issues.

74. Government is responsible for the security of our
country and all New Zealanders. Government
recognises that some communities are
particularly vulnerable to certain threats, and
that communities also have unique expertise
to offer in addressing them. For many of these
issues government cannot act alone—it must work
together with both domestic and international
partners to effectively address these challenges
and protect New Zealanders.


71. These core issues span drivers of insecurity,
**methods used by threat actors, and the domains**
that we are trying to protect, forming a highly
interconnected set.[1]


1. Issues can at different times belong in one or more of these categories—for example, cyber is a domain
that we want to protect but at times can also be used as a method to cause harm by threat actors.

**NGĀ TAKE WHAKAMARU Ā-MOTU MATUA ME NGĀ TAKE E KŌTUITUI | CORE NATIONAL SECURITY ISSUES AND CONNECTED ISSUES**


-----

|UNDERSTANDING|PREVENTING|PREPARING|
|---|---|---|
|Being able to efef ctively address these core issues requires policies that are built on a solid basis of understanding. This involves working together with many parts of society. It is also where national intelligence matters most. The National Security Intelligence Priorities (NSIPs)—Whakaarotau Marumaru Aotearoa—outline the government’s requirements for intelligence and support informed decision-making about our national security. National intelligence is produced by New Zealand agencies and our partners through the Five Eyes and other intelligence partnerships. Through these arrangements we can signifci antly enhance our capability to understand and assess threats to New Zealand’s national security interests.|Preventing harm to our people, our country, and our interests is both our highest priority and the most challenging outcome to achieve. Prevention begins with identifying points of intervention and requires matching tools from across the national security community (diplomatic, economic, defence, communications) with opportunities. This process must be intelligence-led. Interventions can include shaping and inful encing the security environment, for example through diplomacy and norm-setting in regional and multilateral forums. They may include enabling our partners to act through sharing information on threats and deterring behaviours harmful to our interests. Preventing threats from manifesting can also involve disrupting activities early, such as interdicting shipments of illegal commodities before they reach our shores.|Being prepared involves identifying vulnerabilities and building collective resilience to ensure that we are able to meet challenges and recover when needed. Actions to enhance resilience can include investments in infrastructure and ensuring that New Zealand society understands national security challenges. Being prepared can contribute to prevention by dissuading actors from challenging New Zealand’s interests. The National Risk Approach is key to resilience building. The national security community must be ready to respond—to act quickly and efef ctively when required. This includes regular preparedness and planning activities, and having clear escalation pathways to Watch Groups and the Ofifcials Committee for Domestic and External Security Coordination (ODESC), as needed.|

#### Ngā Take Whakamaru ā-Motu Matua Core National Security Issues


###### Tātāwhāinga ā-Rautaki me te Pūnaha i Poua ki ngā Ture ā-Ao Strategic Competition and the Rules-based International System

For decades, New Zealand has benefitted from a rules-based system that reflects our values and
supports our interests. Over recent years, strategic competition has intensified, impacting international
cooperation and challenging the effectiveness of the rules-based system. China’s growing economic,
political, and military power and more assertive pursuit of its interests abroad is a key driver of this
competition. Other countries that do not view the existing rules-based system as in their interests, such
as Russia, Iran, and North Korea, are exacerbating this dynamic. Strategic competition affects the full
spectrum of New Zealand’s national security interests, both at home and offshore.


75. Addressing strategic competition and challenges
to the rules-based system requires drawing on
all tools of statecraft and working closely with
international partners.

76. New Zealand’s approach to building readiness
and resilience at home is addressed through a
number of different policy areas, such as work
to counter foreign interference, which can be
exacerbated by strategic competition. Similarly,
government is taking a range of actions to
prepare for challenges to New Zealand’s maritime
security and economic security that stem from
increased competition.

77. Internationally, the government supports
international institutions, systems, and
international law, rules, and principles that
reinforce our values and interests—such as the
promotion of the rights and obligations enshrined
in the United Nations Convention on the Law of
the Sea (UNCLOS), the Nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty and broader regimes.


78. Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in
February 2022, New Zealand acted swiftly with
unprecedented diplomatic, economic, and military
support for Ukraine’s defence. This has included
implementation of sanctions and travel bans, NZDF
deployments, and support of Ukraine’s legal case
against Russia at the International Court of Justice.

79. The New Zealand Defence Force (NZDF)
consistently works to maintain presence and
respond to concurrent security events at home, in
our region, and further afield. This requires having
the capabilities and interoperability to effectively
do so, and working with regional partners to
support their own security.

80. Consistent efforts to support and build
architecture, rules, and norms feature across
our approaches to all other core issues, as
each of these areas relies on the resilience
of the rules-based system.


**Strategic competition emerges when**
countries seek to advance competing
visions for regional and global orders.


-----

###### Ngā Hangarau Whanake, Waiwai, Matatapu hoki  Emerging, Critical, and Sensitive Technologies

Emerging, critical, and sensitive technologies bring many benefits to New Zealand with the potential to
drive economic growth, domestic productivity, and environmental sustainability. At the same time, the
breadth of new technologies, their rapid pace of development, disruptive and unpredictable impacts,
and the lack of existing rules and norms governing their use present a range of challenges to our national
security. Emerging technologies can be used to enable or commit harmful activity, such as foreign
interference and espionage, violent extremism, and transnational organised crime, and may create
disruptive social and economic changes that we must adapt to or overcome.


81. Government takes a long-term, strategic view to
ensure New Zealand is prepared and responsive
in assessing and managing emerging, sensitive,
and critical technologies. Its approach is focused
on enabling New Zealand and New Zealanders
to maximise the benefits of technological
innovation, while managing any threats and
disruptions it might bring.

82. Government has developed tools to protect
New Zealand businesses and society from the
risks of such technology. For example, since 2020
there have been processes in place to assess the
risks posed by potential overseas investments in
New Zealand businesses that research, develop,
produce, or maintain sensitive technology. If
significant risks to national security and public
order are found, government has the ability
to block investments or create appropriate
safeguards by imposing conditions on an
investment transaction.


83. Government also works internationally to better
understand and mitigate the impact of these
technologies. This includes:

  - Shaping international rules and norms around
emerging technologies through international
organisations and multistakeholder forums.

  - Participating in agreements and initiatives to
restrict access to or eliminate certain sensitive
technologies (for example, the Wassenaar
Arrangement), as well as through New Zealand’s
own export controls system.

  - Exchanging technology foresight and horizon
scanning with partners and in collaboration
with academia and the private sector to
better understand and prepare for the future.


**Sensitive technologies have military or**
security uses. Critical technologies have
the capacity to significantly impact national
security, economic prosperity, and social
cohesion. Emerging technologies include
a broad range of new capabilities that are
in the early stages of development but
have the potential to be highly disruptive
or have transformative effects, depending
on their future application. Many of these
technologies could become critical or
sensitive technologies (or both).

**NGĀ TAKE WHAKAMARU Ā-MOTU MATUA | CORE NATIONAL SECURITY ISSUES**


###### Te Kōrero Whakatuapeka Disinformation

Disinformation is false or modified information knowingly and deliberately shared with the intent
to cause harm or achieve a broader aim.[2] Disinformation can be created and spread by other countries
as a means of foreign interference and by non-state actors from within or beyond New Zealand.
It has the potential to drive societal discord, grievances, and fears, and undermine trust in democratic
institutions. Though New Zealand probably has not been directly targeted by state-sponsored
disinformation campaigns, the spread of disinformation in the global information environment
may nevertheless threaten New Zealand’s security.


84. Government is seeking to support a whole-ofsociety approach to build understanding and
resilience against the harms of disinformation.
This is led primarily by those outside government
in recognition of the need to maintain openness
and uphold the right to freedom of expression.

###### Disinformation has the potential to drive societal discord, grievances, and fears, and undermine trust in democratic institutions


85. This whole-of-society approach has three
key initiatives:

  - Convening a civil society-led group to advise
government on options to strengthen resilience
to disinformation. This includes exploring the
design for a non-government entity to lead
long-term work on disinformation.

  - Establishing a fund to support community
projects and organisations in helping to build
New Zealand’s resilience and capacity to
respond to disinformation.

  - Commissioning public research and analysis
to monitor and analyse New Zealand’s online
information ecosystem, and the impacts
of disinformation.

86. To ensure that New Zealand is well-positioned
to understand and be attendant to the impact of
this issue, government has also created a new
intelligence priority focused on the national
security implications of disinformation.


2. This is distinct from misinformation, which is false or modified information though not created or shared with the direct intention of causing harm.


-----

###### Ngā Raweketanga o Rāwāhi  Foreign Interference and Espionage

All countries engage in foreign influence activity to shape perceptions and decision-making in other
countries. Such activity becomes foreign interference when it is intended to influence, disrupt or subvert
another country’s interests by covert, corruptive, deceptive or threatening means. This includes activities
by a foreign country to influence elected officials, explicitly or implicitly. Espionage refers to clandestine
activities undertaken to collect information, materials, or capability to obtain competitive advantage
at the expense of New Zealand’s security, international relations, and economic wellbeing. Foreign
interference and espionage present a significant and growing national security threat to New Zealand.
Government is building resilience to this threat in partnership with stakeholders across society.


87. The Countering Foreign Interference Work
**Programme focuses on managing risks to our**
democratic institutions and civil and political
rights, to economic prosperity (especially
protecting our critical infrastructure and sensitive
technology), and building our resilience to
economic coercion.

88. Acting early to prevent and reduce the impact
of foreign interference and espionage means
engaging with a wide range of groups—
communities, researchers, elected officials,
businesses, and other organisations—to increase
understanding, raise awareness of the risks, and
support better risk management. Government
initiatives to advance these goals include:

  - Published guides to support entities
to understand and manage foreign
interference risks.

  - Funding for the Ministry for Ethnic Communities,
to enhance our understanding of our diverse


ethnic communities’ experiences with foreign
interference to support their resilience.

89. Government continually reviews our policy and
regulatory settings to maintain our resilience
against foreign interference. It has undertaken
reforms to manage foreign investment risks, limit
foreign political donations, ensure the security of
our telecommunications networks, and limit the
export of strategic goods, such as military goods
and materials that could be used in the production
of nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons.

90. The Countering Foreign Interference Work
Programme will continue to consider how to
make New Zealand more resilient, for example
through the development of stronger policy and
regulatory settings. This includes considering
measures to promote greater transparency of
foreign country activity and the adequacy of
relevant criminal offences.

###### Te Whakatuatea me te Angahāruki Kaikoka  Terrorism and Violent Extremism

Violent extremism is an evolving threat, driven by increasingly complex and convoluted ideologies.
Terrorism continues to threaten the safety of individuals, the security of democracy, and the cohesion
of communities, globally and in New Zealand. New Zealand’s terrorism threat environment is dynamic
and influenced by both domestic and international actors and events.


91. New Zealand’s Countering Terrorism and Violent
**Extremism Strategy focuses on bringing our**
nation together to protect all New Zealanders,
with prevention as a priority.

92. New Zealand's approach to preventing
and countering all forms of terrorism
and violent extremism is based on te
Tiriti o Waitangi/the Treaty of Waitangi,
human rights, open government norms,
and the principle of proportionality.

###### New Zealand’s approach to countering terrorism and violent extremism focuses on bringing our nation together to protect all New Zealanders


93. Initiatives introduced in response to the
Royal Commission Report, which enable
us to act early to prevent and reduce the
threat of terrorism, include:

  - He Whenua Taurikura National Centre
of Research Excellence, producing and
coordinating research.

  - Kia mataara ki ngā tohu—Know the
signs, a guide for identifying signs
of violent extremism.

  - He Aranga Ake, an early intervention
programme working with individuals
displaying concerning violent
extremist behaviour.

94. While government maintains primary
responsibility, all New Zealanders can play
a role in preventing and countering violent
extremism. The annual He Whenua Taurikura
hui on countering terrorism and violent
extremism brings together a wide range of
participants and perspectives, to collectively
examine challenges and opportunities, share
insights and expertise, and advance solutions.

95. New Zealand also works closely with international
partners in regional and multilateral initiatives to
contribute to global efforts to counter terrorism
and violent extremism. New Zealand is a member
of the Australia-New Zealand Counter Terrorism
Committee, which enables trans-Tasman
cooperation. New Zealand, alongside France,
also leads the global implementation of the
Christchurch Call to Action to eliminate terrorist
and violent extremist content online.

###### Te Taihara Nahanaha Whiti Pae Whenua  Transnational Organised Crime

Transnational organised crime (TNOC) operates across national borders or is carried out in one country
with strong links to other countries. TNOC spans a wide range of illicit activities, including illicit drug
trafficking, financial crime, wildlife trafficking, cybercrime, and exploitation of people. TNOC is a
worldwide problem that undermines community wellbeing, governance, economic development,
and national security.


96. The New Zealand Transnational Organised Crime
**Strategy 2020-2025 provides the framework for**
a coordinated response to prevent and disrupt
TNOC that includes government, private sector,
communities, and international partners.

97. The Strategy coordinates a range of initiatives
aimed at bringing stakeholders together,
increasing our understanding and awareness of
TNOC, and aligning priorities to disrupt TNOC
threats impacting New Zealand. Activities include:

  - Strengthening our understanding of TNOC
through research projects in collaboration
with academia and building our insights
through the implementation of a strategic
intelligence fusion centre.

  - Delivering training and education material to
government, private sector and community
partners so TNOC can be recognised and
reported appropriately.

  - Aligning our policy and legislative settings
to make it harder for TNOC groups to operate
in New Zealand.

  - Supporting agencies to disrupt TNOC networks
through coordinated operational action.


98. New Zealand has a very strong enforcement
approach, working closely with our international
partners to target and disrupt TNOC networks.
The Resilience to Organised Crime in Communities
work programme complements these efforts in
focusing on the domestic context, addressing
social drivers of organised crime, wellbeing
harms, and building community resilience
against organised crime.

###### Te Manawaroa me te Whakamaru o Te Moana-nui-a-Kiwa Pacific Resilience and Security

New Zealand’s national security is intertwined with the security, stability, and resilience of the
Pacific region. Our geographic location and identity mean that we share in collective kaitiakitanga
responsibilities. New Zealand affirms our commitment to the Boe Declaration, the 2050 Strategy
for the Blue Pacific Continent, and Pacific regionalism. By supporting Pacific approaches and
priorities, we build resilience for all our countries.


102. The core of New Zealand’s Pacific Resilience
**Approach is partnership. How New Zealand works**
with Pacific partners continues to be as important
as what we do. The national security community
will continue to listen and reflect on what our
Pacific partners are telling us of their experiences,
share our own challenges and perspectives,
coordinate across issues and work together
to build shared resilience to the pressures our
region faces.

103. The Pacific Resilience Approach recognises
that national security risks often have a range
of underlying social, political, economic,
and environmental drivers. New Zealand has
committed to providing over NZ$1.8 billion in
development assistance to Pacific countries
between 2021-22 and 2023-2024 (budget years),
in areas ranging from climate finance, education,
health systems, governance and democracy,
infrastructure development, and more.

104. Government’s climate finance commitment is
NZ$1.3 billion for 2022-2025, of which at least
half will go to the Pacific region. The NZDF is
improving its capabilities to support responses to
challenges in the region, including the increasing
number of humanitarian assistance and disaster
relief missions associated with climate change.

105. The NZDF’s Pacific Leader Development
Programme implemented in Fiji, Papua New
Guinea, Tonga, and Vanuatu supports the
development of bespoke leadership frameworks
and training to enhance the professionalism of
security personnel.


106. Additional resilience building
programmes include:

  - capacity building by police—NZ Police
has eight capability development
programmes in 11 Pacific countries;

  - joint infrastructure developments;

  - strengthened cyber security protections; and

  - efforts to reduce and adapt to the impacts
of climate change.

107. New Zealand conducts regular maritime
surveillance in the Pacific to protect fisheries.
Patrolling also strengthens maritime security
through gathering intelligence to disrupt
transnational organised crime.

###### How New Zealand works with Pacific partners continues to be as important as what we do

**NGĀ TAKE WHAKAMARU Ā-MOTU MATUA | CORE NATIONAL SECURITY ISSUES**


###### Whakamaru-ā-Moana Maritime Security

New Zealand’s maritime security interests extend well beyond our immediate borders with our vast
maritime area of interest covering 1/12th of the world’s surface area. Maritime security involves
preventing, detecting, mitigating, and responding to risks introduced by illegal, malicious, unregulated,
unreported, negligent, or harmful (or potentially harmful) activities at sea. There are a variety of current
challenges that run counter to New Zealand’s maritime security interests, including maritime claims that
are inconsistent with UNCLOS and threats to freedom of navigation and overflight. New Zealand also
faces a significant seaborne illicit drug threat, and competition for maritime resources is increasing.


108. New Zealand’s Maritime Security Strategy
articulates how New Zealand delivers maritime
security for our nation and region. This requires
that the right people, processes, policies,
systems, and laws are in place to prevent and
reduce harm from threats. Government has
allocated funding to build this capability.

###### Deterrence plays a large role in preventing maritime security threats


109. Deterrence plays a large role in preventing
maritime security threats. This is achieved
through visible and sustained maritime patrol
efforts covering New Zealand’s Exclusive
Economic Zone and the high seas, with a
particular focus on the South Pacific, and
including the Southern Ocean. This presence is
currently provided primarily through Navy patrol
vessels and the new Air Force P8-A patrol aircraft
alongside the inshore surface patrol capabilities
operated by Customs and the Police.

110. New Zealand’s regulatory and law enforcement
agencies are ready to impose financial or
physical costs on those who actively undermine
New Zealand’s maritime security interests. The
Maritime Powers Act 2022 provides New Zealand
law enforcement agencies with powers to enforce
New Zealand’s criminal law in international waters.

111. New Zealand delivers maritime security through
a whole-of-government approach coordinated by
the National Maritime Coordination Centre, and
through partnering internationally. For example,
the NZDF contributes alongside partners to
securing maritime lines of communication and
promoting UNCLOS. In New Zealand, government
works with local iwi, the private sector, and
community organisations.

###### Whakamaru Pae Kati  Border Security

New Zealand’s border is one of our key interfaces with the world. It includes our physical border
and extends offshore and into the digital domain. Effective border security is about safeguarding
New Zealand and our people from threats, including transnational criminals, people smugglers,
human traffickers, espionage agents, illicit drug and firearm smugglers, terrorists and violent
extremists. The need for security is balanced with facilitating efficient flows of people, goods,
and information across the border to contribute to New Zealand’s prosperity and wellbeing.


112. In January 2021, government established the
Border Executive Board to strengthen existing
collaboration of border agencies and to develop
a Border Sector Strategy. Border security is
supported by the Transnational Organised Crime
**Strategy and the Maritime Security Strategy.**

113. Within New Zealand, managing border security
relies on agencies working together. Initiatives
such as the Joint Border Analytics Team and the
interagency Integrated Targeting and Operations
Centre bring staff together from border agencies
to share information and expertise, identify and
target risks to our borders, and disrupt
and reduce threats.

###### Effective border security is about safeguarding New Zealand and our people from threats, including transnational criminals, people smugglers, human traffickers, espionage agents, illicit drug and firearm smugglers, terrorists and violent extremists


114. Visa application assessments play a vital role in
preventing national security risk at the border,
as well as offshore passenger screening and
intervention. In addition, the Mass Arrivals
Prevention Strategy helps agencies to manage
the risk of maritime mass arrivals and supports
our international commitment to prevent
people smuggling.

115. Border agencies seek, where possible, to
manage or neutralise risk offshore before it
gets to New Zealand. This is achieved through
close cooperation with international partners.
Collaboration and information sharing about
threats improves collective understanding of
the challenges New Zealand faces.


-----

###### Whakamaru ā-Ipurangi  Cyber Security

Cyber security means protecting people and their computers, networks, programs, and data from
unauthorised access, disruption, exploitation, or modification. Malicious cyber actors, including
state and non-state actors, present a persistent threat to all New Zealanders as well as New Zealand
organisations, businesses, and government.


116. Since the publication of New Zealand’s Cyber
**Security Strategy 2019, government has**
undertaken a range of measures to influence
the cyber security environment and enhance
New Zealand cyber security capability.

117. The bulk of cyber security capability and effort
occurs outside government, with individuals and
private organisations working to protect their
data, networked devices, and infrastructure.

118. Government invests in multiple ways to assist the
wider public and business communities through:

  - Delivering advice and support to all
New Zealanders, including individuals,
Small and Medium Enterprises, and
Nationally Significant Organisations.

  - Providing advanced threat detection and
disruption services against sophisticated
and state-sponsored threats.

  - New Zealand Police’s investigation of
cybercrime and cyber-enabled crime.

  - Expansion of the Government Communications
Security Bureau’s (GCSB) threat detection
and disruption services for government and
private sector organisations to counter
malicious cyber activity.

  - The Department of Internal Affairs’
response to and prevention of online harms.


119. Government work is currently focused on
strengthening the cyber resilience of critical
infrastructure; improving cyber incident reporting,
access to information, and support available to
New Zealand organisations and individuals; lifting
collaboration between government and industry;
and developing a strong and capable cyber
workforce. New Zealand needs to ensure it has
the right cyber capabilities and tools to be able to
advance its national security interests.

120. Government also works with international partners
on cyber security issues, including on crossborder cybercrime and on cyber capacity building,
particularly in the Pacific, and cooperation to
promote a free, open, and secure internet. Law
enforcement agencies work with international
partners, including by sharing information and
intelligence to prevent cyber attacks at source
in other countries.

Many of the critical services New Zealanders increasingly rely on are supported by space-based
infrastructure, from weather observations to banking and financial transactions. Space-based
assets also help us observe our land and seas, understand climate change, and respond to natural
disasters at home and in the Pacific. However, our reliance on space assets also makes us vulnerable
to threats that would disrupt these services. Strategic competition and increasing space congestion
raise new risks that could adversely affect our space infrastructure and access.


121. Government’s new National Space Policy
outlines the values and objectives underpinning
New Zealand’s space policies, including
protecting and advancing our national
security interests.

###### We work closely with local industry and international partners to advance our common interests in space


122. Government’s approach to managing threats
from or to space includes:

  - Regulation—the Outer Space and High-altitude
Activities Act 2017 ensures that any payload
launched from New Zealand is not contrary to
New Zealand’s national security or national
interests and is compliant with our international
obligations and sustainable approach to space.

  - Partnership—we work closely with local
industry and international partners to
understand changing technologies, manage
risks, and seize opportunities to advance our
common interests in space.

  - International norms—we advocate for the
development of international norms and
standards that help reduce the risk to space
assets and ensure a sustainable and peaceful
space environment.

123. New Zealand actively cooperates with
international partners on space issues. Since
2015, New Zealand has been a member of the
Combined Space Operations (CSpO) defence
initiative alongside Australia, Canada, France,
Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United
States. CSpO’s goal is to improve defence
coordination, to ensure that space remains
safe, secure, and accessible to all.

#### Ngā take e kōtuituia nei  Connected Issues


In addition to these core national security issues, there are several broader drivers of insecurity—
issues connected to national security that can increase vulnerabilities and exacerbate threats
through their scale and magnitude. From population pressures, to social media, to the next
pandemic, there are a range of factors that can have security implications. Leading connected
issues that can drive insecurity include:


Āhuarangi Hurihuri | Climate Change

124. The effects of climate change will have major
impacts on food and energy security, and human
health and wellbeing. In future years, it will
increasingly aggravate population displacement,
economic dislocation, and resource scarcity.
Tensions will grow both within and among
countries as they attempt to secure their interests
in a changing environment.

125. Delayed global policy action against climate
change is likely to continue. Inequalities and
social divisions will be exacerbated not only by
the physical impacts of climate change, but also
by poorly planned and executed mitigation and
adaptation policies. Key areas of concern will
be impacts on water, sea levels, food, health,
critical infrastructure, and biodiversity. Pressure
may increase to deploy risky geo-engineering
techniques to prevent further warming.

126. At a regional level, water stress, flooding, and
extreme weather events will be acutely felt at
home and in the Pacific. This will increase Pacific
Island countries’ already high economic burden
of adaptation. There will likely be increasing
needs for disaster relief operations in the area.

**Biosecurity and Human Health**

127. Harmful pests, plants, and diseases entering
New Zealand can damage human and animal
health and wellbeing, impose additional burdens
on biodiversity and health systems, and harm
New Zealand’s economy, environment, and
diverse ways of life. They can also have significant
economic implications, limiting access to export
markets, and can endanger taonga plants and
native species, upset delicate ecosystems, spoil
our waterways, destroy wilderness areas, and
at their extreme, prevent us from freely moving
around our country.


128. Pandemics, like COVID-19 and influenza H1N1
2009 (swine flu), result in tragic loss of life,
have long-term health consequences, and are a
drain on economies and human development
worldwide, with long-term political and security
implications. While foremost a public health
issue, the recent pandemic has contributed to
political tensions, emboldened extremists, and
heightened division.

Pāhekeheke Pāpori | Social Instability

129. Social cohesion is where all individuals and
groups in society have a sense of belonging,
inclusion, participation, recognition, and
legitimacy. Socially cohesive societies are those
in which people have high levels of trust in one
another and in institutions. This is important
for social stability, a healthy society, and
New Zealand’s collective security and wellbeing.

130. Liberal democracies, like New Zealand,
are based on principles of trust—between
individuals, communities, and the institutions
of governance within a population. When any of
these dimensions of trust are weakened, social
cohesion is threatened. This loss of cohesion can
pose significant risks to democracies and drive
instability through disengagement and societal
fragmentation, creating vulnerabilities to foreign
interference, extremism, and civil unrest.

**Inequality, Debt, and Corruption**

131. Inequality of income, wealth, education, health,
and opportunity has grown and will continue to
grow within countries. This inequity drives social
discontent, which can undermine social cohesion
and contribute to a lack of trust in governments
and institutions around the world.

**NGĀ TAKE E KŌTUITUIA NEI | CONNECTED ISSUES**

132. Inequality among countries is also high and
expected to continue to grow over the next two
decades. Economic conditions in developing
economies continue to deteriorate, posing a
significant threat to their stability. The debt
burden in the developing world has been further
aggravated by the pandemic and will increasingly
become unsustainable for a range of countries.
This increases vulnerability to foreign powers and
potential for exploitation.


133. The challenges of corruption and kleptocracy
are receiving increased attention because of the
global reach of Russian money working in tandem
with state power, and other countries undertaking
similar influence activities. Corruption of elites
remains a concern, including when it comes from
foreign powers and in the context of development
projects. New Zealand and our region are not
immune from this challenge.
