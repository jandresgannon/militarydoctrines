**Article 3. Cyber Security Principles**

1. Cyber security is based on the following key cyber security principles:

1) non-discrimination of cyber space, which means that the provisions of legislation are

applied and benefits are stored both in physical and cyber space equally;

2) management of cyber security risk, which means that the applicable cybersecurity

measures must ensure that regularly assessed risks of cyber security entities are captured;

3) proportionality of cyber security, which means that legal, organisational and technical

cyber security measures, which are applied, shall not restrict the activities of cyber security

entities in cyber space more than required;

4) supremacy of public interest, which means that the applicable cyber security measures

shall first guarantee the protection of public interest, however, shall not, in principle, infringe on

consumer rights or limit their freedom in cyber space proportionally;

5) standardisation and technological neutrality, which means that when implementing

cyber security measures, cyber security entities shall be encouraged to follow the national, the

EU and other international communications and information systems’ cyber security standards

and specification, without demanding to apply any specific type of technology and without

giving it the priority;

6) subsidiarity, which means that cyber security entities, which operate information

systems and use them for the provision of services, are responsible for cyber security of

information systems as well as for services which are provided using such systems. In the areas

which fall within the exclusive competence of cyber security entities, the authorities which

develop and implement cyber security policy shall take measures solely when cyber security of

the communications and information systems and services provided using such systems cannot

be ensured by cyber security entities which manage such systems and use them for the provision

of services.

2. When applying legal provisions which regulate cyber security, consideration shall be

taken of the principles set forth in Article 3(1). These principles shall be inter-aligned and

coordinated; neither of them shall be given priority or prevalence.
