to the support for land operations and provision of
host nation support capabilities.
The National Guard serves as the main NAF reserve base that is being developed by attracting reserve soldiers and reservists and involving them in
public self-defence.
In order to facilitate Latvia’s contribution to international security and implementation of the principle
of collective defence, Latvia, together with Allies and
partners must participate in international operations.
Military integration of the Baltic States makes it possible to jointly develop capabilities that Latvia could
not develop on its own, as well as makes it possible
to increase our investment in the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization. The NAF must strengthen cooperation
with the Baltic States’ armed forces, more closely integrating the present and jointly developing new military
capabilities in long-term perspective.
The NAF also provides support to other state institutions, local governments and society, according to
the laws and regulations, using the available military
capabilities. In peacetime, the NAF, the Bank of Latvia Security Department, and the State Border Guard
ensure interoperability, taking into account that these
institutions operate under command of the NAF in
time of crisis.
In order to increase the effectiveness of national
defence, it is of decisive importance to ensure a longterm national defence funding mechanism, which
would provide for a gradual increase of national defence funding each year, so that it would reach 2% of
the gross domestic product in the future. It would be
necessary to achieve this objective by 2020, and this
is connected with the state economic growth and is
based on efficient use of the financial resources of
the defence sector, and is facilitating the development
and modernisation of the NAF. The concept should be
implemented in accordance with the state budget for


## Executive summary

The State Defence Concept outlines the fundamental strategic principles of national defence, mid-term
and long-term priorities and measures both in peacetime and in case national security is ­threatened.
The fundamental strategic principle of national defence is to minimise the potential for threats to national
security. By continuing to improve and modernise the
national defence capabilities, by strengthening North
Atlantic Treaty Organization’s collective defence and
by contributing to international security, both bilaterally and multilaterally, Latvia reduces the risk of external
military aggression or an outbreak of other national
threats, and, if necessary, is ready to ensure effective
deterrence measures.
The national defence capacity rests upon the
planned, coherent and coordinated political leadership, as well as the cooperation between state and
local authorities, the National Armed Forces (hereinafter — NAF) and society. It is a significant precondition for preventing and defeating threats to national
security and for dealing with consequence management.
The basis for national defence is the NAF, which
is being developed as a defence asset that is professionally trained and equipped with modern technology. In ensuring national defence, the quality of the
NAF capabilities is a priority. Likewise, the competitiveness of the profession of a soldier, his professional
development and motivation are of high importance.
Taking into account the national and collective defence needs, as well as the available resources for the
implementation of national defence, the development
of the Land Forces component, which forms the core
of the NAF capabilities, is a key priority for the NAF
capability development and distribution of resources.

# The State Defence Concept


-----

## Introduction

1. The State Defence Concept is a policy planning document that outlines the fundamental strategic principles of military defence,
priorities and measures for ensuring national defence. The State Defence Concept
provides guidelines for peacetime and in
case national security is threatened.
2. The State Defence Concept has been developed based on Article 29 of the National
Security Law, and is based on the Military
Threat Analysis. The State Defence Concept has been prepared according to Latvia’s geopolitical situation, national ­security
and foreign policy objectives, as well as
Latvia’s commitments as a member state of
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and
the European Union.
3. The State Defence Concept provides the
basis for planning specific national defence
activities, resources necessary for the implementation thereof, the development of the
National Armed Forces, the required readiness level and action of state and local authorities, individual and legal entities during
peacetime and in case national security is
threatened.
4. Taking into account the national economic
situation and the significantly reduced defence funding, the implementation of national defence activities and fulfilling the
legislatively defined functions and tasks of
the National Armed Forces is ensured in
accordance with the available resources.
However along with improvement of the


economic situation, the development of the
National Armed Forces must be continued
and the frozen projects must be resumed.
In the long run, no military capability shortfalls are allowed that would hamper the
completion of the tasks laid out for the National Armed Forces.

## 1. International Security Environment

5. The international security environment is
changeable, complex and difficult to predict.
Due to the globalisation process, Latvia
has established closer ties with countries in
different regions of the world. Consequently, any political, social, military or economic
instability, even in the remote parts of the
world can pose a direct or indirect threat
to Latvia’s national security. This fact constitutes the basis for planning the development of the National Armed Forces (hereinafter — NAF).
6. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (hereinafter — NATO) and the European Union
(hereinafter — EU) have a central role in
ensuring security, stability and cooperation
in the Euro-Atlantic area. The collective defence principle of NATO, along with the EU’s
mutual assistance clause, are a stable foundation for Latvia’s national security and defence that effectively helps to minimise any
external threat to national security.
7. As a country of the Baltic Sea region, Latvia is affected by everything that happens
in this region Military cooperation with the


Baltic States, the Nordic countries and the
United States of America, which is the most
important strategic partner for Latvia, is essential in providing security for Latvia and the
entire region.
8. While the potential for direct military confrontation on Latvian territory is relatively
low, it cannot be completely ruled out.
The outbreak of such conflicts cannot be
excluded also in the international security
environment, taking into consideration the
­rising military potential in various countries
of the world, as well as their efforts to expand their influence in world politics. Latvia’s security is strengthened by NATO’s
military power, which guarantees the capabilities to mitigate these threats.
9. In national defence planning, Latvia, like
the other NATO and EU member states,
takes into account global threats that may
affect the national security directly or indirectly, that is, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and the activities
of terrorist groups and radical extremists.
These threats are facilitated by international conflicts or instability in certain regions.
International piracy risk is significant as
well, as it threatens access to strategic resources or their delivery routes and has a
particularly negative impact on safe navigation. For ensuring national defence,
it is important to prevent any possible
risks associated with access to strategic
resources, paying particular attention to
the security of energy resource supplies,
as well as the security and sustainability


of crucial transport and communications
infrastructure.
10. New fighting techniques, technology development and application trends must be
taken into account while ensuring national
defence. Latvia, being a democratic country
with an open society, still must pay attention
to the information space, which may be used
to influence society and create domestic instability in crisis or peacetime. Cyber attacks
aimed at weakening the command, control
and communications are also very likely.
11. National defence and security are affected
by risks related to rapid technological progress, where the most negative impact may
be posed by a combination of high-technology with weapons of mass destruction and
electromagnetic weapons.
12. In the future, the most likely national threats
will be caused by hybrid attacks which will be
interconnected and difficult to predict. These
attacks will combine both conventional and
non-conventional methods of warfare, including terrorist attacks, organised criminal
activities, cyber attacks, information warfare and psychological operations. The adversary will be able to operate, affecting
both physically and virtually by land, sea,
air, space and cyberspace.

## 2. Strategic Principle and Key Tasks of National Defence

13. The fundamental strategic principle of the
national defence is to minimise the potential
for threats to national security By continuing


-----

to improve and modernise national defence
capabilities, by strengthening NATO’s collective defence and by contributing to international security, both bilaterally and multilaterally,
Latvia reduces the risk of external military
aggression or an outbreak of other national
threats, and, if necessary, is ready to ensure
effective deterrence measures.
14. The key tasks of national defence are to
prevent, defeat and overcome potential national threats, to guarantee statehood, the
capacity and continuation of state power
and existing order, to contribute to international operations, to support civil society
and engage in other emergency tasks in
accordance with national laws and international agreements.
15. The national defence capacity rests upon the
planned, coherent and coordinated political
leadership, as well as the cooperation between state and local authorities, the NAF
and society. It is a significant precondition
for preventing and defeating threats to
national security and for dealing with consequence management.
16. In order to be able to respond to traditional and other security challenges, rapid
response in early stages must be guaranteed; the NAF together with other state institutions, local governments, and society
must perform defence activities in support
of the arrival and deployment of allied forces. This requires an immediate situational
awareness, rapid decision-making and a
comprehensive approach, i.e., the use of
both military and civil resources In case of


a threat to national security, national defence
tasks are implemented under guidelines of
national political leadership, and the following
capabilities are guaranteed by the NAF:
16.1. a warning system;
16.2. a combination of military and non-military,
i.e., preventive measures (political, economic, diplomatic and security measures);
16.3. self-defence capabilities; and
16.4. a host nation support system for rapid
arrival and deployment of allied forces.
17. Likewise, the national security and defence are closely linked to the sense of responsibility and loyalty of civil society to the
Republic of Latvia. Social duty and patriotism are important factors that strengthen
Latvia’s security and statehood. Therefore,
during the implementation of national defence policy, dialogue between the armed
forces and society is constantly being encouraged, providing the public and youth
with patriotic education and increasing
knowledge in national defence matters, as
well as promoting civil awareness and esprit de corps.

## 3. Strengthening of National ­Defence Capabilities

18. Professionally prepared and trained, expeditionary and multi-functional NAF. The basis
for national defence is the NAF, which is being developed as a professionally trained and
comprehensively equipped national defence
asset. The NAF is ready to deliver effectively
the following operational capabilities:


18.1. to engage in threat prevention tasks both
within Latvia and abroad, including the
sustainment in operations for continued
periods of time;
18.2. to operate in multinational military formations and to ensure interoperability with
NATO and EU military units;
18.3. to adapt to threats across a variety of
conflict situations; and
18.4. to conduct operations in hostile operational environments and extreme conditions,
for example, the protection of units from
weapons of mass destruction, operating
under conditions of toxic threats and the
use of improvised explosive devices.
19. Priority is the development of the Land
Forces component combat capabilities.
Considering the national and collective defence needs, as well as the available resources (personnel, financial, etc.) for the
implementation of national defence, the
Land Forces component (primarily — active service units) development is the core of
NAF capabilities and a key priority for NAF
capabilities development and distribution of
resources. The development of other capabilities is closely tied to the support for land
operations and the provision of host nation
support capabilities.
20. nformation superiority, efficient and secure command, control and communications.
In support of the national defence tasks, a
rapid strategic and operational (including
geospatial) situational awareness capability must be in place, along with the effective
and secure command and control system


allowing to adapt to today’s security challenges, including also cyber attacks. Latvia
ensures the maintenance and operation of
a unified national and NATO classified information system, which, in case of threats
to national security, is provided by the NAF
together with NATO forces. In crisis situations, the NAF may take over the tasks,
authority and resources of the Information
Technologies Security Incidents Response
Institution.
21. A comprehensive approach to provide the
host nation support capabilities. As a matter
of efficient use of means and ways provided
by the collective defence system, the NAF
ensures the host nation support in close
cooperation with other state institutions,
local governments and society, as well as
in ­coordinated cooperation with the Baltic
­States, other allies and NATO authorities.
As for the fulfilment of this task and execution of the relevant operations, it is important to make available the required infrastructure, including civil aviation, maritime
and land transportation infrastructure, as
well as to ensure the appropriate engagement of local governments. The development of the host nation support capabilities
is essentially reinforced by the joint military
training of the allied forces and the NAF in
Latvia and in the other Baltic States, as well
as by the use of Latvian military infrastructure by allies for their needs in peacetime.
22. The transition from cooperation to integration with the Baltic States’ armed forces. Military integration of the Baltic States makes it


-----

possible to jointly develop military capabilities
that Latvia would not be able to develop separately. This requires mutual confidence and
trust, development of joint command and
control element of forces, coordinated development and interoperability. To promote
the military integration of the Baltic States
and to participate more effectively in NATO
collective defence system, it is important to
strengthen cooperation in areas such as
defence planning, military acquisition and
training, development of joint support units.
23. Priority is the quality of capabilities, not the
size of forces. In peacetime, the NAF is formed of professional service soldiers, the National Guards, civilian employees and the reserve soldiers of the NAF that ­altogether do
not exceed 17 000. In the national defence
system, the amount of professional service
soldiers does not exceed more than 5500
soldiers, while civilian personnel works in
the positions which do not require professional military knowledge.
24. The all-purpose capabilities of the NAF. The
NAF develops one and the same capabilities
both for national and collective defence tasks. The development of the NAF combat capabilities is aligned to NATO military capability development guidelines and requirements.
25. Sustainability and balance of the NAF
structure. The NAF provides the maintenance of a structure that primarily ensures
the fulfilment of combat, combat support
and combat service support tasks. In this
respect, it is necessary to review and determine new military grade structure While


planning the NAF structure, anticipated
demographic problems are taken into account, and therefore it is necessary to
sustain a flexible and modern recruitment
system. Here, it is important to strengthen
the Youth Guard movement by using the
assistance of the NAF regular force units
and National Guard. The stability of the
social security system is of no less importance, which, according to financial ability,
would allow finding effective solutions for
motivating qualified and experienced professionals to serve in the NAF. By promoting the sustainability and capacity of the
NAF structure, the NAF ensures the effective personnel career and professional development system, which would be directed towards:
25.1. ensuring the competitiveness of military
service in the labour market; and
25.2. professional growth and improvement of
combat capabilities of soldiers and National Guard by systematically raising the
military service proficiency and by participation in tactical exercises.
26. Procurement and logistics projects are
synchronised with the development priorities
of combat capabilities. Taking into account
the available resources, the acquisition of
modern equipment, transportation means,
weapons systems, as well as the introduction of modern technologies must be aimed
at maintaining and developing of the NAF
combat capabilities. In support of the NAF
unit deployment, maintenance and training process it is necessary to develop an


­appropriate multi-functional infrastructure
that would be suitable both for the NAF and
NATO needs. Bearing in mind the discouraging prospects of Latvia’s demographic
development, more attention must be paid
to technology-centric capabilities that do
not require significant staff resources. Procurement and logistics projects provide the
maximum support for the development of
the Land Forces component.
27. Development of the National Guard of the
Republic of Latvia aimed at strengthening
the NAF operational capabilities. The National Guard is a part of the NAF, and its
main purpose is to involve the citizens of
Latvia in national defence, thus providing
a link between armed forces and society.
The National Guard serves as the main
NAF reserve base that is being developed
by attracting reserve soldiers and reservists and involving them in public self-defence. Within the national defence system,
the National Guard provides:
27.1. support to other regular force units of the
NAF by maintaining the required specialised capabilities;
27.2. support for collective defence by participating in international operations and ensuring of host nation support; and
27.3. full integration and interoperability with
other NAF regular force units, building a
very close cooperation with the Land Forces Infantry Brigade in training and exercising, and in international operations.
28. Readiness of other state institutions to operate under command of the NAF to miti


gate threats to national security. To ­ensure
national defence in time of crisis, the National Armed Forces Law stipulates that
the Bank of Latvia Security Department
and the State Border Guard perform duties described in legislation and policy
planning documents under command
of the NAF. In peacetime, the NAF, the
Bank of Latvia Security Department, and
the State Border Guard ensure interoperability (regarding armament, equipment,
communications and training) and coordinate mechanisms for cooperation in crisis situations.
29. The NAF support to other institutions within the available military capabilities. The
NAF provides support to other state institutions, local governments and society, according to the laws and regulations, using
the ­available military capabilities. The NAF
provides support to the Security Police,
State Police, State Border Guard, State
Fire and Rescue Service, and other institutions, in the following cases:
29.1. resources at the disposal of these institutions are not sufficient for the implementation of emergency measures necessary
for crisis and consequence management;
29.2. involvement of the NAF resources considerably accelerates the implementation
of emergency measures; and
29.3. special resources (such as mine clearance and explosive devices, ships, aircraft
and off-road land equipment or specific
geo-spatial information) at the disposal
of the NAF are deemed necessary


-----

30. Effective and flexible mobilisation and reserve system. Mobilisation and reserve system meets the following requirements:
30.1. capable to support effectively the national defence tasks in crisis;
30.2. adaptive to the threat level, so that the
contribution made is adequate for the implementation of the NAF tasks; and
30.3. in a crisis situation, mobilisation resources (especially the material and technical resources) are used in a coordinated
and effective manner, including the assured availability of the required civilian­
resources.
In terms of human resources, the mobilisation and active service reserve system is
formed by the National Guards, soldiers
and reservists. In the medium term, the
most important tasks for the development
of the reserve system are to ensure the
proficiency of the National Guards and to
retain the maximum military skills of the
reserve soldiers by encouraging their involvement in the training process of the
National Guard or in the National Guard
service. In order to provide the appropriate
training level for the National Guards, it is
necessary to encourage employers to support their employees (National Guards) to
get involved in the military training process.

## 4. Strengthening of Collective ­Defence

31. Active participation in the strengthening
of the principle of collective defence The


principle of collective defence is enshrined
in Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, providing that an attack on one of the member
states of the Alliance shall be considered
an attack against all the member states.
This means that Latvia must be ready to
provide assistance in the protection of the
Allies, as well as to increase the contribution in the strengthening of NATO’s overall
military capabilities. It is within the interests
of Latvia to strengthen the solidarity of
the Allies and the ability to act rapidly and
effectively in any situation, including fully
implementing Latvian commitments and
taking active part in NATO institutions, as
well as in decision-making and consultation processes.
32. Strengthening of NATO Response ­Force
and military capabilities. It is within the
interests of Latvia to strengthen the rapid
response mechanisms of the collective
security system, which provides the ability to timely identify and anticipate potential threats. Thus, Latvia contributes to the
development of the Alliance’s ground surveillance capabilities and contributes to
the use of NATO’s common funding for the
development of the Alliance’s deployable
capabilities. Latvia strengthens NATO’s
political and military abilities to operate
effectively before, during, and after operations, including active participation in
NATO Response Force, as they first engage in crisis management and collective
defence operations. Effective functioning
of NATO’s crisis response system is a


precondition for the rapid response of the
Alliance.
33. Strengthening of NATO’s deterrence posture. In NATO, the military posture of the allied forces serves two purposes: on the one
hand, it deters from potential aggression,
on the other, it guarantees the political independence and territorial integrity of the
member states of the Alliance. This requires ensuring the most effective combination
of military resources that would be available
to the Allies. Taking into account the international security situation, Latvia believes that
NATO must maintain the nuclear posture
also further on. An appropriate mix of nuclear
and conventional forces is an important basis
for military response of the Alliance. In this
context, NATO’s missile defence capability is
an integral part of the defence posture.
34. NATO’s presence in the region. Along with
the approval of the new NATO Strategic
Concept, Allies have united in their commitment to provide visible assurance of
the solidarity and collective defence capabilities. The NATO Air Policing Mission is
the most visible presence of the Alliance in
the Baltic States. Latvia together with other Baltic States continues to provide host
nation support to the participating Allies.
Latvia’s priority is to have NATO’s Air Policing Mission on a continuous basis. Latvia
is also interested in promoting any other
expression of the Allied solidarity, including
the organisation of joint military exercises
and training with the allied forces and the
NAF in Latvia and in the other Baltic States


which is particularly important in strengthening the host nation support capabilities.
Permanent use of the Latvian civil and military infrastructure for the support of the
NATO forces strengthens Latvia’s security
and defence.
35. Pooling and sharing. The most effective
solutions for maintaining and developing
military capabilities are being sought in
NATO. In view of the Allies’ cooperation on
pooling and sharing of military capabilities,
the capabilities needed for the Alliance become more cost-efficient and available.
36. The European Union as a catalyst for the cooperation of European countries in the development of military capabilities. Latvia contributes to European military capa­bilities, which
enables Europe to contribute more effectively
in strengthening ­international ­security and
in closing the gap with the United States of
America in terms of military capabilities. The
EU for Latvia is an additional instrument for
strengthening national security and defence.
The Lisbon Treaty’s mutual assistance clause (Article 42.7 of the Treaty) specifies that
in the event of an armed aggression, the EU
Member States are obliged to provide the victim state with aid and assistance by all means
at their disposal. This clause has the role of
promoting political solidarity, but the Lisbon
Treaty does not provide a mechanism for
its implementation. Therefore, it is important
for Latvia to maintain a maximum degree of
national competence in the decision-making
regarding the EU security and defence policy
issues It is within the interests of Latvia to


-----

use the EU’s crisis management resources
and civil expertise, which nowadays allows
finding the most appropriate solutions to international crises. Latvia supports coordinated use of NATO and EU civilian and military
resources for solving security problems, as
well as supports the development of harmonious cooperation, while avoiding duplication
of functions. At the same time, the strengthening of the European military capabilities
must contribute to NATO’s military capacity.

## 5. Contribution to International Security

37. Latvia’s major contribution to international
security is to reduce or completely avert the
possibilities of armed conflicts. In the international security context, Latvia strengthens bilateral and multilateral relations with
its allies and other partner countries, taking
into account their international and regional
importance. Latvia as a member state of the
United Nations Organization, EU, NATO, and
the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (hereinafter — OSCE) contributes to promotion of stability of broader
common security space, fostering military
cooperation and security, arms control, mutual trust and information exchange and sharing of acquired experience in democracy,
the Euro-Atlantic integration, security and
defence sector reform.
38. Actively participating in enhancing the EuroAtlantic security, Latvia, along with allies
and partners participates in international


operations, pursues regional cooperation,
and provides support for defence reforms in
NATO partner countries.
39. Latvia’s participation in international operations, on the one hand, implements the
Alliance’s principle of collective defence,
on the other hand, allows greater involvement in global political processes, ensures
Latvia’s contribution to international security, and creates favourable conditions for
pursuing Latvian national interests within
NATO and the EU.

5.1. Participation in International
­Operations

40. Building the experience and preparedness
of all the NAF units. Participation in international operations ensures Latvia with continued growth of the NAF, which is essential
for the armed forces that are professionally based. In order to promote balanced
operational experience and the growth
of professional skills, all the regular units
are involved in international operations.
In this context, it is important to promote
the participation of the Naval Forces and
the Air Forces in operation areas. Also the
National Guard participates in international
operations thereby enhancing its capabilities and increasing the motivation of the
National Guard.
41. The NAF is able to participate in several
operations simultaneously. Taking into account the available human and financial
resources Latvia’s soldiers and civilian


experts are involved in NATO-led, EU-led,
UN-led and other international operations.
42. The NAF is able to sustain in geographically remote operation areas. The NAF
in cooperation with its allies must be prepared to participate in international operations in geographically distant locations
that differ from Latvia climatically, sociopolitically, economically and culturally. The
NAF must ensure the ability to deploy and
permanently sustain one platoon-level
unit in an area of operations 15 000 km
from Latvia’s borders, one company-level
unit at a distance of 5000 km, two company-level units with organic combat support
and combat service support capabilities at
a distance of 3000 km.
43. Increasing the contribution to NATO and
the EU High Readiness Forces. Latvia participates also in NATO and EU permanent
readiness formations, designed to be able
to respond effectively to the whole spectrum of crisis situations. Taking into account
the fact that NATO Response Force is an
essential instrument for collective defence,
Latvia must pay particular attention to the
contribution to those forces. Until 2016 Latvia’s total contribution to these forces is not
less than 390 soldiers. The NAF must be
ready to participate in the full spectrum of
NATO-led operations with one infantry battalion for up to six months without rotation
or with subunits not exceeding two infantry
companies or equivalent size specialized
subunits for up to six months with rotation.
The Naval Forces of the NAF must be ready


to participate in NATO’s High Readiness
Forces mine-countermeasures operations.
While developing national defence logistics
and supply system, it is important to create
expeditionary logistics capabilities which
are available to NATO. Latvia plans regular
participation in EU Battlegroups, taking into
account the involvement in other international operations.
44. Ensuring comprehensive approach. Stabilisation of situation and restoration of security in areas of international crisis require
a comprehensive approach that is based
on effective civil-military cooperation and
­coordination mechanisms. So:
44.1. The task of today’s international operations is to guarantee the security in the
region of crisis, promote the development
of the security and Defence Forces in the
region of crisis, the ability to manage the
situation in their territory independently,
and create conditions for further economic
and social stability. In crisis management,
not only military contribution, but also
effective and coordinated action of civilian
experts is increasingly important; and
44.2. Timely implementation of a comprehensive action and close mutual cooperation
of national and international organisations to reduce potential threats and promotion of international security are within
the interests of Latvia. In this context, the
cooperation and coordination of actions
of the United Nations, NATO, EU and
OSCE, as well as with non-governmental
and other organisations are crucial


-----

5.2. International Cooperation
and Support to Partner Countries

45. The United States of America is and will remain the key strategic partner of Latvia in
the field of defence and military matters. It is
important for Latvia to continue and deepen
the practical cooperation both bilaterally and
at NATO level. This cooperation is strengthened by joint participation in military trainings and international operations.
46. Military cooperation with the allies in the
Baltic Sea region plays an important role,
taking into account the traditional unifying
cultural and regional ties. It is within the interests of Latvia to promote the Baltic and
Nordic cooperation, promoting their unity
in terms of security and defence policy, as
well as deepening the cooperation of the
armed forces. Military cooperation with Poland and Germany, which have an important role in the security of the Baltic Sea
region, is of no less importance.
47. Active cooperation with the EU and NATO
countries that are interested in strengthening security in the Baltic Sea region. It is
within the interests of Latvia to promote the
involvement of other EU and NATO countries in resolving the security issues in the
Baltic Sea region, expanding the traditional
formats in the region of military cooperation
of the Baltic and Nordic countries.
48. Promotion of cooperation with the Russian
Federation is a security and stability strengthening aspect of the Baltic Sea region. It is
within the interests of Latvia to promote the


principle of openness and mutual trust in the
dialogue with the Russian Federation in bilateral contacts, and at the levels of the OSCE,
EU and NATO. There is a need to promote
military cooperation, for example, for ensuring maritime safety and search and rescue
coverage in the ­Baltic Sea, as well as promoting the involvement of the Russian Federation in trainings and exercises organised
for NATO partner countries.
49. Exchange of experience with NATO partner countries in implementation of defence
reforms. Latvia is actively cooperating with
countries whose foreign and security policy
objectives are the development of closer
cooperation with NATO and the EU. Latvia
is ready to share experience and provide
expert advice in the area of defence reform
for the South Caucasus countries and the
Western Balkan countries, Moldova and
other partner countries.

## 6. National Defence Planning

6.1. NAF Development and Operational
Planning System

50. When planning the development of the NAF,
the guidelines of the concept are observed:
50.1. The development of the NAF is planned
in the medium and long term, based on
the Military Threat Analysis, operational
study and in accordance with the National Armed Forces Law. To ensure a longterm operation and development of the
NAF based on the operational capability


assessment, a development plan for the
NAF is prepared, which aims at balancing the needs, resources and time of
the NAF. The development plan for the
NAF and this concept are the basis for
medium-term planning documents, including the guidelines on the development
of the national defence system that are
issued by the minister of defence, and for
the next year’s budget planning; and
50.2. The development planning process of
the NAF must ensure the continuity of
the implementation of the concept. Within this process, it is important to identify
core capabilities of the NAF for the fulfilment of national defence key tasks.
51. Guided by the State Defence Concept and
the Military Threat Analysis, the State Defence Plan, which specifies national defence
activities, priorities and necessary resources
and identifies the necessary readiness level
and responsibilities of institutions, individual
or legal entities involved in ensuring national
defence, is adjusted. This concept, the Military Threat Analysis, and the State Defence
Plan are the basis for the guidelines of the
minister of defence on the fulfilment of the
tasks of the NAF and operational planning
assumptions for the elaboration of the State
Defence Operational Plan.

6.2. Resource Planning

52. Ensuring long-term prospects. Strengthening national defence capabilities within
the framework of NATO collective defence


long-term financial prospects of national
defence funding are of decisive importance. In order to increase the effectiveness
for ensuring national defence, to meet
Latvia’s obligations regarding development
of NATO military capabilities, as well as to
provide a basis for long-term development
projects, it is necessary to ensure the stability and growth of the available funding over
a longer period of time. Taking into account
the economic situation and the bulk of the
state budget, national defence funding
each year would require a gradual increase
to ensure that the state funding for defence would reach 2% of the gross domestic
­product in the future. It would be necessary to achieve this objective by 2020, and
this is connected with the state economic
growth and is based on efficient use of the
financial resources of the defence sector,
facilitating the growth and modernisation of
the NAF. The concept should be implemented in accordance with the state budget for
the current year.
53. Achieving efficiency targets:
53.1. to implement development projects and
ensure timely renewal of equipment,
each year not less than 20% of the NAF
budget must allocated for the acquisition
of armament and equipment of the NAF.
At the same time, it must be ensured that
personnel costs do not exceed 50% of
the NAF budget, continuing the professional development, training and modernisation of the NAF, as well as providing that the administrative element


-----

of the NAF does not exceed 10% of the
total NAF personnel; and
53.2. for the increase in the capabilities of the
NAF unit deployment according to NATO
common policy planning, Latvia develops
capabilities in order to ensure that no
less than 8% (or 450 soldiers) of the NAF
total professional service personnel are
sustained in operational areas. No less
than 50% of the total professional personnel of the NAF should be deployable
in order to participate in NATO-led, EUled and other international organisationsled operations.
54. Support for economic development through
military acquisitions. It is possible to provide
the latter:
54.1. by participating in multilateral cooperation
projects, without which the development
of lacking defence capabilities in conditions of reduced defence budget would be
limited or even impossible, by organising
joint military procurement with other Baltic States, including offering them the use
of own training infrastructure;
54.2. by promoting the participation of Latvian
private enterprises in NATO military industry supply and transit chains that increases
the country’s export capacity and increases economic turnover opportunities;


54.3. by promoting the competitiveness of
private enterprises and development of
technologies, focusing on the involvement of local suppliers in the performance of large-scale military goods procurement contracts; and
54.4. by promoting the organisation of military
exercises and training in Latvia, which
enables the attraction of local businesses
for exercise support by providing various
services or the required infrastructure.

## 7. Final Provisions

55. The fundamental strategic principles and
the guidelines for ensuring national defence and development of military capabilities outlined in the State Defence Concept

Defence Concept within the scope of their
competence and the tasks set forth in laws

Concept not less than once during each
convening by 1 October of the second year
of its operation.
