**1. GENERAL PROVISIONS**

1.1. The Lithuanian Armed Forces are an integral part of the country’s civic
society. By executing the provisions of the Constitution, the laws and the National
Security Strategy of the Republic of Lithuania, the Lithuanian Armed Forces defend
the national sovereignty, territorial integrity, democratic constitutional order and
human and civil rights and freedoms. The society shall execute a democratic control of
the Lithuanian Armed Forces through civil state institutions.
1.2. The aim of the Military Strategy of the Republic of Lithuania (further on
referred to as Strategy) is to establish the ways of using the Lithuanian Armed Forces
in order to implement the state security and defence policy goals during peace, crisis
and war. This Strategy derives from the National Security Strategy 2004 and shall
replace the Lithuanian Military Defence Strategy 2000.
1.3. With the view to the changed security environment, the threats and dangers
emerging from it and following the provisions of the NATO’s Strategic Concept, the
Strategy shall define the military aims of Lithuania, the measures (strategic concepts)
needed for their implementation, the functions of the Armed forces and the military
planning guidance.
1.4. The Lithuanian Armed Forces play an important role in strengthening
relations with strategic partners, promoting regional co-operation and developing
friendly relations with the neighbouring countries based on an open dialogue,
transparency and confidence. By participating in international peacekeeping and crises
response operations, the Armed Forces of Lithuania, an active member of NATO and
the European Union, strengthen the national security as well as the security of the
whole Euro-Atlantic community.

**2. SECURITY ENVIRONMENT**

2.1. Euro-Atlantic integration. At the beginning of the 21[st] century, the
international community does not only face new challenges, but also acquires new
possibilities for establishing wellbeing and safe environment. The membership of
Lithuania and other Central and Eastern European countries in NATO and the
European Union has enhanced stability and security in Europe. Further Euro-Atlantic
integration bears a crucial significance for ensuring the long-term security of Lithuania.
2.1.1. Over the past decade, NATO has flexibly and successfully adapted to the
new security environment, has strengthened and expanded. The Republic of Lithuania
has become a member of the North Atlantic Alliance at an important moment of its
history. Collective defence is a key task of NATO activities; however, at the same time,
the role of NATO in enhancing international security outside the territory of the
Alliance has increased. NATO develops the work of the Euro-Atlantic Partnership
Council, the Partnership for Peace Programme, intensifies relations with Russia and the
Ukraine and promotes the Mediterranean Dialogue. In response to challenges and
threats to the international security, NATO has taken preventive measures, including
use of the military force.
2.1.2. The changed security environment and new tasks arising for NATO have
caused the transformation of the Alliance. With the view to the new challenges and in
order to achieve better efficiency, the NATO command and control structure is being
reduced, armed forces of NATO members are restructured so as to emphasise their
capabilities and reaction time, rather than their size and territorial defence. NATO
countries are reorganising their armed forces into modern and interoperable forces,


-----

capable of participating in operations of any kind including high-intensity operations
outside the Alliance territory.
2.1.3. Enlargement of the European Union into the ten new Central and
Southern European states has also contributed to enhancing the stability of the EuroAtlantic area. The European Security and Defence Policy, which is currently being
drafted, shall ensure better contribution of the European Union to strengthening the
international stability and security. The development of the European Union military
and civil crises management capabilities should be done in parallel and complement
each other.
2.2. Regional forums and multilateral projects also have a positive impact on
regional as well as global stability.
2.2.1. Close co-operation of Nordic and Baltic countries in the sphere of defence
enables a better co-ordination of actions in various international security organisations.
The experience of successful regional co-operation in the Northern Europe is used for
developing relations with farther situated regions of Southern Caucasus and Central
Asia, thus promoting expansion of the stability area.
2.2.2. The Vilnius Group remains an important forum in the Central and SouthEastern Europe for helping the countries, which are not yet NATO members, prepare
for integration.
2.2.3. Co-operation of the Baltic Sea region countries enhances the mutual
confidence among the countries and transparency of the security policy.
2.2.4. Elaboration of the Broader Middle East Initiative and Mediterranean
Dialogue is an important factor for strengthening inter-regional co-operation and coordination of fight against new challenges and threats. Their success is an important
condition for ensuring long-term global peace and stability.
2.3. Assessment of challenges, dangers and threats. The international security
tendencies are still contradictory. In some regions, military conflicts are on-going or
their probability remains high. In many regions of the world, the extent of danger
caused by non-traditional threats is increasing, the number of cases of use of military
force is growing. Terrorist attacks all over the world have demonstrated that no country
is fully protected against the threat of international terrorism. The probability that
terrorist groups or states related to such groups could obtain weapons of mass
destruction has increased. The problems caused by unequal wellbeing, radical
ideologies, industrial disasters or nature calamities are faced more frequently.
Although Lithuania does not consider any foreign state its enemy and the probability of
a military threat for Lithuania is insignificant, the probability of non-traditional threats
is increasing.
2.3.1. Conventional military threats. There is no direct military threat to
Lithuania at present. In the immediate security environment of Lithuania, there are still
countries where the democratic constitutional order has not been fully established and
where comparatively large military forces are preserved; therefore, the probability for
threats of a military character in the future persists.
2.3.2. Provocations, demonstration of military force and threat to use force.
Lithuania maintains friendly relations with all the neighbouring states and seeks not to
create a precedent for an international conflict by any deliberate or unintentional
actions. Lithuania acknowledges as legitimate the exercises and other military
activities executed in the neighbouring countries; however, it observes the military
actions taken in the neighbourhood in order to avoid erroneous identification of alleged
threats. The mid-term and long-term probability of the danger of provocation,
demonstration of force and threat to use force against Lithuania remains valid.


-----

2.3.3. Regional conflicts. The Alliance borders some unstable regions suffering
from internal conflicts caused by political, ethnical or religious clashes, which can get
out of control and expand outside the region. The unstable situation in those regions
may influence not only the neighbouring countries, but also the members of NATO and
the European Union, including Lithuania. Crisis prevention and management measures
implemented by NATO and other institutions on a permanent basis should reduce the
danger of expansion of regional conflicts.
2.3.4. Terrorism. Terrorism raises a serious threat for the security of the
international community as well as of the Alliance, the European Union and Lithuania.
For Lithuania, this threat is more of an external character, as the internal conditions are
not favourable for a terrorist network to appear. Lithuania can become a potential target
of the international terrorism or a transit country for terrorism against another state.
Lithuanian citizens abroad and Lithuanian soldiers participating in international
operations can also become victims of terrorist attacks. As terrorism still raises threat
all over the world, the probability of terrorist attacks against Lithuania and its citizens
remains imminent and can increase in the future.
2.3.5. Proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The number of countries
which seek to develop or acquire nuclear weapons is growing. Even more serious
danger is raised by unidentified owners of nuclear, chemical and biological materials
suitable for production of weapons. With regard to the growing number of countries
possessing weapons of mass destruction and increasing possibilities to acquire such
weapons for terrorists, the potential threat to Lithuania and its allies will not decrease.
2.3.6. Activities of foreign intelligence services. Although in the new security
environment the threat of a military conflict has substantially diminished, the danger
raised by hostile activities of foreign intelligence services is eminent and will not
decrease in the future.
2.3.7. Industrial accidents and ecological catastrophes. Although these threats
are not of the military nature, they can entail danger to the country’s citizens, their
wellbeing and have serious consequences for Lithuania and the whole region. The
probability of such threats is unpredictable.
2.3.8. Uncontrolled migration. Regional instability can raise uncontrolled
migration, when people in danger escape from violence or look for more favourable
living conditions. The danger of uncontrolled migration threatening Lithuania at present
is low, but it can increase due to unstable social and economic situation in the
neighbouring countries or outer regions.
2.3.9. Conclusions. The challenges, dangers and threats to Lithuania and its
allies are dynamic, often undetermined and sometimes unpredictable. Despite that, the
impact of the Lithuanian security environment on the national interests in the nearest
future is predictable. Although the probability of armed conflicts is low, the Lithuanian
Armed Forces, in co-operation with NATO forces, must ensure reliable deterrence and
defence against any potential aggression, provocations and threats to use force directed
against Lithuania and NATO. As a NATO member, Lithuania maintains the position
that a threat to the Alliance or any of its members is a threat to Lithuania. Lithuania
must also be ready to respond to threats and dangers related to terrorism, weapons of
mass destruction, uncontrolled migration, hostile activities of foreign intelligence
services and other factors that can endanger the state security and welfare.

**4. STRATEGIC CONCEPTS**

4.1. The Lithuanian Military Strategy is based on the following principles and
guarantees of the North Atlantic Treaty:
4.1.1. NATO countries settle disputes by peaceful means.
4.1.2. NATO countries should be prepared to develop their individual and
collective capabilities.
4.1.3. An armed attack against one or more of NATO countries is an attack
against them all and will receive defensive response according to Article 51 of the
Charter of the United Nations.
4.2. The Lithuanian Military Strategy is also based on the principle that in
forming the NATO and European Union forces Lithuania shall seek:
4.2.1. Commitment of single set of forces to both organizations.
4.2.2. A supplementary planning of forces and operations.
4.2.3. Co-ordinated decision making on the use of force and operations.
Only joint efforts by the European Union and NATO can strengthen the capacities of
the Euro-Atlantic community to react to international crises flexibly and to respond to
the arising challenges and threats.
4.3. Deterrence and collective defence. The aim of deterrence is to convince the
potential aggressor that it will face not only the forces of Lithuania, but also of its allies
and will experience great damages which will not be worth the sought result. A strong
NATO is the most important factor ensuring efficient deterrence. With regard to the
capabilities and the needs of the allies, the Lithuanian Armed Forces shall prepare for


-----

joint operations of full-spectrum. The national capabilities necessary for Lithuania so
that it could ensure sufficient deterrence and defence are as follows:
4.3.1. An efficient national crisis management mechanism. The national crisis
management system will ensure fast and timely decision-making in terms of use of the
Armed Forces on the basis of procedures and rules established in advance. The crisis
management system will maintain a permanent and efficient contact with crisis
management systems of NATO and European Union countries. Threats and probability
for their emergence will be evaluated on the basis of the intelligence data and plans to
counter them will be drafted.
4.3.2. National military units of high readiness. These well-trained, equipped
and deployable military units will be prepared to respond to emerging threats at any
time. These units will be totally interoperable with the relevant forces of NATO,
European Union and United Nations and will be capable of integrating into the relevant
military unit structure of the indicated organizations. Lithuania shall organize its
national military units of high readiness on the basis of categories of operational
readiness interoperable with NATO. The national military units of high readiness will
be able to react promptly to crisis, including those outside the Lithuanian territory. The
units of lower readiness will be ready to send specialist soldiers as well as combat and
specialized units capable of participating in international crisis response operations and
providing support outside the combat zone.
4.3.3. Airspace surveillance, control and defence system and sea and coast
surveillance systems integrated into the NATO system. The airspace surveillance
system of the Baltic countries (BALTNET), including the system of surveillance,
control and defence of the Lithuanian airspace, is a part of NATO integrated extended
air defence system (NATINEADS). The system of sea and coast surveillance will
ensure exchange of information with the airspace surveillance and control system and
will have an integrated control and management system. In co-operation with allies,
Lithuania shall also ensure airspace defence and prepare the entire necessary
infrastructure for execution of the air police functions.
4.3.4. The system of training and mobilization of the active reserve, which will
ensure fast and efficient use of state reserves during peace, crisis and war. Lithuania
will continue to modernize and develop the system of training and mobilisation of the
active reserve. In order to ensure the interoperability of the Lithuanian military units
with the forces of the allies, training and mobilization of reserves should cover the
national as well as NATO command and control procedures. The active reserve should
be able to act alongside NATO forces in an operation of any type and intensity inside
and outside Lithuania.
4.3.5. Infrastructure and forces enabling host nation support to the reinforcing
Allied forces. Lithuania is planning its defence assuming a guaranteed reinforcement of
NATO. In accordance to NATO requirements and host nation support procedures,
Lithuania is ready for permanent deployment of Allied forces and host nation support to
reinforcing forces.
4.3.6. Efficient and well coordinated military intelligence and counterintelligence activities. Lithuania will continue to develop its military intelligence and
counter-intelligence capabilities in order to indicate potential crisis at the earliest
possible stages. This will enable the country to take measures for preventing escalation
of crisis.
4.4. Crisis prevention and enhancement of stability. Lithuania will contribute
duly to the international operations led by NATO, European Union, UN, OSCE and ad
hoc coalitions implementing the goals of the indicated organizations. The aim of such


-----

operations is to carry out, through use of military force, conflict prevention, mitigate
the consequences of the existing conflicts, stabilize the situation and prevent conflicts
from expanding into other regions of the world. The Lithuanian Armed Forces will
participate in prevention measures against terrorist groups. For that purpose, Lithuania
will develop combat, combat support and combat service support capabilities. Lithuania
will participate in international operations only as a member of multinational forces. In
preparing for participation in international operations, Lithuania will have to ensure the
following:
4.4.1. Efficient participation in the international crisis management system and
decision-making. In enhancing the Lithuanian military intelligence capabilities and
exchange of information with the relevant services of NATO and European Union
members, it will be ensured that state leaders will adopt appropriate and timely

organization or an ad hoc coalition, the Armed Forces will at the same time revise the
priorities for allocation of resources so as these units could achieve the required
readiness before they are deployed outside the territory of Lithuania. Lithuania will
provide military units to the high readiness forces of NATO and the European Union.
4.4.3. Development of highly capable well trained and well equipped special
operations forces. The special operations forces are active part of the Armed forces of

terrorism of NATO and other organizations by its counterterrorist capabilities.
4.4.4. Rotation and maintenance of personnel in order to sustain the forces in
region of deployment for a long period of time. In preparations for deployment of
military units, actions shall be taken in parallel to prepare for personnel rotation and
replacement of respective weapons and equipment. This will help to ensure that the
capacity of the deployed units does not reduce in the case of long-lasting operations.
4.4.5. Education of soldiers able to participate in the military dialogue on
various security issues and communicate in the official NATO languages. In some
cases, for example, in applying the arms control regimes or confidence and security
building measures; the dialogue itself is an important component for ensuring stability.
4.4.6. Development of the specialised military capabilities. The Lithuanian
Armed Forces shall contribute its specialized capabilities in order to compensate
capability shortfalls of NATO.

services of Lithuania and allies, the appropriate agencies within the national defence
system take active and passive actions to ensure the physical and information security
in terms of protecting the national, NATO and European Union secrets and classified
information. The Lithuanian military intelligence upholds the procedures that enable
exchange of intelligence information with the intelligence agencies of NATO and the


-----

European Union members. It also contributes actively to neutralizing the threats
emerging due to the acts of spying, subversion, sabotage and terrorism against the
national defence system executed by foreign special services, organizations and
persons.
4.5.2. To enable the special operations forces to help other state institutions
neutralize terrorist attacks inside the country in a fast and efficient way.
4.5.3. To help the civil authorities, which provide support to the victims of
accidents and calamities. In order to ensure the wellbeing of society, the Armed forces
are ready to react to the threats of non-military character, the impact of which exceeds
the capabilities of the civil authorities to take appropriate measures. Lithuania will
ensure the most efficient use of the civil resources. In emergency conditions (war, crisis
or natural calamity) the Armed Forces should be ready to use the necessary means and
infrastructure at the disposal of the civilians and seek to preserve natural living
conditions for civilians.

the operations, to protect against the weapons of mass destruction and act in the
environment contaminated by nuclear, biological and chemical weapons.


-----

5.5.6. Efficient command and control – the ability to ensure the work of
advanced, interactive and mobile systems of command, control and communications.
5.6. In executing the reform of the Armed Forces, Lithuania is developing the
capabilities which strengthen the collective defence and are needed for implementation
of the national interests. The capabilities that do not correspond to these criteria are
reduced or disposed of.

**6. MILITARY PLANNING GUIDANCE**

6.1. Guidance for programming and budgeting. The Lithuanian Armed Forces
develop an efficient defence planning system corresponding to the systems of NATO
defence planning and strategic planning of the Government of the Republic of
Lithuania. The Military Strategy provides for the guidelines for the allocation of
resources for defence needs.
6.2. Priority programmes. In strengthening the Lithuanian Armed Forces, the
priority is set on development of capabilities necessary for defence of Lithuania
together with the NATO forces and for participation in international operations. Strict
compliance with the resource priority shall help achieve the goals set in the Strategy in
the most efficient way.
6.2.1. Personnel. Personnel training and management is one of the most
important priorities of the National defence system development. In order to ensure
better professional qualities of the Armed Forces, the following measures will be
implemented:
6.2.1.1. The number of soldiers in professional military service will be
increased, while the number of conscripts will be reduced respectively. The technical
nature of the modern equipment and requirements of modern operations require that
higher standards of skills be applied in training the persons suitable for military service.
6.2.1.2. The programmes of improving the quality of life and moral and
patriotic education will be continued. The military personnel is trained in line with the
traditions of the Lithuanian Armed Forces, the modern military science and experience
of the democratic countries, while also cultivating, civic duties, patriotism and ethics of
an individual soldier. The Armed Forces will look for new ways of making the military
service an attractive career prospect for the Lithuanian youth.
6.2.1.3. The programmes for training of Lithuanian non-commissioned officers
and officers will be continued and expanded by providing each of them with the
opportunity for professional training and development. The system of the military
personnel career is based on the principle of a centralised selection for promotion and
training subject to the individual merits of soldiers. Before each principal promotion,
non-commissioned officers and officers will have to complete courses or colleges of a
respective level.
6.2.1.4. The programme for training of the reserve soldiers is continued with
most attention focused on training of specialists for execution of new tasks.
6.2.1.5. The civil servants career system of the National Defence System is
being improved and will cover the official training programme, commendations for
service activities, promotion and appointments.
6.2.2. Training, readiness and sustainment. In distributing the funds in the
future, programmes of training, readiness and sustainment will be seen as priority. On
the basis of the NATO standards, the Lithuanian Armed Forces will draft the following:
6.2.2.1. An efficient training programme covering individual training to execute
the main operational tasks and training of units during the collective training exercise.


-----

Resources for training areas and infrastructure as well as support equipment and other
measures necessary for efficient training will be increased.
6.2.2.2. The programme for deployment and maintenance of equipment, with
most attention focused on supply and maintenance of the key equipment. The
Lithuanian Armed Forces will strengthen the capabilities and deployment abilities of
the military units and continue the creation of a flexible logistical system, which would
ensure deployment and sustainment of the military units.
6.2.2.3. The development programmes of the host nation support infrastructure.
Lithuania will continue close co-operation with NATO agencies so that the
implemented projects correspond to the priorities of the Alliance and enable the country
to receive financial support for infrastructure development.
6.2.3. Modernisation. In line with the set priorities, the Lithuanian Armed
Forces will implement modernisation plans. The Lithuanian Armed Forces, armed with
modern weapons will be able to operate more efficiently together with allies inside and
outside Lithuania. The Armed Forces will continue to be equipped with reliable and
modern armament and military equipment corresponding to the NATO requirements,
which will be procured in line with the set priorities with most attention focused on the
projects related to implementation of the NATO Force goals. Efforts will be made to
achieve that the funds allocated to procurement of new armaments and equipment and
modernisation of the existing equipment make up one fourth of all the expenses of the
National Defence System. The funds saved during the defence reform will be allocated
to the needs of modernisation of the Lithuanian Armed Forces.

**7. FINAL PROVISIONS**
