THE W HITE HOUSE

W A S H I N G T O N, D C

My fellow Americans:

T e American people elected me to make America great again. I promised that my Administration would
put the safet, interests, and well-being of our citizens fi rst. I pledged that we would revitalize the American
economy, rebuild our military, defend our borders, protect our sovereignty, and advance our values.

During my first year in office, you have witnessed my America First foreign policy in action. We are
prioritizing the interests of our citizens and protecting our sovereign rights as a nation. America is
leading again on the world stage. We are not hiding from the challenges we face. We are confronting
them head-on and pursuing opportunities to promote the securit and prosperit of all Americans.

T e United States faces an extraordinarily dangerous world, fi lled with a wide range of threats that have
intensified in recent years. When I came into office, rogue regimes were developing nuclear weapons
and missiles to threaten the entire planet. Radical Islamist terror groups were fl ourishing. Terrorists had
taken control of vast swaths of the Middle East. Rival powers were aggressively undermining American
interests around the globe. At home, porous borders and unenforced immigration laws had created a host
of vulnerabilities. Criminal cartels were bringing drugs and danger into our communities. Unfair trade
practices had weakened our economy and exported our jobs overseas. Unfair burden-sharing with our allies
and inadequate investment in our own defense had invited danger from those who wish us harm. Too many
Americans had lost trust in our government, faith in our future, and confidence in our values.

Nearly one year later, although serious challenges remain, we are charting a new and very dif erent course.

We are rallying the world against the rogue regime in North Korea and confronting the danger posed
by the dictatorship in Iran, which those determined to pursue a flawed nuclear deal had neglected. We
have renewed our friendships in the Middle East and partnered with regional leaders to help drive out
terrorists and extremists, cut off their financing, and discredit their wicked ideology. We crushed
Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) terrorists on the battlefields of Syria and Iraq, and will continue
pursuing them until they are destroyed. America’s allies are now contributing more to our common
defense, strengthening even our strongest alliances. We have also continued to make clear that the United
States will no longer tolerate economic aggression or unfair trading practices.

At home, we have restored confidence in America’s purpose. We have recommitted ourselves to
our founding principles and to the values that have made our families, communities, and society so
successful. Jobs are coming back and our economy is growing. We are making historic investments in
the United States military. We are enforcing our borders, building trade relationships based on fairness
and reciprocity, and defending America’s sovereignty without apology.

The whole world is lifted by America’s renewal and the reemergence of American leadership. After one
year, the world knows that America is prosperous, America is secure, and America is strong. We will bring
about the bet er future we seek for our people and the world, by confronting the challenges and dangers
posed by those who seek to destabilize the world and threaten America’s people and interests.

My Administration’s National Security Strategy lays out a strategic vision for protecting the American
people and preserving our way of life, promoting our prosperity, preserving peace through strength,
and advancing American influence in the world. We will pursue this beautiful vision—a world
of strong, sovereign, and independent nations, each with its own cultures and dreams, thriving sideby-side in prosperity, freedom, and peace—throughout the upcoming year.

In pursuit of that future, we will look at the world with clear eyes and fresh thinking. We will promote
a balance of power that favors the United States, our allies, and our partners. We will never lose sight of
our values and their capacity to inspire, uplift, and renew.

Most of all, we will serve the American people and uphold their right to a government that prioritizes
their security, their prosperity, and their interests. This National Security Strategy puts America First.

President Donald J. Trump

##### Introduction

An America that is safe, prosperous, and free at home is an America with the
strength, confi dence, and will to lead abroad. It is an America that can preserve peace, uphold libert, and create enduring advantages for the American
people. Put ing America fi rst is the dut of our government and the foundation for U.S. leadership in the world.

A strong America is in the vital interests of not only the American people, but
also those around the world who want to partner with the United States in
pursuit of shared interests, values, and aspirations.

T is National Securit Strategy puts America fi rst.


n America First National Security
Strategy is based on American principles, a clear-eyed assessment of U.S.

## Ainterests, and a determination to tackle the chal
lenges that we face. It is a strategy of principled
realism that is guided by outcomes, not ideology.
It is based upon the view that peace, securit, and
prosperity depend on strong, sovereign nations
that respect their citizens at home and cooperate to advance peace abroad. And it is grounded
in the realization that American principles are
a lasting force for good in the world.

“We the People” is America’s source of strength.

T e United States was born of a desire for life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness—and a conviction that unaccountable political power is tyranny. For these reasons, our Founders crafted and
ratified the Constitution, establishing the republican form of government we enjoy today. The
Constitution grants our national government not
only specified powers necessary to protect our
God-given rights and liberties but also safeguards
them by limiting the government’s size and scope,


separating Federal powers, and protecting the

rights of individuals through the rule of law. All

political power is ultimately delegated from, and

accountable to, the people.

We protect American sovereignty by defending

these institutions, traditions, and principles that

have allowed us to live in freedom, to build the nation

that we love. And we prize our national heritage, for

the rare and fragile institutions of republican gov
ernment can only endure if they are sustained by a

culture that cherishes those institutions.

Libert and independence have given us the fl our
ishing society Americans enjoy today—a vibrant

and confident Nation, welcoming of disagree
ment and differences, but united by the bonds

of history, culture, beliefs, and principles that

define who we are.

We are proud of our roots and honor the wisdom of

the past. We are commit ed to protecting the rights

and dignit of every citizen. And we are a nation of

laws, because the rule of law is the shield that pro
tects the individual from government corruption

and abuse of power, allows families to live with
out fear, and permits markets to thrive.

Our founding principles have made the United

States of America among the greatest forces for

good in history. But we are also aware that we

must protect and build upon our accomplish
ments, always conscious of the fact that the inter
ests of the American people constitute our true

North Star.

America’s achievements and standing in the world

were neither inevitable nor accidental. On many

occasions, Americans have had to compete with

adversarial forces to preserve and advance our

security, prosperity, and the principles we hold

dear. At home, we fought the Civil War to end slav
ery and preserve our Union in the long strug
gle to extend equal rights for all Americans. In

the course of the bloodiest century in human his
tory, millions of Americans fought, and hun
dreds of thousands lost their lives, to defend lib
ert in two World Wars and the Cold War. America,

with our allies and partners, defeated fascism,

imperialism, and Soviet communism and elimi
nated any doubts about the power and durability

of republican democracy when it is sustained by

a free, proud, and unified people.

The United States consolidated its military

victories with political and economic triumphs

built on market economies and fair trade, dem
ocratic principles, and shared security partner
ships. American political, business, and military

leaders worked together with their counterparts

in Europe and Asia to shape the post-war order

through the United Nations, the Marshall Plan, the

North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and

other institutions designed to advance our shared

interests of securit, freedom, and peace. We recog
nize the invaluable advantages that our strong rela
tionships with allies and partners deliver.

Following the remarkable victory of free nations in

the Cold War, America emerged as the lone super

power with enormous advantages and momen
tum in the world. Success, however, bred com
placency. A belief emerged, among many, that

American power would be unchallenged and self–

sustaining. The United States began to drift. We

experienced a crisis of confidence and surren
dered our advantages in key areas. As we took

our political, economic, and military advan
tages for granted, other actors steadily imple
mented their long-term plans to challenge America

and to advance agendas opposed to the United

States, our allies, and our partners.

We stood by while countries exploited the interna
tional institutions we helped to build. T ey subsi
dized their industries, forced technology transfers,

and distorted markets. These and other actions

challenged America’s economic securit . At home,

excessive regulations and high taxes stifl ed growth

and weakened free enterprise—history’s great
est antidote to poverty. Each time government

encroached on the productive activities of private

commerce, it threatened not only our prosperity

but also the spirit of creation and innovation that

has been key to our national greatness.

A Competitive World

The United States will respond to the growing

political, economic, and military competitions we

face around the world.

China and Russia challenge American power, infl u
ence, and interests, at empting to erode American

security and prosperity. They are determined to

make economies less free and less fair, to grow

their militaries, and to control information and

data to repress their societies and expand their

influence. At the same time, the dictatorships of

the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and the

Islamic Republic of Iran are determined to desta
bilize regions, threaten Americans and our allies,

and brutalize their own people. Transnational

threat groups, from jihadist terrorists to transna
tional criminal organizations, are actively trying

to harm Americans. While these challenges dif
fer in nature and magnitude, they are fundamen
tally contests between those who value human

dignity and freedom and those who oppress

individuals and enforce uniformity.

These competitions require the United States

to rethink the policies of the past two decades—poli
cies based on the assumption that engagement with

rivals and their inclusion in international insti
tutions and global commerce would turn them

into benign actors and trustworthy partners. For

the most part, this premise turned out to be false.

Rival actors use propaganda and other means to try

to discredit democracy. T ey advance anti-Western

views and spread false information to create divi
sions among ourselves, our allies, and our partners.

In addition, jihadist terrorists such as ISIS and

al-Qa’ida continue to spread a barbaric ideology

that calls for the violent destruction of governments

and innocents they consider to be apostates. T ese

jihadist terrorists attempt to force those under

their influence to submit to Sharia law.

America’s military remains the strongest in the

world. However, U.S. advantages are shrinking

as rival states modernize and build up their con
ventional and nuclear forces. Many actors can

now field a broad arsenal of advanced missiles,

including variants that can reach the American

homeland. Access to technology empowers and

emboldens otherwise weak states. North Korea—a

country that starves its own people—has spent

hundreds of millions of dollars on nuclear, chem
ical, and biological weapons that could threaten

our homeland. In addition, many actors have

become skilled at operating below the thresh
old of military conflict—challenging the United

States, our allies, and our partners with hostile

actions cloaked in deniabilit . Our task is to ensure

that American military superiority endures, and


in combination with other elements of national
power, is ready to protect Americans against
sophisticated challenges to national security.

The contest over information accelerates these
political, economic, and military competitions.
Data, like energy, will shape U.S. economic prosperity and our future strategic position in the world.
The ability to harness the power of data is fundamental to the continuing growth of America’s
economy, prevailing against hostile ideologies,
and building and deploying the most effective
military in the world.

We learned the dif cult lesson that when America
does not lead, malign actors fi ll the void to the disadvantage of the United States. When America
does lead, however, from a position of strength
and confi dence and in accordance with our interests and values, all benefi t.

Competition does not always mean hostility, nor
does it inevitably lead to conflict—although none
should doubt our commitment to defend our interests. An America that successfully competes is the
best way to prevent confl ict. Just as American weakness invites challenge, American strength and confidence deters war and promotes peace.

An America First
National Securit Strategy

The competitions and rivalries facing the United
States are not passing trends or momentary problems. They are intertwined, long-term challenges
that demand our sustained national at ention and
commitment.

America possesses unmatched political, economic, military, and technological advantages.
But to maintain these advantages, build upon our
strengths, and unleash the talents of the American
people, we must protect four vital national interests in this competitive world.


3


-----

First, our fundamental responsibility is to
**protect the American people, the homeland,**
**and the American way of life. We will strengthen**
control of our borders and reform our immigration system. We will protect our critical infrastructure and go after malicious cyber actors. A layered
missile defense system will defend our homeland
against missile at acks. And we will pursue threats
to their source, so that jihadist terrorists are
stopped before they ever reach our borders.

Second, we will promote American prosperity.
We will rejuvenate the American economy for
the benefit of American workers and companies.
We will insist upon fair and reciprocal economic
relationships to address trade imbalances. The
United States must preserve our lead in research
and technology and protect our economy from
competitors who unfairly acquire our intellectual property. And we will embrace America’s
energy dominance because unleashing abundant
energy resources stimulates our economy.

Third, we will preserve peace through strength
by rebuilding our military so that it remains preeminent, deters our adversaries, and if necessary,
is able to fight and win. We will compete with all
tools of national power to ensure that regions of
the world are not dominated by one power. We
will strengthen America’s capabilities—including in space and cyberspace—and revitalize others that have been neglected. Allies and partners
magnify our power. We expect them to shoulder a fair share of the burden of responsibility to protect against common threats.

Fourth, we will advance American influence
because a world that supports American interests and reflects our values makes America more
secure and prosperous. We will compete and lead
in multilateral organizations so that American
interests and principles are protected. America’s
commitment to libert, democracy, and the rule of
law serves as an inspiration for those living under


t ranny. We can play a catalytic role in promoting
private-sector-led economic growth, helping aspiring partners become future trading and security
partners. And we will remain a generous nation,
even as we expect others to share responsibilit .

Strengthening our sovereignty—the first duty of
a government is to serve the interests of its own
people—is a necessary condition for protecting
these four national interests. And as we strengthen
our sovereignty we will renew confidence in ourselves as a nation. We are proud of our history,
optimistic about America’s future, and confident
of the positive example the United States of ers to
the world. We are also realistic and understand
that the American way of life cannot be imposed
upon others, nor is it the inevitable culmination
of progress. Together with our allies, partners,
and aspiring partners, the United States will pursue cooperation with reciprocity. Cooperation
means sharing responsibilities and burdens.
In trade, fair and reciprocal relationships benefit all with equal levels of market access and
opportunities for economic growth. An America
First National Security Strategy appreciates that
America will catalyze conditions to unleash economic success for America and the world.

In the United States, free men and women have
created the most just and prosperous nation in
history. Our generation of Americans is now
charged with preserving and defending that
precious inheritance. This National Security
Strategy shows the way.

his National Security Strategy begins
with the determination to protect the
American people, the American way

### Tof life, and American interests. Americans have

long recognized the benefi ts of an interconnected

world, where information and commerce flow

freely. Engaging with the world, however, does

not mean the United States should abandon its

rights and duties as a sovereign state or compro
mise its security. Openness also imposes costs,

since adversaries exploit our free and demo
cratic system to harm the United States.

North Korea seeks the capabilit to kill millions of

Americans with nuclear weapons. Iran supports

terrorist groups and openly calls for our destruc
tion. Jihadist terrorist organizations such as ISIS

and al-Qa’ida are determined to at ack the United

States and radicalize Americans with their hate
ful ideology. Non-state actors undermine social

order through drug and human trafficking net
works, which they use to commit violent crimes

and kill thousands of American each year.

Adversaries target sources of American strength,

including our democratic system and our econ

omy. They steal and exploit our intellectual prop
erty and personal data, interfere in our political

processes, target our aviation and maritime sec
tors, and hold our critical infrastructure at risk.

All of these actions threaten the foundations of

the American way of life. Reestablishing lawful

control of our borders is a first step toward pro
tecting the American homeland and strengthen
ing American sovereignty.

We must prevent nuclear, chemical, radiological,

and biological at acks, block terrorists from reach
ing our homeland, reduce drug and human traf
ficking, and protect our critical infrastructure.

We must also deter, disrupt, and defeat poten
tial threats before they reach the United States.

We will target jihadist terrorists and transna
tional criminal organizations at their source and

dismantle their networks of support.

We must also take steps to respond quickly to meet

the needs of the American people in the event of

natural disaster or attack on our homeland. We

must build a culture of preparedness and resilience

across our governmental functions, critical infra
structure, and economic and political systems.

_Combat Biothreats and Pandemics_

Biological incidents have the potential to cause

catastrophic loss of life. Biological threats to the

U.S. homeland—whether as the result of deliberate

at ack, accident, or a natural outbreak—are growing

and require actions to address them at their source.

Naturally emerging outbreaks of viruses such as

Ebola and SARS, as well as the deliberate 2001

anthrax attacks in the United States, demon
strated the impact of biological threats on national

security by taking lives, generating economic

losses, and contributing to a loss of confidence in

government institutions.

Advancements in life sciences that benefit our

health, economy, and societ also open up new ave
nues to actors who want to cause harm. Dedicated

state actors are likely to develop more advanced

bioweapons, and these capabilities may become

available to malicious non-state actors as well.

_Priorit Actions_

**DETECT AND CONTAIN BIOTHREATS AT THEIR SOURCE:**

We will work with other countries to detect

and mitigate outbreaks early to prevent the

spread of disease. We will encourage other coun
tries to invest in basic health care systems and

to strengthen global health security across the

intersection of human and animal health to pre
vent infectious disease outbreaks. And we will

work with partners to ensure that laboratories

that handle dangerous pathogens have in place

safety and security measures.

**SUPPORT BIOMEDICAL INNOVATION: We will protect**

and support advancements in biomedical inno
vation by strengthening the intellectual prop
erty system that is the foundation of the biomedi
cal industry.

**IMPROVE EMERGENCY RESPONSE: At home, we will**

strengthen our emergency response and uni

fied coordination systems to rapidly characterize outbreaks, implement public health containment measures to limit the spread of disease,
and provide surge medical care—including
life-saving treatments.

_Strengthen Border Control_
_and Immigration Policy_

Strengthening control over our borders and
immigration system is central to national security, economic prosperity, and the rule of law.
Terrorists, drug traffickers, and criminal cartels exploit porous borders and threaten U.S.
security and public safety. These actors adapt
quickly to outpace our defenses.

The United States affirms our sovereign right to
determine who should enter our country and
under what circumstances. The United States
understands the contributions immigrants have
made to our Nation throughout its history. Illegal
immigration, however, burdens the economy,
hurts American workers, presents public safety
risks, and enriches smugglers and other criminals.

T e United States recognizes that decisions about
who to legally admit for residency, citizenship, or
otherwise are among the most important a country has to make. The United States will continue
to welcome lawful immigrants who do not pose
a security threat and whose entry is consistent
with the national interest, while at the same time
enhancing the screening and vetting of travelers,
closing dangerous loopholes, revising outdated
laws, and eliminating easily exploited vulnerabilities. We will also reform our current immigration system, which, contrary to our national
interest and national securit, allows for randomized entry and extended-family chain migration.
Residency and citizenship determinations should
be based on individuals’ merits and their ability
to positively contribute to U.S. societ, rather than
chance or extended family connections.

Pursue T reats
to T eir Source

There is no perfect defense against the range of
threats facing our homeland. That is why America
must, alongside allies and partners, stay on the
offensive against those violent non-state groups
that target the United States and our allies.

T e primary transnational threats Americans face
are from jihadist terrorists and transnational criminal organizations. Although their objectives dif er,
these actors pose some common challenges. First,
they exploit our open society. Second, they often
operate in loose confederations and adapt rapidly.
T ird, they rely on encrypted communication and
the dark web to evade detection as they plot, recruit,
fi nance, and execute their operations. Fourth, they
thrive under conditions of state weakness and prey
on the vulnerable as they accelerate the breakdown of rules to create havens from which to plan
and launch at acks on the United States, our allies,
and our partners. Fifth, some are sheltered and
supported by states and do their bidding.

_Defeat Jihadist Terrorists_

Jihadist terrorist organizations present the most
dangerous terrorist threat to the Nation. America,
alongside our allies and partners, is fi ghting a long
war against these fanatics who advance a totalitarian vision for a global Islamist caliphate that
justifies murder and slavery, promotes repression, and seeks to undermine the American way
of life. Jihadist terrorists use virtual and physical
networks around the world to radicalize isolated
individuals, exploit vulnerable populations, and
inspire and direct plots.

Even after the territorial defeat of ISIS and al-Qa’ida
in Syria and Iraq, the threat from jihadist terrorists will persist. T ey have used bat lefi elds as test
beds of terror and have exported tools and tactics
to their followers. Many of these jihadist terror

_Priorit Actions_

**ENHANCE BORDER SECURITY: We will secure our**
borders through the construction of a border wall, the use of multilayered defenses and
advanced technology, the employment of additional personnel, and other measures. The U.S.
Government will work with foreign partners to
deter, detect, and disrupt suspicious individuals
well before they enter the United States.

**ENHANCE VETTING:** The U.S. Government will
enhance vetting of prospective immigrants, refugees, and other foreign visitors to identify individuals who might pose a risk to national security or public safety. We will set higher security
standards to ensure that we keep dangerous people out of the United States and enhance our
information collection and analysis to identify
those who may already be within our borders.

**ENFORCE IMMIGRATION LAWS: We will enforce**
immigration laws, both at the border and in the
interior, to provide an ef ective deterrent to illegal
immigration. T e apprehension and swift removal
of illegal aliens at the border is critical to an ef ective
border security strategy. We must also increase
efforts to identify and counter fraud in the immigration process, which undermines the integrity
of our immigration system, exploits vulnerable
individuals, and creates national security risks.

**BOLSTER TR ANSPORTATION SECURIT Y:** We will
improve information sharing across our government and with foreign partners to enhance
the security of the pathways through which people and goods enter the country. We will invest in
technology to counter emerging threats to our aviation, surface, and maritime transportation sectors. We will also work with international and
industry partners to raise security standards.

ple. The government must do a better job of pro
tecting data to safeguard information and the

privacy of the American people. Our Federal net
works must be modernized and updated.

In addition, the daily lives of most Americans rely

on computer-driven and interconnected technolo
gies. As our reliance on computers and connectiv
ity increases, we become increasingly vulnerable

to cyberattacks. Businesses and individuals must

be able to operate securely in cyberspace.

Security was not a major consideration when the

Internet was designed and launched. As it evolves,

the government and private sector must design

systems that incorporate prevention, protec
tion, and resiliency from the start, not as an after
thought. We must do so in a way that respects free

markets, private competition, and the limited but

important role of government in enforcing the

rule of law. As we build the next generation of dig
ital infrastructure, we have an opportunit to put

our experience into practice.

The Internet is an American invention, and it

should reflect our values as it continues to trans
form the future for all nations and all genera
tions. A strong, defensible cyber infrastructure

fosters economic growth, protects our liberties,

and advances our national security.

_Priorit Actions_

**IDENTIFY AND PRIORITIZE RISK: To improve the secu-**

rity and resilience of our critical infrastruc
ture, we will assess risk across six key areas:

national securit, energy and power, banking and

finance, health and safety, communications, and

transportation. We will assess where cyberat
tacks could have catastrophic or cascading con
sequences and prioritize our protective efforts,

capabilities, and defenses accordingly.


**BUILD DEFENSIBLE GOVERNMENT NETWORKS: We will**

use the latest commercial capabilities, shared ser
vices, and best practices to modernize our Federal

information technology. We will improve our abil
it to provide uninterrupted and secure communi
cations and services under all conditions.

**DETER AND DISRUPT MALICIOUS CYBER ACTORS:**

The Federal Government will ensure that those

charged with securing critical infrastructure have

the necessary authorities, information, and capa
bilities to prevent attacks before they affect or

hold at risk U.S. critical infrastructure. T e United

States will impose swift and costly consequences

on foreign governments, criminals, and other

actors who undertake signifi cant malicious cyber

activities. We will work with allies and friends to

expand our awareness of malicious activities. A

stronger and more resilient critical infrastructure

will strengthen deterrence by creating doubt in our

adversaries that they can achieve their objectives.

**IMPROVE INFORMATION SHARING AND SENSING:**

The U.S. Government will work with our critical

infrastructure partners to assess their informa
tional needs and to reduce the barriers to informa
tion sharing, such as speed and classification lev
els. We will also invest in capabilities that improve

the ability of the United States to attribute cyber

liberties and privacy, the U.S. Government will

expand collaboration with the private sector so that

we can bet er detect and at ribute at acks.

**DEPLOY LAYERED DEFENSES: Since threats transit**

Promote American
Resilience

Despite our best efforts, our government cannot
prevent all dangers to the American people. We
can, however, help Americans remain resilient in
the face of adversity. Resilience includes the ability to withstand and recover rapidly from deliberate attacks, accidents, natural disasters, as well
as unconventional stresses, shocks, and threats
to our economy and democratic system. In the
event of a disaster, Federal, state, and local agencies must perform essential functions and have
plans in place to ensure the continuation of our
constitutional form of government.

Reducing risk and building more resilient communities are the best ways to protect people, property, and taxpayer dollars from loss and disruption. Through risk-informed investments, we will
build resilient communities and infrastructure
to protect and benefi t future generations.

Should tragedy strike, the U.S. Government will
help communities recover and rebuild. Citizens
must be confi dent in our government, but also recognize that response and recovery begins with
individuals and local communities. In difficult
times, the true character of the American people emerges: their strength, their love, and their
resolve. Our fi rst responders selfl essly run toward
danger, and volunteers rally to the aid of neighbors when disaster strikes.

A democracy is only as resilient as its people. An
informed and engaged citizenry is the fundamental requirement for a free and resilient nation. For
generations, our society has protected free press,
free speech, and free thought. Today, actors such
as Russia are using information tools in an at empt
to undermine the legitimacy of democracies.
Adversaries target media, political processes, fi nancial networks, and personal data. The American
public and private sectors must recognize this and


work together to defend our way of life. No external threat can be allowed to shake our shared
commitment to our values, undermine our system of government, or divide our Nation.

_Priorit Actions_

**IMPROVE RISK MANAGEMENT: The United States will**
improve its ability to assess the threats and hazards that pose the greatest risks to Americans
and will prioritize resources based on the highest risks.

**BUILD A CULTURE OF PREPAREDNESS: This Admin-**
istration will take steps to build a culture of preparedness, informing and empowering communities and individuals to obtain the skills and
take the preparatory actions necessary to become
more resilient against the threats and hazards
that Americans face.

**IMPROVE PLANNING: State and local governments**
must conduct realistic exercises that test existing plans to make sure that they are sound and
can be executed. Agencies from all levels of government must coordinate bet er and apply lessons
learned from exercises to pinpoint the areas and
capabilities that require improvement.

**INCENTIVIZE INFORMATION SHARING: To improve the**
coordination among the private sector and all levels of government that is needed to improve resilience, we must make a stronger commitment to
protecting sensitive information so that all partners actively identify and share vulnerabilities
and work collaboratively to reduce them.

States to maintain the world’s most powerful mili

We must rebuild our economic strength and

restore confidence in the American economic

model. Over decades, American factories, com

global fi nancial crisis, doubt replaced confi dence.

Risk-aversion and regulations replaced investment

T e U.S. trade defi cit grew as a result of several fac
tors, including unfair trading practices.

For 70 years, the United States has embraced a

strategy premised on the belief that leadership

of a stable international economic system rooted

in American principles of reciprocity, free mar
kets, and free trade served our economic and

security interests. Working with our allies and

partners, the United States led the creation of

a group of financial institutions and other eco
nomic forums that established equitable rules

and built instruments to stabilize the interna

tional economy and remove the points of friction
that had contributed to two world wars.

That economic system continues to serve our
interests, but it must be reformed to help American
workers prosper, protect our innovation,
and reflect the principles upon which that system was founded. Trading partners and international institutions can do more to address
trade imbalances and adhere to and enforce the
rules of the order.

Today, American prosperity and security are
challenged by an economic competition playing out in a broader strategic context. The United
States helped expand the liberal economic trading system to countries that did not share our values, in the hopes that these states would liberalize their economic and political practices and
provide commensurate benefits to the United
States. Experience shows that these countries distorted and undermined key economic institutions without undertaking significant reform of
their economies or politics. T ey espouse free trade
rhetoric and exploit its benefits, but only adhere
selectively to the rules and agreements.

To maintain our competitive advantage, the
United States will prioritize emerging technologies critical to economic growth and securit, such
as data science, encryption, autonomous technologies, gene editing, new materials, nanotechnology, advanced computing technologies, and
artificial intelligence. From self-driving cars to
autonomous weapons, the fi eld of artifi cial intelligence, in particular, is progressing rapidly.

T e United States must continue to at ract the innovative and the inventive, the brilliant and the bold.
We will encourage scientists in government, academia, and the private sector to achieve advancements across the full spectrum of discovery, from
incremental improvements to game-changing
breakthroughs. We will nurture a healthy innovation economy that collaborates with allies and

_Priorit Actions_

**ADOPT NEW TRADE AND INVESTMENT AGREEMENTS**

**AND MODERNIZE EXISTING ONES: The United States**
will pursue bilateral trade and investment agreements with countries that commit to fair and reciprocal trade and will modernize existing agreements to ensure they are consistent with those
principles. Agreements must adhere to high standards in intellectual property, digital trade, agriculture, labor, and the environment.

**COUNTER UNFAIR TRADE PRACTICES: The United**
States will counter all unfair trade practices that
distort markets using all appropriate means,
from dialogue to enforcement tools.

**COUNTER FOREIGN CORRUPTION: Using our eco-**

from an archaic R&D process to an approach that
rewards rapid fielding and risk taking.

Promote and Protect
the U.S. National Securit
Innovation Base

America’s business climate and legal and regulatory systems encourage risk taking. We are a
nation of people who work hard, dream big, and
never give up. Not every country shares these
characteristics. Some instead steal or illicitly
acquire America’s hard-earned intellectual property and proprietary information to compensate
for their own systemic weaknesses.

Every year, competitors such as China steal U.S.
intellectual property valued at hundreds of billions of dollars. Stealing proprietary technology and early-stage ideas allows competitors to
unfairly tap into the innovation of free societies. Over the years, rivals have used sophisticated


means to weaken our businesses and our economy as facets of cyber-enabled economic warfare and other malicious activities. In addition to
these illegal means, some actors use largely legitimate, legal transfers and relationships to gain
access to fields, experts, and trusted foundries
that fill their capability gaps and erode America’s
long-term competitive advantages.

We must defend our National Securit Innovation
Base (NSIB) against competitors. The NSIB is
the American network of knowledge, capabilities, and people—including academia, National
Laboratories, and the private sector—that turns
ideas into innovations, transforms discoveries
into successful commercial products and companies, and protects and enhances the American
way of life. T e genius of creative Americans, and
the free system that enables them, is critical to
American security and prosperity.

Protecting the NSIB requires a domestic and international response beyond the scope of any individual company, industry, university, or government agency. The landscape of innovation does
not divide neatly into sectors. Technologies that
are part of most weapon systems often originate
in diverse businesses as well as in universities and
colleges. Losing our innovation and technological edge would have far-reaching negative implications for American prosperit and power.

_Priorit Actions_

**UNDERSTAND THE CHALLENGES: T e U.S. Government**
will develop a capabilit to integrate, monitor, and

As a growing supplier of energy resources, technologies, and services around the world, the United
States will help our allies and partners become
more resilient against those that use energy to

also require an assessment of our vulnerabilities
and a resilient American infrastructure.

Finally, the Nation’s long-term energy security
future rests with our people. We must invest in our
future by supporting innovation and R&D, including through the National Laboratories.

_Priorit Actions_

**REDUCE BARRIERS: T e United States will promote**
clean and safe development of our energy resources,
while limiting regulatory burdens that encumber energy production and constrain economic
growth. We will streamline the Federal regulatory approval processes for energy infrastructure,
from pipeline and export terminals to container
shipments and gathering lines, while also ensuring
responsible environmental stewardship.

**PROMOTE EXPORTS: The United States will pro-**
mote exports of our energy resources, technologies, and services, which helps our allies and partners diversify their energy sources and brings
economic gains back home. We will expand our
export capacit through the continued support of
private sector development of coastal terminals,
allowing increased market access and a greater
competitive edge for U.S. industries.


**ENSURE ENERGY SECURITY: The United States will**
work with allies and partners to protect global
energy infrastructure from cyber and physical
threats. The United States will support the diversification of energy sources, supplies, and routes
at home and abroad. We will modernize our strategic petroleum stocks and encourage other
countries to develop their own—consistent with
their national energy security needs.

**ATTAIN UNIVERSAL ENERGY ACCESS: The United**
States will seek to ensure universal access to
affordable, reliable energy, including highly efficient fossil fuels, nuclear, and renewables, to
help reduce poverty, foster economic growth,
and promote prosperity.

**FURTHER AMERICA’S TECHNOLOGICAL EDGE: We will**
improve America’s technological edge in energy,
including nuclear technology, next-generation
nuclear reactors, better batteries, advanced computing, carbon-capture technologies, and opportunities at the energy-water nexus. T e United States

magnitude, these rivals compete across politi
cal, economic, and military arenas, and use tech
nology and information to accelerate these con
tests in order to shift regional balances of power

in their favor. These are fundamentally political

contests between those who favor repressive sys
tems and those who favor free societies.

China and Russia want to shape a world antithetical

to U.S. values and interests. China seeks to displace

the United States in the Indo-Pacifi c region, expand

the reaches of its state-driven economic model,

and reorder the region in its favor. Russia seeks to

restore its great power status and establish spheres

of influence near its borders. The intentions of

both nations are not necessarily fi xed. T e United


States stands ready to cooperate across areas of
mutual interest with both countries.

For decades, U.S. policy was rooted in the belief
that support for China’s rise and for its integration into the post-war international order would
liberalize China. Contrary to our hopes, China
expanded its power at the expense of the sovereignty of others. China gathers and exploits
data on an unrivaled scale and spreads features
of its authoritarian system, including corruption and the use of surveillance. It is building the
most capable and well-funded military in the
world, after our own. Its nuclear arsenal is growing and diversif ing. Part of China’s military modernization and economic expansion is due to its
access to the U.S. innovation economy, including America’s world-class universities.

Russia aims to weaken U.S. infl uence in the world
and divide us from our allies and partners. Russia
views the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO) and European Union (EU) as threats. Russia
is investing in new military capabilities, including nuclear systems that remain the most significant existential threat to the United States, and in

ized forms of subversive tactics, Russia interferes

in the domestic political af airs of countries around

the world. The combination of Russian ambition

and growing military capabilities creates an unsta
ble frontier in Eurasia, where the risk of conflict

due to Russian miscalculation is growing.

T e scourge of the world today is a small group of

rogue regimes that violate all principles of free

and civilized states. The Iranian regime spon
sors terrorism around the world. It is developing

more capable ballistic missiles and has the poten
tial to resume its work on nuclear weapons that

could threaten the United States and our part
ners. North Korea is ruled as a ruthless dictator
ship without regard for human dignity. For more

than 25 years, it has pursued nuclear weapons

and ballistic missiles in defi ance of every commit
ment it has made. Today, these missiles and weap
ons threaten the United States and our allies. T e

longer we ignore threats from countries deter
mined to proliferate and develop weapons of mass

destruction, the worse such threats become, and

the fewer defensive options we have.

The United States continues to wage a long war

against jihadist terrorist groups such as ISIS and

al-Qa’ida. These groups are linked by a common

radical Islamist ideology that encourages vio
lence against the United States and our partners

and produces misery for those under their control.

Although the United States and our partners have

infl icted defeats on ISIS and al-Qa’ida in Syria and

Iraq, these organizations maintain global reach

with established branches in strategic locations.

The threat from jihadist terrorists will persist,

even as we intensify efforts to prevent attacks on

Americans, our allies, and our partners.

Protecting American interests requires that we

compete continuously within and across these

contests, which are being played out in regions

around the world. The outcome of these con

tests will influence the political, economic, and

military strength of the United States and our

allies and partners.

To prevail, we must integrate all elements of

America’s national power—political, economic, and

military. Our allies and partners must also con
tribute the capabilities, and demonstrate the will,

to confront shared threats. Experience suggests

that the willingness of rivals to abandon or forgo

aggression depends on their perception of U.S.

strength and the vitalit of our alliances.

The United States will seek areas of cooperation

with competitors from a position of strength, fore
most by ensuring our military power is second

to none and fully integrated with our allies and

all of our instruments of power. A strong mili
tary ensures that our diplomats are able to oper
ate from a position of strength. In this way we can,

together with our allies and partners, deter and if

necessary, defeat aggression against U.S. interests

and increase the likelihood of managing competi
tions without violent confl ict and preserving peace.

Renew America’s
Competitive Advantages

The United States must consider what is endur
ing about the problems we face, and what is new.

The contests over influence are timeless. They

have existed in varying degrees and levels of inten
sity, for millennia. Geopolitics is the interplay of

these contests across the globe. But some condi
tions are new, and have changed how these com
petitions are unfolding. We face simultaneous

threats from different actors across multiple are
nas—all accelerated by technology. The United

States must develop new concepts and capabili
ties to protect our homeland, advance our pros
perit, and preserve peace.

Renew Capabilities

Given the new features of the geopolitical environment, the United States must renew key capabilities to address the challenges we face.

_Military_

U.S. military strength remains a vital component of the competition for influence. The Joint
Force demonstrates U.S. resolve and commitment and provides us with the ability to fight
and win across any plausible conflict that threatens U.S. vital interests.

The United States must retain overmatch—
the combination of capabilities in sufficient
scale to prevent enemy success and to ensure
that America’s sons and daughters will never
be in a fair fight. Overmatch strengthens our
diplomacy and permits us to shape the international environment to protect our interests.
To retain military overmatch the United States
must restore our ability to produce innovative
capabilities, restore the readiness of our forces for
major war, and grow the size of the force so that it
is capable of operating at sufficient scale and for
ample duration to win across a range of scenarios.

We must convince adversaries that we can and
will defeat them—not just punish them if they
at ack the United States. We must ensure the ability to deter potential enemies by denial, convincing them that they cannot accomplish objectives
through the use of force or other forms of aggression. We need our allies to do the same—to modernize, acquire necessary capabilities, improve readiness, expand the size of their forces, and affirm
the political will to win.


means to achieve their goals. They are unencumbered by truth, by the rules and protections of privacy inherent in democracies, and by the law of
armed conflict. They employ sophisticated political, economic, and military campaigns that combine discrete actions. They are patient and content to accrue strategic gains over time—making
it harder for the United States and our allies to
respond. Such actions are calculated to achieve
maximum effect without provoking a direct military response from the United States. And as
these incremental gains are realized, over time,
a new status quo emerges.

T e United States must prepare for this t pe of competition. China, Russia, and other state and nonstate actors recognize that the United States often
views the world in binary terms, with states being
either “at peace” or “at war,” when it is actually an
arena of continuous competition. Our adversaries will not fi ght us on our terms. We will raise our
competitive game to meet that challenge, to protect American interests, and to advance our values.

Our diplomatic, intelligence, military, and economic agencies have not kept pace with the changes
in the character of competition. America’s military must be prepared to operate across a full spectrum of confl ict, across multiple domains at once.
To meet these challenges we must also upgrade
our political and economic instruments to operate
across these environments.

Bureaucratic inertia is powerful. But so is the talent, creativity, and dedication of Americans. By
aligning our public and private sector efforts we
can field a Joint Force that is unmatched. New
advances in computing, autonomy, and manufacturing are already transforming the way we fi ght.
When coupled with the strength of our allies and
partners, this advantage grows. The future that
we face is ours to win or lose. History suggests
that Americans will rise to the occasion and that
we can shift trends back in favor of the United
States, our allies, and our partners.

high-technology skills for cybersecurit and aerospace. Support for a vibrant domestic manufacturing sector, a solid defense industrial base, and resilient supply chains is a national priority.

_Priorit Actions_

**UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM: We will evaluate the**
strengths and weaknesses of our defense industrial base, including the identification of materials essential to national security, contingencies
that could affect supply chains, and technologies
that are likely to be critical for the future.

**ENCOURAGE HOMELAND INVESTMENT: The United**
States will promote policies and incentives
that return key national security industries
to American shores. Where possible, the U.S.
Government will work with industry partners to
strengthen U.S. competitiveness in key technologies and manufacturing capabilities. In addition,
we will reform regulations and processes to facilitate the export of U.S. military equipment.

**PROTECT AND GROW CRITICAL SKILLS: The United**
States must maintain and develop skilled trades
and high-technology skills through increased
support for technical college and apprenticeship programs. We will support STEM efforts,
at the Federal and state levels, and target national
security technology areas.

_Nuclear Forces_

Nuclear weapons have served a vital purpose in
America’s National Security Strategy for the past
70 years. They are the foundation of our strategy to preserve peace and stability by deterring
aggression against the United States, our allies,
and our partners. While nuclear deterrence strategies cannot prevent all conflict, they are essen

tial to prevent nuclear at ack, non-nuclear strategic
attacks, and large-scale conventional aggression.
In addition, the extension of the U.S. nuclear deterrent to more than 30 allies and partners helps to
assure their security, and reduces their need to
possess their own nuclear capabilities.

Following the Cold War, the United States reduced
investments in our nuclear enterprise and reduced
the role of nuclear weapons in our strategy. Some
parts of America’s strategic nuclear Triad of bombers, sea-based missiles, and land-based missiles are
over 30 years old, and much of our nuclear infrastructure dates to the World War II era. At the same
time, however, nuclear-armed adversaries have
expanded their arsenals and range of delivery systems. The United States must maintain the credible deterrence and assurance capabilities provided
by our nuclear Triad and by U.S. theater nuclear
capabilities deployed abroad. Significant investment is needed to maintain a U.S. nuclear arsenal
and infrastructure that is able to meet national
securit threats over the coming decades.

_Priorit Actions_

**SUSTAIN U.S. NUCLEAR WEAPONS: The United States**
will sustain a nuclear force structure that meets
our current needs and addresses unanticipated
risks. The United States does not need to match
the nuclear arsenals of other powers, but we must
sustain a stockpile that can deter adversaries,
assure allies and partners, and achieve U.S. objectives if deterrence fails.

**MODE RNIZE U. S . N UCLE AR FORCES AND INFR A-**

**STRUCTURE: We will modernize our nuclear enter-**

-----

the highly skilled workforce needed to develop,
manufacture, and deploy nuclear weapons.

**MAINTAIN STABLE DETERRENCE: To avoid miscalcu-**
lation, the United States will conduct discussions
with other states to build predictable relationships and reduce nuclear risks. We will consider
new arms control arrangements if they contribute
to strategic stability and if they are verifiable. We
will not allow adversaries to use threats of nuclear
escalation or other irresponsible nuclear behaviors to coerce the United States, our allies, and
our partners. Fear of escalation will not prevent
the United States from defending our vital interests and those of our allies and partners.

_Space_

The United States must maintain our leadership
and freedom of action in space. Communications
and fi nancial networks, military and intelligence
systems, weather monitoring, navigation, and
more have components in the space domain. As
U.S. dependence on space has increased, other
actors have gained access to space-based systems
and information. Governments and private sector
fi rms have the abilit to launch satellites into space
at increasingly lower costs. T e fusion of data from
imagery, communications, and geolocation services allows motivated actors to access previously
unavailable information. T is “democratization of
space” has an impact on military operations and
on America’s abilit to prevail in confl ict.

Many countries are purchasing satellites to support their own strategic military activities. Others
believe that the abilit to at ack space assets of ers
an asymmetric advantage and as a result, are pursuing a range of anti-satellite (ASAT) weapons.
The United States considers unfettered access to
and freedom to operate in space to be a vital interest. Any harmful interference with or an attack
upon critical components of our space architecture that directly affects this vital U.S. inter

est will be met with a deliberate response at a

time, place, manner, and domain of our choosing.

_Priorit Actions_

**ADVANCE SPACE AS A PRIORITY DOMAIN: America’s**

newly re-established National Space Council,

chaired by the Vice President, will review America’s

long-range space goals and develop a strategy that

integrates all space sectors to support innova
tion and American leadership in space.

**PROMOTE SPACE COMMERCE: The United States will**

simplify and update regulations for commer
cial space activity to strengthen competitiveness.

As the U.S. Government partners with U.S. com
mercial space capabilities to improve the resil

**MAINTAIN LEAD IN EXPLORATION: To enable human**

exploration across the solar system and to bring

back to Earth new knowledge and opportuni
ties, we will increase public-private partnerships

and promote ventures beyond low Earth orbit

with allies and friends.

_Cyberspace_

Malicious state and non-state actors use cyberat
tacks for extortion, information warfare, disinfor
mation, and more. Such at acks have the capabilit

to harm large numbers of people and institutions

with comparatively minimal investment and a

troubling degree of deniability. These attacks can

undermine faith and confidence in democratic

institutions and the global economic system.

as tools for projecting influence, and some use

cyber tools to protect and extend their autocratic

actors who use cyberspace capabilities against the

to take action against malicious actors in cyberspace, the United States will be risk informed, but
not risk averse, in considering our options.

_Priorit Actions_

**IM PROVE AT TRIB UTION, ACCOU NTAB ILIT Y, AN D**

**RESPONSE: We will invest in capabilities to sup-**
port and improve our ability to attribute cyberattacks, to allow for rapid response.

**ENHANCE CYBER TOOLS AND EXPERTISE: We will**
improve our cyber tools across the spectrum of
conflict to protect U.S. Government assets and
U.S. critical infrastructure, and to protect the
integrity of data and information. U.S. departments and agencies will recruit, train, and
retain a workforce capable of operating across
this spectrum of activity.

**I M PROVE I NTEG R ATIO N AN D AG I LIT Y:** We will
improve the integration of authorities and procedures across the U.S. Government so that
cyber operations against adversaries can be
conducted as required. We will work with the
Congress to address the challenges that continue
to hinder timely intelligence and information
sharing, planning and operations, and the development of necessary cyber tools.

_Intelligence_

America’s ability to identify and respond to geostrategic and regional shifts and their political, economic, military, and securit implications requires
that the U.S. Intelligence Community (IC) gather,
analyze, discern, and operationalize information.
In this information-dominant era, the IC must continuously pursue strategic intelligence to anticipate geostrategic shifts, as well as shorter-term
intelligence so that the United States can respond
to the actions and provocations of rivals.


The ability of the United States to modernize
our military forces to overmatch our adversaries requires intelligence support. Intelligence is
needed to understand and anticipate foreign doctrine and the intent of foreign leaders, prevent tactical and operational surprise, and ensure that
U.S. capabilities are not compromised before
they are fielded. In addition, virtually all modern weapon systems depend upon data derived
from scientifi c and technical intelligence.

T e IC, as well as the law enforcement communit,
offer unique abilities to defend against and mitigate threat actors operating below the threshold of
open conflict. Both communities have exceptionally strong liaison relationships throughout the
world, allowing the United States to cooperate with
allies and partners to protect against adversaries.

_Priorit Actions_

**IMPROVE UNDERSTANDING: To prevent the theft of**
sensitive and proprietary information and maintain supply chain integrit, the United States must
increase our understanding of the economic policy priorities of our adversaries and improve
our ability to detect and defeat their attempts to
commit economic espionage.

**HARNESS ALL INFORMATION AT OUR DISPOSAL: The**
United States will, in concert with allies and partners, use the information-rich open-source environment to deny the ability of state and non-state
actors to attack our citizens, conduct offensive
intelligence activities, and degrade America’s
democratic institutions.

**FUSE INFORMATION AND ANALYSIS: T e United States**
will fuse our analysis of information derived from
the diplomatic, information, military, and economic domains to compete more effectively on
the geopolitical stage.

-----

**ACTIVATE LOCAL NETWORKS: Local voices are most**
compelling and effective in ideological competitions. We must amplify credible voices and partner with them to advance alternatives to violent
and hateful messages. Since media and Internet
companies are the platforms through which messages are transported, the private sector should
lend its creativity and resources to promoting the values that inspire and grow a community of civilized groups and individuals.

**SHARE RESPONSIBILITY: The United States will**
urge states where radicalism thrives to take
greater responsibility for countering violent
messaging and promoting tolerant and pluralistic worldviews.

**U P G R A D E, TA I L O R, A N D I N N OVAT E :** We will
reexamine legacy delivery platforms for communicating U.S. messages overseas. We must
consider more cost-effective and efficient ways
to deliver and evaluate content consistent with
U.S. national security interests.


China, for example, combines data and the use of AI
to rate the loyalt of its citizens to the state and uses
these ratings to determine jobs and more. Jihadist
terrorist groups continue to wage ideological information campaigns to establish and legitimize their
narrative of hate, using sophisticated communications tools to at ract recruits and encourage at acks
against Americans and our partners.

Russia uses information operations as part of its
offensive cyber efforts to influence public opinion across the globe. Its infl uence campaigns blend
covert intelligence operations and false online personas with state-funded media, third-party intermediaries, and paid social media users or “trolls.”

U.S. ef orts to counter the exploitation of information by rivals have been tepid and fragmented. U.S.
ef orts have lacked a sustained focus and have been
hampered by the lack of properly trained professionals. The American private sector has a direct
interest in supporting and amplifying voices
that stand for tolerance, openness, and freedom.

_Priorit Actions_

**PRIORITIZE THE COMPETITION: We will improve**
our understanding of how adversaries gain informational and psychological advantages across
all policies. The United States must empower
a true public diplomacy capability to compete
ef ectively in this arena.

**DRIVE EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATIONS: We will craft**
and direct coherent communications campaigns
to advance American infl uence and counter challenges from the ideological threats that emanate from radical Islamist groups and competitor
nations. T ese campaigns will adhere to American
values and expose adversary propaganda and
disinformation.

ur America First foreign policy celebrates America’s influence in the
world as a positive force that can help

# Oset the conditions for peace and prosperity and

for developing successful societies.

T ere is no arc of history that ensures that America’s
free political and economic system will automatically prevail. Success or failure depends upon our
actions. This Administration has the confidence
to compete to protect our values and interests and
the fundamental principles that underpin them.

During the Cold War, a totalitarian threat from
the Soviet Union motivated the free world to create coalitions in defense of liberty. Today’s challenges to free societies are just as serious, but
more diverse. State and non-state actors project influence and advance their objectives by
exploiting information, democratic media freedoms, and international institutions. Repressive
leaders often collaborate to subvert free societies
and corrupt multilateral organizations.

Around the world, nations and individuals admire
what America stands for. We treat people equally
and value and uphold the rule of law. We have
a democratic system that allows the best ideas
to flourish. We know how to grow economies so
that individuals can achieve prosperity. These


qualities have made America the richest coun
try on earth—rich in culture, talent, opportuni
ties, and material wealth.

T e United States of ers partnership to those who

share our aspirations for freedom and prosperity.

We lead by example. “The world has its eye upon

America," Alexander Hamilton once observed. “T e

noble struggle we have made in the cause of libert,

has occasioned a kind of revolution in human sen
timent. The influence of our example has pene
trated the gloomy regions of despotism.”

We are not going to impose our values on oth
ers. Our alliances, partnerships, and coalitions

are built on free will and shared interests. When

the United States partners with other states, we

develop policies that enable us to achieve our

goals while our partners achieve theirs.

Allies and partners are a great strength of the

United States. They add directly to U.S. politi
cal, economic, military, intelligence, and other

capabilities. Together, the United States and our

allies and partners represent well over half of

the global GDP. None of our adversaries have

comparable coalitions.

We encourage those who want to join our com

sector activity, and rule of law. The United States
will shift away from a reliance on assistance based
on grants to approaches that at ract private capital
and catalyze private sector activit . We will emphasize reforms that unlock the economic potential of
citizens, such as the promotion of formal propert
rights, entrepreneurial reforms, and infrastructure improvements—projects that help people earn
their livelihood and have the added benefi t of helping U.S. businesses. By mobilizing both public and
private resources, the United States can help maximize returns and outcomes and reduce the burden
on U.S. Government resources. Unlike the state-directed mercantilism of some competitors that
can disadvantage recipient nations and promote
dependency, the purpose of U.S. foreign assistance
should be to end the need for it. T e United States
seeks strong partners, not weak ones.

U.S. development assistance must support
America’s national interests. We will prioritize collaboration with aspiring partners that are aligned
with U.S. interests. We will focus on development
investments where we can have the most impact—
where local reformers are committed to tackling
their economic and political challenges.

Within this framework, the United States will
also assist fragile states to prevent threats to the
U.S. homeland. Transnational threat organizations, such as jihadist terrorists and organized
crime, often operate freely from fragile states
and undermine sovereign governments. Failing
states can destabilize entire regions.

Across Africa, Latin America, and Asia, states are
eager for investments and financing to develop
their infrastructure and propel growth. The
United States and its partners have opportunities to work with countries to help them realize their potential as prosperous and sovereign
states that are accountable to their people. Such
states can become trading partners that buy more
American-made goods and create more predictable business environments that benefi t American


companies. American-led investments represent
the most sustainable and responsible approach
to development and offer a stark contrast to
the corrupt, opaque, exploitive, and low-quality deals offered by authoritarian states.

_Priorit Actions:_
_Developing Countries_

**MOB ILIZE R E SOU RCE S:** The United States will
modernize its development finance tools so that
U.S. companies have incentives to capitalize on
opportunities in developing countries. With
these changes, the United States will not be left
behind as other states use investment and project finance to extend their influence. In addition, the U.S. Government must not be an obstacle to U.S. companies that want to conduct
business in the developing world.

**CAPITALIZE ON NEW TECHNOLOGIES: We will incor-**
porate innovative technologies in our diplomatic and development programs. For example, digital technologies enable millions to access
financial services through their cell phones and
can connect farmers to markets. Such technologies can reduce corruption, increase transparency, and help ensure that money reaches
its intended destination.

**INCENTIVIZE REFORMS: The United States will use**
diplomacy and assistance to encourage states to
make choices that improve governance, rule of
law, and sustainable development. We already
do this through the Millennium Challenge
Corporation, which selects countries that are
committed to reform and then monitors and
evaluates their projects.

_Priorit Actions: Fragile States_

**COMMIT SELECTIVELY: We will give priority to**
strengthening states where state weaknesses or
failure would magnify threats to the American

homeland. For instance, engagement in

Afghanistan seeks to prevent the reemergence of

terrorist safe havens.

**WORK WITH REFORMERS: Political problems are at**

the root of most state fragility. The United States

will prioritize programs that empower reform
minded governments, people, and civil societ . As

the United States designs its efforts, inputs from

local actors improve the likelihood of enduring

solutions, reduce costs, and increase accountabil
ity to the American taxpayer.

**SYNCHRONIZE ACTIONS: The United States must**

use its diplomatic, economic, and military tools

simultaneously when assisting aspiring part
ners. We will place a priority on economic

support that achieves local and macroeconomic

stability, helps build capable security forces, and

strengthens the rule of law.

Achieve Bet er Outcomes
in Multilateral Forums

The United States must lead and engage in the

multinational arrangements that shape many

of the rules that affect U.S. interests and values.

A competition for influence exists in these insti
tutions. As we participate in them, we must pro
tect American sovereignt and advance American

interests and values.

A range of international institutions establishes

the rules for how states, businesses, and individ
uals interact with each other, across land and sea,

the Arctic, outer space, and the digital realm. It is

vital to U.S. prosperit and securit that these insti
tutions uphold the rules that help keep these com
mon domains open and free. Free access to the seas

remains a central principle of national security

and economic prosperity, and exploration of sea

and space provides opportunities for commercial

gain and scientifi c breakthroughs. T e fl ow of data


and an open, interoperable Internet are inseparable from the success of the U.S. economy.

Authoritarian actors have long recognized the
power of multilateral bodies and have used them
to advance their interests and limit the freedom
of their own citizens. If the United States cedes
leadership of these bodies to adversaries, opportunities to shape developments that are positive for the United States will be lost. All institutions are not equal, however. The United States
will prioritize its efforts in those organizations
that serve American interests, to ensure that
they are strengthened and supportive of the
United States, our allies, and our partners. Where
existing institutions and rules need modernizing, the United States will lead to update them.
At the same time, it should be clear that the United
States will not cede sovereignt to those that claim
authority over American citizens and are in conflict with our constitutional framework.

_Priorit Actions_

**EXERCISE LEADERSHIP IN POLITICAL AND SECURITY**

**BODIES: T e United States will strive for outcomes**
in political and security forums that are consistent with U.S. interests and values—values which
are shared by our allies and partners. The United
Nations can help contribute to solving many of
the complex problems in the world, but it must be
reformed and recommit to its founding principles. We will require accountability and emphasize shared responsibility among members. If the
United States is asked to provide a disproportionate level of support for an institution, we will expect
a commensurate degree of influence over the
direction and efforts of that institution.

**SHAPE AND REFORM INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL AND**

_Priorit Actions_

**SUPPORT THE DIGNITY OF INDIVIDUALS: We support,**
with our words and actions, those who live under
oppressive regimes and who seek freedom, individual dignity, and the rule of law. We are under
no obligation to offer the benefits of our free and
prosperous communit to repressive regimes and
human rights abusers. We may use diplomacy,
sanctions, and other tools to isolate states and leaders who threaten our interests and whose actions
run contrary to our values. We will not remain
silent in the face of evil. We will hold perpetrators of genocide and mass atrocities accountable.

**DEFEAT TRANSNATIONAL TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS:**
There can be no greater action to advance the
rights of individuals than to defeat jihadist terrorists and other groups that foment hatred and use
violence to advance their supremacist Islamist ideologies. We will continue to join with other states to
defeat this scourge of all civilized peoples.

**E MPOWE R WOME N AND YOUTH : Societies that**
empower women to participate fully in civic and
economic life are more prosperous and peaceful. We will support efforts to advance women’s equality, protect the rights of women and
girls, and promote women and youth empowerment programs.


**PROTEC T R E LIG IOUS FR E E DOM AN D R E LIG IOUS**

**MINORITIES: We will advocate on behalf of religious**
freedom and threatened minorities. Religious
minorities continue to be victims of violence. We
will place a priority on protecting these groups
and will continue working with regional partners
to protect minority communities from attacks
and to preserve their cultural heritage.

**REDUCE HUMAN SUFFERING: T e United States will**
continue to lead the world in humanitarian assistance. Even as we expect others to share responsibility, the United States will continue to catalyze international responses to man-made and
natural disasters and provide our expertise and
capabilities to those in need. We will support
food security and health programs that save lives
and address the root cause of hunger and disease. We will support displaced people close to
their homes to help meet their needs until they
can safely and voluntarily return home.

##### The Strategy in a Regional Context

The United States must tailor our approaches to different regions of the
world to protect U.S. national interests. We require integrated regional strategies that appreciate the nature and magnitude of threats, the intensit of
competitions, and the promise of available opportunities, all in the context
of local political, economic, social, and historical realities.


hanges in a regional balance of power can
have global consequences and threaten
U.S. interests. Markets, raw materi
## Cals, lines of communication, and human capital

are located within, or move among, key regions
of the world. China and Russia aspire to project power worldwide, but they interact most with
their neighbors. North Korea and Iran also pose
the greatest menace to those closest to them. But,
as destructive weapons proliferate and regions
become more interconnected, threats become
more difficult to contain. And regional balances
that shift against the United States could combine
to threaten our security.

The United States must marshal the will and
capabilities to compete and prevent unfavorable
shifts in the Indo-Pacific, Europe, and the Middle
East. Sustaining favorable balances of power will
require a strong commitment and close cooperation with allies and partners because allies and
partners magnif U.S. power and extend U.S. infl uence. They share our interests and responsibility
for resisting authoritarian trends, contesting radical ideologies, and deterring aggression.

In other regions of the world, instabilit and weak
governance threaten U.S. interests. Some governments are unable to maintain security and
meet the basic needs of their people, making
their country and citizens vulnerable to preda

tors. Terrorists and criminals thrive where governments are weak, corruption is rampant, and
faith in government institutions is low. Strategic
competitors often exploit rather than discourage corruption and state weakness to extract
resources and exploit their populations.

Regions afflicted by instability and weak governments also offer opportunities to improve securit, promote prosperit, and restore hope. Aspiring
partner states across the developing world want
to improve their societies, build transparent and
ef ective governments, confront non-state threats,
and strengthen their sovereignty. Many recognize the opportunities offered by market economies and political liberties and are eager for partnership with the United States and our allies. T e
United States will encourage aspiring partners as
they undertake reforms and pursue their aspirations. States that prosper and nations that transition from recipients of development assistance
to trading partners offer economic opportunities
for American businesses. And stability reduces
threats that target Americans at home.

**ECONOMIC:** The United States will encourage

on both sides of the Atlantic. Today, Europe is one

of the most prosperous regions in the world and

Although the menace of Soviet communism is

gone, new threats test our will. Russia is using

subversive measures to weaken the credibil
ity of America’s commitment to Europe, under
mine transatlantic unity, and weaken European

institutions and governments. With its inva
sions of Georgia and Ukraine, Russia demon
strated its willingness to violate the sovereignty

of states in the region. Russia continues to intim
idate its neighbors with threatening behavior,

such as nuclear posturing and the forward deploy
ment of offensive capabilities.

China is gaining a strategic foothold in Europe by

expanding its unfair trade practices and invest
ing in key industries, sensitive technologies, and

infrastructure. Europe also faces immediate

threats from violent Islamist extremists. Attacks

by ISIS and other jihadist groups in Spain, France,

Germany, Belgium, the United Kingdom, and


47


-----

other countries show that our European partners
continue to face serious threats. Instability in the
Middle East and Africa has triggered the movement
of millions of migrants and refugees into Europe,
exacerbating instabilit and tensions in the region.

T e United States is safer when Europe is prosperous and stable, and can help defend our shared
interests and ideals. The United States remains
fi rmly commit ed to our European allies and partners. The NATO alliance of free and sovereign
states is one of our great advantages over our competitors, and the United States remains committed to Article V of the Washington Treat .

European allies and partners increase our strategic reach and provide access to forward basing and
overflight rights for global operations. Together
we confront shared threats. European nations
are contributing thousands of troops to help fi ght
jihadist terrorists in Afghanistan, stabilize Iraq,
and fight terrorist organizations across Africa
and the greater Middle East.

T e NATO alliance will become stronger when all
members assume greater responsibility for and
pay their fair share to protect our mutual interests,
sovereignty, and values.

_Priorit Actions_

**POLITICAL: T e United States will deepen collabora-**
tion with our European allies and partners to confront forces threatening to undermine our common values, securit interests, and shared vision.
The United States and Europe will work together
to counter Russian subversion and aggression,
and the threats posed by North Korea and Iran.
We will continue to advance our shared principles and interests in international forums.

**ECONOMIC: The United States will work with the**
European Union, and bilaterally with the United
Kingdom and other states, to ensure fair and reciprocal trade practices and eliminate barriers to


growth. We will encourage European foreign direct

investment in the United States to create jobs. We

will work with our allies and partners to diver

security of European countries. We will work

with our partners to contest China’s unfair trade

and economic practices and restrict its acquisi
tion of sensitive technologies.

**MILITARY AND SECURITY: The United States ful-**

fills our defense responsibilities and expects oth
ers to do the same. We expect our European allies

to increase defense spending to 2 percent of gross

domestic product by 2024, with 20 percent of this

spending devoted to increasing military capa
bilities. On NATO’s eastern flank we will con
tinue to strengthen deterrence and defense, and

catalyze frontline allies and partners’ efforts

to better defend themselves. We will work with

NATO to improve its integrated air and mis
sile defense capabilities to counter existing and

projected ballistic and cruise missile threats,

particularly from Iran. We will increase counter
terrorism and cybersecurit cooperation.

Middle East

The United States seeks a Middle East that is

not a safe haven or breeding ground for jihadist

terrorists, not dominated by any power hostile to

the United States, and that contributes to a stable

global energy market.

For years, the interconnected problems of Iranian

expansion, state collapse, jihadist ideology,

socio-economic stagnation, and regional rival
ries have convulsed the Middle East. The United

States has learned that neither aspirations for dem
ocratic transformation nor disengagement can

insulate us from the region’s problems. We must

be realistic about our expectations for the region

without allowing pessimism to obscure our inter
ests or vision for a modern Middle East.

**POLITICAL: We will deepen our strategic partner-**
ship with India and support its leadership role
in Indian Ocean security and throughout the
broader region. We will press Pakistan to intensify its counterterrorism efforts, since no partnership can survive a country’s support for militants and terrorists who target a partner’s own
service members and officials. The United States
will also encourage Pakistan to continue demonstrating that it is a responsible steward of its
nuclear assets. We will continue to partner with
Afghanistan to promote peace and securit in the
region. We will continue to promote anti-corruption reform in Afghanistan to increase the legitimacy of its government and reduce the appeal of
violent extremist organizations. We will help South
Asian nations maintain their sovereignt as China
increases its influence in the region.

**ECONOMIC: We will encourage the economic inte-**
gration of Central and South Asia to promote
prosperity and economic linkages that will bolster connectivity and trade. And we will encourage India to increase its economic assistance
in the region. In Pakistan, we will build trade
and investment ties as security improves and as
Pakistan demonstrates that it will assist the United
States in our counterterrorism goals.

**MILITARY AND SECURIT Y:** We are committed to
supporting the Afghan government and security
forces in their fi ght against the Taliban, al-Qa’ida,
ISIS, and other terrorists. We will bolster the
fighting strength of the Afghan security forces
to convince the Taliban that they cannot win on
the battlefield and to set the conditions for diplomatic efforts to achieve enduring peace. We will
insist that Pakistan take decisive action against
militant and terrorist groups operating from its
soil. We will work with the Central Asian states
to guarantee access to the region to support our
counterterrorism efforts.


balance of power. We will assist regional partners in strengthening their institutions and
capabilities, including in law enforcement, to
conduct counterterrorism and counterinsurgency efforts. We will help partners procure
interoperable missile defense and other capabilities to better defend against active missile
threats. We will work with partners to neutralize Iran’s malign activities in the region.

South and Central Asia

With over a quarter of the world’s population, a
fi fth of all U.S.-designated terrorist groups, several
fast-growing economies, and two nuclear-armed
states, South and Central Asia present some of the
most complicated national security challenges
and opportunities. The region spans the terrorist
threats emanating from the Middle East and the
competition for power unfolding in Europe and
the Indo-Pacific. The United States continues to
face threats from transnational terrorists and militants operating from within Pakistan. T e prospect
for an Indo-Pakistani military conflict that could
lead to a nuclear exchange remains a key concern
requiring consistent diplomatic at ention.

U.S. interests in the region include countering terrorist threats that impact the security of the U.S.
homeland and our allies, preventing cross-border
terrorism that raises the prospect of military and
nuclear tensions, and preventing nuclear weapons, technology, and materials from falling into
the hands of terrorists. We seek an American presence in the region proportionate to threats to the
homeland and our allies. We seek a Pakistan that is
not engaged in destabilizing behavior and a stable
and self-reliant Afghanistan. And we seek Central
Asian states that are resilient against domination
by rival powers, are resistant to becoming jihadist safe havens, and prioritize reforms.

Western Hemisphere

Stable, friendly, and prosperous states in the
Western Hemisphere enhance our security and
benefit our economy. Democratic states connected by shared values and economic interests
will reduce the violence, drug traf cking, and illegal immigration that threaten our common security, and will limit opportunities for adversaries to operate from areas of close proximity to us.

In the last half century, parts of this hemisphere
were marred by dictatorships and insurgencies
that killed tens of thousands of people. Today,
this region stands on the cusp of prosperity and
peace, built upon democracy and the rule of law.
U.S. trade in the region is thriving and market
opportunities for American goods and services,
energy and infrastructure projects, and foreign
direct investment continue to expand.

Challenges remain, however. Transnational criminal organizations—including gangs and cartels—
perpetuate violence and corruption, and threaten
the stability of Central American states including Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador. In
Venezuela and Cuba, governments cling to anachronistic leftist authoritarian models that continue to fail their people. Competitors have found
operating space in the hemisphere.

China seeks to pull the region into its orbit through
state-led investments and loans. Russia continues its failed politics of the Cold War by bolstering its radical Cuban allies as Cuba continues to
repress its citizens. Both China and Russia support the dictatorship in Venezuela and are seeking to expand military linkages and arms sales
across the region. The hemisphere’s democratic
states have a shared interest in confronting threats
to their sovereignty.

Canada and the United States share a unique
strategic and defense partnership. The United
States also has important and deepening rela

tions with key countries in the region. Together,
we will build a stable and peaceful hemisphere
that increases economic opportunities for all,
improves governance, reduces the power of criminal organizations, and limits the malign influence of non-hemispheric forces.

_Priorit Actions_

**POLITICAL: We will catalyze regional ef orts to build**
securit and prosperit through strong diplomatic
engagement. We will isolate governments that
refuse to act as responsible partners in advancing
hemispheric peace and prosperit . We look forward
to the day when the people of Cuba and Venezuela
can enjoy freedom and the benefi ts of shared prosperity, and we encourage other free states in the
hemisphere to support this shared endeavor.

**ECONOMIC: We will modernize our trade agree-**
ments and deepen our economic ties with the
region and ensure that trade is fair and reciprocal.
We will encourage further market-based economic
reforms and encourage transparency to create conditions for sustained prosperity. We will ensure
the U.S. fi nancial system does not serve as a haven
or transit point for criminal proceeds.

**MILITARY AND SECURITY: We will build upon local**
efforts and encourage cultures of lawfulness to
reduce crime and corruption, including by supporting local efforts to professionalize police and
other security forces; strengthen the rule of law
and undertake judicial reform; and improve information sharing to target criminals and corrupt
leaders and disrupt illicit trafficking.

Africa

Africa remains a continent of promise and enduring challenges. Africa contains many of the world’s
fastest growing economies, which represent potential new markets for U.S. goods and services.
Aspiring partners across the continent are eager
to build market-based economies and enhance stabilit . T e demand for qualit American exports is
high and will likely grow as Africa’s population and
prosperit increase. People across the continent are
demanding government accountability and less
corruption, and are opposing autocratic trends. T e
number of stable African nations has grown since
the independence era as numerous countries have
emerged from devastating confl icts and undergone
democratic transitions.


tices undermine Africa’s long-term development
by corrupting elites, dominating extractive industries, and locking countries into unsustainable
and opaque debts and commitments.

The United States seeks sovereign African states
that are integrated into the world economy, able
to provide for their citizens’ needs, and capable of
managing threats to peace and securit . Improved
governance in these states supports economic
development and opportunities, diminishes the
