# Foreword

Since	 taking	 oath	 in	 office	 as	 President	 of	 Romania,	 I	 have	 expressed	 my	 will	 and commitment	to	ensure	Romania's	assertion	as	a	strong	nation	of	citizens,	fully	aware	of	what it	strives	for	in	Europe,	in	the	world	and	for	itself.	My	belief	stands	firm.	The	force	of	a	nation derives	 from	 its	 common	 values,	 objectives	 and	 aspirations	 which	 transcend	 the	 sum	 of individual	interests,	ambitions	and	achievements.		
Romania's	 national	 defense	 strategy	 is	 the	 clear‐cut	 expression	 of	 this	 vision.	A **strong**
Romania within Europe and the **world**	 is	 the	 clearest	 expression	 of	 the	 Strategy's	 final objective,	 and	 defines	 the	 profile	 that	 our	 country	 will	 build	 in	 the	 next	 five	 years	 and, implicitly,	in	the	long	term.	

First	 of	 all,	 a	 strong	 Romania	 within	 Europe	 and	 the	 world	is	 a state that ensures the security of its citizens wherever they **are.** This	statement	includes	many	aspects.	Ensuring citizens'	 security	 means	 respecting	 them	 at	 home,	 protecting	 their	 rights	 and	 liberties nationally	and	abroad,	actually	making	the	institutions	work	for	the	citizens`	benefit	(as	they are	meant	 to	 be),	 as	well	 as	 providing	 security	 for	 their	 communities,	legal	 guarantees	 and dip t loma ic	protection	abroad.		
This	goal	 can	 only	 be	achieved	 through	 constant	 connection	with	 field	 realities,	 through continuous	factual	assessment	and	through	understanding	of	phenomena	and	challenges	that define	the	present	situation.	As	a	result,	a	strong	Romania	is	a	state	that	will	develop	its	own capacity	to	efficiently	and	pragmatically	operate	within	a	different	paradigm,	able	to	respond to	new	realities	and	to	anticipate	evolutions	of	the	security	environment.	Acknowledging	the changes	that	have	occurred	over	the	past	years	in	the	geopolitical	environment	represents	the first	necessary	step	in	building	a	Strategy	that	is	well‐anchored	in	reality,	which	identifies	the most	appropriate	lines	of	action.		
Secondly,	a	strong	Romania	defends	its	core	values,	interests	and	symbols,	national	assets and	 natural	 resources,	 as	 well	 as	 its	 institutions.	 Priority	 must	 be	 given	 to	 education	 and healthcare,	 to	 heritage	 and	 environment	 protection,	 as	 well	 as	 to	 support	 of	 areas	 of excellence.		
Last,	but	not	least,	a	strong	Romania	supports	the	preservation	of	collective	security	and the	promotion	of	democracy	and	freedom.		
This	 implies	 that	 Romania	 will	 reinforce	 its	 strategic **credibility**,	 will	 be	 known	 for	 its predictable	and	constant	stance	on	defining	its	foreign,	security	and	defense	policies,	as	well as	on	strengthening	democracy	and	the	rule	of	law.	A	strong	Romania	not	only	benefits	from the	complete	trust	of	its	partners,	but	also	provides	confidence,	stability	in	an	intricate	region, and	solid	respect	for	democratic	values	and	principles.		
More	 than	10	 years	have	passed	since	Romania's	NATO	accession	and	8	 years	 since	 our country's	EU	accession	as	a	 full‐fledged	member.	The	road	 that	we	have	pursued	since	 then deserves	proper	acknowledgment	and	appreciation.	Romania	has	changed	during	this	period, and	 the	 National	 Defense	 Strategy	 intends	 to	 reassert,	 with	 utmost	 responsibility,	 the irreversible	 feature	 of	 this	 path	 and	 of	 its	 implicit	 commitments.	 The	 Strategic	 Partnership with	 the	 United	 States	 of	 America	 and	 the	 NATO	 and	 EU	 memberships	 represent	 the	 key pillars	of	our	foreign	policy.	Building	strong	Romania	is	also	closely	linked	to	these	pillars.

* *          *
The	National	Defense	Strategy	 falls	 under	 the	 prerogatives	 of	 the	 President	 of	Romania.	

This	document	isn't	and	mustn't	represent	the	will	of	a	sole	person,	even	if	that	person	holds the	 highest	 office	within	 the	 state,	 nor	 the	will	 of	 several	institutions.	The	National	Defense Strategy	is	more	 than	 that.	 It	aims	 to	meet	society's	needs	and	expectations	and	it	concerns each	citizen,	the	society	as	a	whole,	as	well	as	state	institutions.	Thus,	drawing	up	the	National Defense	Strategy	involved	several	consultations	with	experts,	political	factors,	representatives of	the	institutions	 ith	attribut w ions	in	this	field,	members	of	Academia	and	civil	society.		
I	 have	 always	 believed	 that	 national	 security	 policy	 (through	 all	 its	 elements),	 must	 be subject	 to	 dialogue	 and	 consensus	 throughout	 Romanian	 society.	As	 President,	 my	 mission and	responsibility	is	to	integrate	foreign	and	security	policies	in	order	to	defend	and	promote our	national	interests.		

# Introduction

. 

1.	According	to	the	provisions	of	the	Constitution	of	Romania	and	the	Law	no.473/2004	on defense	planning,	Romania's	National	Defense	Strategy	(hereinafter,	the *Strategy*)	represents the	 main	 instrument	 that	 substantiates	 defense	 planning	 at	 national	 level	 and	 ensures	 the strategic	 framework	 for	 the	 whole	 organization	 and	 coordination	 of	 the	 related	 to	 the count s ry's	defen e	and	national	security,	through	the	Supreme	Council	of	National	Defense.		
2.	 Through	 its	 objectives	 and	 content,	 the	 Strategy	 refers	 to	 the	 country's	 defense	 and national	 security	 as	 a	 whole.	 Paradigm	 changes	 that	 occurred	 in	 the	 concept	 of	 country's defense	 and	 national	 security,	 related	 to	 the	 increasingly	 unpredictable	 dynamics	 of	 the security	 environment,	 inflict	 the	 need	 to	 reanalyze	 the	 concept	 and,	 in	 the	 immediate prospect,		to	update	the	national	legal	framework.		
3.	 The	 Strategy	 reflects	 the	 need	 to	 promote	 an	 extensive	national security **concept**	 –	
grounded	 on	 constitutional	 democracy	 and	 mutual	 respect	 between	 state	 and	 citizens	 - regarding	 interests	 related	 to	 ensuring	 national	 security	 in	 the	 following	 fields:	 defense (perceived	in	 a	 double	 normative	 stance	 of	 national	 defense	 and	 collective	 defense),	 public order,	 intelligence,	 counterintelligence	 and	 security	 activity,	 education,	 healthcare,	 the economic	field,	the	financial	sector,	environment	and	critical	infrastructure.	The	Strategy	has an	integrative	and	multidimensional	approach,	whereby	 the	 defense	 dimension	merges	and mutually	 balances	 along	 other	 dimensions	 –	 public	 order;	 intelligence,	 counterintelligence and	security	activity;	diplomacy;	crisis	management;	education,	healthcare	and	d mo e graphy.		
4.	 The	 need	 to	 extend	 the	 concept	 of	 national	 security	 is	 also	 motivated	 by	 **ensuring**
convergence with the European security **principles**,	 developed	in	 the	 European	Security Strategy	 and	 the	 European	 Union`s	 Internal	 Security	 Strategy,	 in	 which	 security	 and development	are	defined	as	directly	proportional.	In	addition,	the	extension	of	the	concept	of national	 security	 aims	 to	 ensure	 increased	 resilience	 of	 state	 institutions	 and	 civil	 society against	 possible,	 fortuitous	 or	 persistent,	 crisis	 situations	 in	 an	 unpredictable	 international security	environment	and	within	an	intricate	security	context.	

5.	In	drawing	up	the	new	Strategy	we	must	take	into	consideration	the	change	of	paradigm at	global	level.	Romania	lies	in	a	 region	 that	was	defined	 for	a	long	 time	by	 the	presence	of frozen	conflicts.	Today,	 the	region	is	marked	by	active	conflicts	and	 the	deterioration	of	 the relations	 between	 NATO	 and	 the	 Russian	 Federation.	 Also,	 the	 presence	 of	 conflict	 areas within	the	region	raises	the	issue	of	the	Romanian	citizens'	security.		
6.	 At	 global	 level,	 terrorism has acquired new **dimensions**,	 being	 far	 from	 a	 distant phenomenon,	 but	 rather	 close	 to	 our	 space.	 Romanian	 citizens	 can	 be	 affected	 by	 the consequences	 of	 terrorist	 acts.	 The	 economic	 and	 financial	 crisis	 has	in	 turn	 contributed	 to this	paradigm	change,	and	its	effects	are	felt	in	the	long	ter .		
m 7.	 Romania	 is	 crossing	 a	 period	 where	 multiple	 risks,	 threats	 and	 vulnerabilities sometimes	 intersect	 and	 at	 times	 overlap,	 giving	 rise	 to	 unforeseeable	 effects	 not	 only	 at 5 natio nal	or	regional	level,	but	also	at	global	level.		
8.	National	security	cannot	be	ensured	individually	by	a	sole	state,	the	new	challenges	of the	 security	 environment	 require	 effective	 and	 efficient	 collaboration	 within	 international cooperation	mechanisms	and	formats.		
9.	 In	 order	 to	 responsibly	 manage	 the	 impact	 of	 such	 strategic	 surprises,	 beyond knowledge	 of	 evolutions	 in	 the	 security	 environment,	 national	 cohesion	 and	 consensus	 are needed	more	than	ever	in	facing	vital	issues	for	our	country.		
10.	In	order	to	secure	necessary	resources	in	the	security	field,	a	strong	market	economy is	required,	based	on	free	initiative	and	transparent	competition.		
11. The	 strategy	 aims	 to	 set	 forth	 the	 necessary	 steps	 for	 strengthening Romania's strategic **credibility**,	by	promoting	continuity	and	predictability	derived	from	our	NATO	and EU	membership	statute.	The	extension	and	consolidation	of	the	Strategic	Partnership	with	the United	 States	 of	 America	 and	 of	 other	 strategic	 partnerships	 are	 also	 necessary,	 along	with those	of	cooperation	relations	with	the	other	international	players.		
12.	From	this	perspective,	objectives	and	lines	of	action	regarding	national	security	aim	at the	 consolidation	 of	 military	 and	 national	 civil	 capacities	 by	 standards	 that	 allow	 the prevention,	deterrence,	and	defense	against	any	aggressive	actions	targeting	our	country.	Of equal	 importance	 are	 Romania's	 active	 participation	 in	 collective	 defense	 within	 NATO,	 in implementing	 the	 solidarity	 and	 mutual	 assistance	 clause	 under	 the	 provisions	 of	 the European	Union	Lisbon	Treaty,	as	well	as	in	developing	the	European	Common	Security	and Defense	 Policy,	 and	 the	 operations	 related	 to	 ensuring	 the	 European	 space	 of	 freedom, security	and	justice.		
13.	The	Strategy	defines	national	security	interests	and	objectives,	presents	an	evaluation of	 the	 security	 environment,	identifies	 the	main	 threats,	 risks	 and	 vulnerabilities	 related	 to Romania's	 fundamental	interests	and	lays	out	 the	main	lines	of	action	 for	ensuring	national security.		
14. The Strategy represents a moral and political duty, taking into consideration that the centennial of the Union of the Romanian Principalities will be celebrated in 2018, and the fact that in 2019, for the first time, Romania will take over the presidency of The Council of the European Union, more than a decade since its EU accession.		

# Chapter I Defining National **Security** Interests And **Objectives**

## . 1.1. Values And **Principles**

15.	As	a	European	country	and	EU	and	NATO	member,	Romania	is	a	democratic	and	social state	of	law,	which	shares	 the	same	core	values	as	 the	other	member	states:	human	dignity, civil	 rights	 and	 liberties,	 free	 development	 of	 the	 human	 personality,	 justice	 and	 pluralism, and	equality	under	the	law.		
16.	In	defining	national	security	interests	and	objectives,	the	Strategy	is	grounded	on	the following	**values**:	
 **dignity**,	viewed	as	a	human	being's		essential	attribute; civic cohesion and assertion of national **identity,**	 as	 common aspirations	of	the	community	of	citizens	united	within	the	state; constitutional democracy and the rule of **law,**	 namely	 participative political	 culture,	 political	 pluralism,	 separation	 and	 balance	 of	 state powers,	guaranteeing	 fundamental	civil	rights	and	liberties,	and	respect towards	constitutional	and	legal	provisions;			
 Romania's state and territorial **integrity**,	based	on	citizens'	and	public institutions'	loyalty	towards	national	sovereignty.		
17.	 In	 order	 to	 promote	 these	 values,	 the	 Strategy	 is	 based	 on	 respecting	 the	 following principles:
 **continuity**,	a	principle	 that	derives	 from	 the	need	 for	coherent	policies through	 which	 Romania	 builds	 its	 future	 and	 integrates	 within	 the European	 and	 Euro‐Atlantic	 community.	 Thus,	 maintaining	 the	 same vision	 and	 lines	 of	 cooperation	 within	 NATO,	 European	 Union	 and	 our strategic	 partnerships,	 mainly	 the	 strategic	 partnership	 with	 the	 US, provides	 Romania	 with	 the	 conditions	 required	 to	 increase	 its	 conflict prevention	 and	 crisis	 management	 capacity,	 as	 well	 its	 operational threat‐respons 	 a e cap city;	
 **predictability**,	 in	 drawing	 up	 and	 implementing	 national	 security policies	 internally	 and	 at	 a	 foreign	 policy	 level,	 while	 firmly	 respecting the	 principles,	 mechanisms	 and	 procedures	 for	 consultation,	 decision‐ making	and	planning	rallied	in	order	to	enhance	Romania's	contribution to	collective	defense;	
 **legality**,	a	principle	that	involves	the	bona *fide*	 fulfillment	of	obligations 7 assumed	 by	 Romania	 at	 the	 national,	 European	 and	international	level, when	 acting	 to	 ensure	 and	 guarantee	 the	 defense	 of	 the	 country,	 of	its citizens	 and	 of	 their	 fundamental	 rights,	 as	 well	 as	 when	 preventing risks,	fighting	threats	and	minimizing	vulnerabilities	that	could	increase the	former;	
 **proportionality**,	a	principle	which	aims	to	identify	the	adequate	lines	of action	 required	 to	 ensure	 national	 security,	 determined	 by	 the established	objectives	and	assigned		resources.		
18.	 In	order	 to	safeguard	abovementioned	values	and	principles,	 the	Strategy	assumes	a pragmatic	 and	 operational	 character	 by	 encouraging	 the	 initiative	 and	 the	 joint	 effort	 of institutions	 authorized	 for	 implementing	 defense	 and	 security	 policies,	 as	 well	 as	 by efficiently	coordinating	their	actions.	

## 1.2. National Security **Interests**

19.	In	defining	national	security	interests,	the	Strategy	relates	mainly	to	the	Constitutional provisions	which	assert	Romania	as	a	national,	sovereign,	independent	and	indivisible	state. National	interests	naturally	result	from	these	provisions,	including	security	interests,	closely related	 to	 legitimately	 promoting	 and	 safeguarding	 the	 core	 values	 that	 guarantee	 the existence,	the	identity,	the	development	and	the	stability	of	the	Romanian	state.	These	are	the core	values	on	which	Romania	builds	its	 future	and	contributions	 for	ensuring	international security.	

20.	National	security	interests	are:	 	
 guaranteeing	 the	 state's	 national	 character,	 sovereignty,	 independence, unity	and	indivisibility;		
 defending	the	country's	territorial	integrity	a d	inalienabilit n y; defending	 and	 consolidating	 constitutional	 democracy	 and	 the	 rule	 of law; protecting	 fundamental	 rights	 and	 liberties	 of	 all	 citizens	 and guaranteeing	their	safety; guaranteeing	 the	 right	 to	 preservation,	 development	 and	 expression	 of ethnic,	cultural,	linguistic	and	 religious	identity	 of	persons	belonging	 to national	minorit ;	 ies capitalizing	 on	 our	 country's	 resources	 and	 geostrategic	 position,	 in order	to	reach	the	welfare	level	that	citizens	are	entitled	to; reducing	development	disparities	and	the	reconstruction	of	major	public systems; ensuring	 the	 irreversible	 nature	 of	 belonging	 to	 the	 trans‐Atlantic n yst collective	defe se	s em; consolidating	 the	 European	 Union	 and	 actively	 participating	 in	

# 1.3. National Security **Objectives**

21.	Promoting	national	security	interests	is	enabled	by	the	establishment	of	benchmarks of	the	s fort,	materialized tate	ef 	into	national	security	objectives.		
22.	From	an internal **perspective**,	national	security	objectives	regard:		
 the	 consolidation	 of	 the	 national	 defense	 capacity	 aimed	 at	 ensuring Romania's	territorial	integrity,	sovereignty	and	independence,	as	well	as the	security	of	the	Romanian	people;		
 promoting	 and	 ensuring	 the	 unrestricted	 exercise	 of	 basic	 rights	 and liberties; sound	functioning	of	the	judiciary	and	upholding	of	the	rule	of	law; removing	 deficiencies	 affecting	 good	 governance,	 enhancing administrative	 capacity,	 protecting	 the	 decision‐making	 process	against influences	and/or	illegitimate	or	non‐transparent	actions; securing	 efficiency	 of	 national	 crises	 prevention	 and	 management systems,	both	local	and	external,	as	well	as	military	and	civil; consolidating	 security	 and	 protection	 of	 critical	 infrastructures	 –	 the energy,	 transport	 and	 cyber	 security	 sectors	 –	 as	 well	 as	 food	 and environment	security; developing	capabilities	to	combat	asymmetric	threats; securing	an	efficient,	dynamic	and	competitive	economic	environment,	at an	 investment	 and	 entrepreneurial	 level,	 respectively,	 as	 well	 as	 the state's	financial‐budgetary	stability; sound,	 durable	 and	 socially	 adaptable	 development	 of	 major	 public systems	(healthcare,	education	and	social	welfare);	
 preventing	 radical	 or	 extremist	 reactions	 and	 tendencies,	 by	 observing social	plura ism	and	cultivating l 	tolerance ithin	civil	 oc ety 	w s i ;	
 promoting	 national	 identity,	 including	 by	 means	 of	 preserving	 and capitalizing	 on	 the	 cultural	 and	 natural	 heritage,	 as	 well	 as	 by responsibly	incentivizing	fields	of	excellence.		
23.	 From	 the	 foreign policy **perspective**,	 Romania	 must	 pursue	 the	 elaboration	 of	 a country	profile	that	matches	the	level	of	ambition	assumed	al	the	political	level,	demographic weight	and	economic	development.		
24.	In	this	context,	national	security	objectives	pursue:	
 strengthening	 Romania's	 profile	 within	 NATO	 and	 the	 EU,	 through conceptual,	as	well	as	operational	contributions; observing	the	European	Union's	basic	principles	and	values; consolidating	 the	 strategic	 partnership	 with	 the	 US,	 including	 the economic	and	trade	cooperation;		
 ensuring	security	in	the	Black	Sea	region; deepening	 cooperation	 with	 neighboring	 states	 and	 states	 of	 NATO's Eastern	flank;		
 intensifying	regional	cooperation,	including	in	the	field	of	defense; upholding	the	Republic	of	Moldova's	European	aspirations; promoting	 political,	 economic	 and	 security	 interests	 in	 regions strategically	relevant	for	our	country.		
25.	Internal	and	external	objectives	will	not	be	attained	at	the	desired	scale	in	the	absence of	a	long‐term	 country	 project,	assumed	 by	 the	entire	 political	 class,	a	 project	able	 to	 draw national	consensus,	in	line	with	national	security	interests.		

# Chapter Ii International Security **Environment** Assessment

26.	 The	 current	 security	 environment	 within	 which	 Romania	 defends	 and	 promotes	 its values,	 principles,	 strategic	 and	 security	 goals	 and	 interests	 is	 characterized	 by	 complexity and	dynamism,	as	a	consequence	of	having	revised	the	strategic	and	military	stance	of	some states	 as	 well	 as	 the	 political,	 economic	 and	 technological	 interdependences	 caused	 by globali o zati n.	

27.	 In	 perspective,	 the	 security	 environment	 will	 be	 further	 on	 influenced	 by	 multiple challenges,	 some	 of	 those	 having	 predictable	 and	 linear	 manifestations,	 representing consequences	of	some	strategies	aimed	at	by	various	state	or	non‐state	actors	on	long	term, while	 others,	 on	 the	 contrary,	 have	 an	 unpredictable	 non‐linear	 and	 profoundly	 disruptive charac e hich	may	generat t r,	w e	strategic	surprises.	

28.	 The	 European	 environment	 is	 undertaking	 a	 demographic	 transformation	 process with	 strategic	 implications.	 Demographic	 transformations	 are	 verifiable	 at	 statistical	 level, those	will	persist	 for	a	long	time,	and	their	implications	are	both	positive	and	negative.	This type	 of	 systemic	 transformations	 will	 impact	 differently	 upon	 the	 European	 states	 and	 the regions	 adjacent	 to	 those,	 while	 their	 impact	 upon	 the	 European	 security	 and	 Romania's security	will	be	a	distinct	one,	long	term	speaking.		

## 2.1. The Global Security **Environment**

29.	At	the	global	level,	the	security	environment	is	undertaking	an	ongoing	transformation process,	 which	 reflects	 mainly	 upon	 highlighting	 interdependences	 and	 unpredictability within	international	relations	system	and	the	difficulty	to	delimitate	classical	risks	and	threats from	the	asymmetric	and	hybrid	ones.	

30.	On	medium	and	long	term,	the	evolutions	regarding	the	security	environment	will	be dominated	 by	 complex	 trends,	 whose	 knowledge	 is,	 for	 our	 country,	 of	 paramount importance:	 ●	 redefining	 geo‐strategical	 "games";	 ●	 rapid	 development	 of	 informational technology;	 ●	 the	 resurgence	 of	 nationalism	 and	 extremism;	 ●	 ethnical	 and	 religious fragmentation	and	ideological	radicalization;	●	adapting	critical	infrastructures	in	relation	to the	occ urrence	of	calamities,	energetic	crisis,	cyber	attacks,	pandemics.		
31.	The	high	level	of	uncertainty	of	the	evolutions	in	the	security	environment,	correlated with	 internal	 and	 external	 factors	 which	 influence	 Romania's	 route,	 impose	 new	 ways	 of acting,	 based	 on	 a	 medium	 and	 long	 term	 vision.	 The	 dynamics	 of	 the	 current	 security environment	highlights	two	main	challenges:	the	identification	of	constancies	and	foreseeing any	 possible	 internal,	 regional	 and	 international	 phenomena	 which	 might	 impact	 upon Roman ia's	national	security.	

32.	 In	 foreseeing	 and	 preventing	major	 security	issues	 at	 the	 global	level,	 an	important part	is	played	by	the	United	Nations	Organization	both	when	it	comes	to	consultations	as	well as	to	decision	making	related	to	solving	some	regional	crisis.	Disputing	more	frequently	lately the	 international	 regime	 of	 some	 treaties	 and	 understandings	 regarding	 armament, deployment	and	stationing	of	troops	and	military	capabilities,	and	the	measures	to	strengthen confidence	 and	 security	 at	 regional	 and	 international	 level	 may	 deepen	 fragmentation, divisions	 and	 cleavages,	 generating	 a	 turbulent	 reconfiguration	 at	 the	 international relationships	level.	

## 2.2. Security Dimensions At Euroatlantic **Level**

33.	 Romania's	 position	 on	 the	 Eastern	 flank	 of	 the	 North‐Atlantic	 Alliance	 and	 of	 the European	Union,	as	well	as	at	 the	crossroads	of	some	areas	with	a	high	security	shows	 that defense	 and	 security	 surpass	 the	 area	 of	 responsibility	 of	 a	 single	 state.	 It	 is	 necessary	 to revisit	some	concepts	and	establish	new	measures	to	ensure	predictability	and	consensus	in handling	 national	 instruments	 both	 independently,	 as	 well	 as	 in	 allied	 and	 community context,	 OSCE	 being,	 in	 this	 regard,	 an	 important	 element	 within	 the	 European	 security system.	

34.	 The	 main	 warranty	 provider	 when	 it	 comes	 to	 Romania's	 security	 is	 The	 North Atlantic **Alliance**,	 the	 transatlantic	 relationship	 representing	 the	 strategic	 binder	 which awards	 coherence	 and	 consistency	 to	 NATO	 actions.	 The	 solidity	 of	 the	 transatlantic relationship	depends	on	the	United	States'	maintaining	their	commitment	in	Europe,	as	well as	 the	way	allies	and	European	 partners	will	allot	 financial	assistance	 to	 develop	 their	 own defense	capabilities.	

35.	 An	 important	 actor	 in	 the	 European	 and	 Euro	 Atlantic	 environment	 is	 the	Russian Federation.	Its	actions	in	the	Black	Sea	Region,	infringing	upon	international	law,	questioning international	 order,	 preserving	 frozen	 conflicts	 and	 the	 annexation	 of	 Crimea	 have	 raised again	the	NATO	awareness	upon	fulfilling	its	fundamental	mission	that	is	collective **defense**, as	well	as	the	validity	of	the	security	arrangements	agreed	upon	with	Russia	at	the	end	of	the XXth	ce ntury.

36.	 The	 European	 security	 architecture	 has	 been	 under	 constant	 threat	 by	 crisis	 and conflicts	 which	 are	 ongoing	in	 the	 close	 vicinity,	in	 the	 East	 and	 in	 the	 South,	 which	 might impact,	 directly	 or	 indirectly	 upon	 Romania's	 national	 security	 interests.	 The	 recent evolutions	 in	 the	 Eastern Neighborhood, in the Middle East and the Northern **Africa** generate	 multiple	 challenges	 to	 the	 security	 of	 the	 community	 environment,	 thus	 the	 need that	 the	 European	 Union	 revise	 and	 strengthen	 its	 policies	 in	 the	 field	 of	 security	 and collective	defense	and	internal	affairs	becomes	more	obvious.		
37.	The	emerging terrorist **groups**	stimulate	 the	 Islamic	 radicalization	phenomenon	at European	level,	highlighting	 the	 risks	posed	by	 returning	 to	 the	community	environment	 of the	European	jihadists,	who	were	had	been	previously	engaged	in	fights	or	training	programs in	state rrorist	agen s	having	a	very	active	te da.	

38.	 The	 intensification	 of	 **migration** from	 the	 conflict	 areas	 or	 from	 areas	 with	 a	 poor economic	 situation	 has	 generated	 challenges	 to	 the	 capability	 of	 some	 member	 states	 to manage	the	flow	of	ilegal	immigrants	and	integrate	those	into	the	local	community.	

## 2.3. The Regional Security **Environment**

39.	 At	 regional	 and	 sub‐regional	 level,	 the	 environment	 in	 which	 Romania	 defends	 and promotes	 its	 values,	 principles	 and	 interests	 is	 going	 through	 a new phase of reconfiguration.	 The	 current	 security	 dynamics	 may	 impact	 both	 directly	 and	 indirectly upon	Romania's	security	situation	and	the	security	of	its	citizens.		
40.	Romania	has	an	obligation	to	maintain	the	strategic	balance	at	the	crossroads	of	some regional	 security	 complexes,	 but	 also	 to	 contribute	 to	 the	 strengthening	 of	 the Europeanization	process	by gradual extension of the European environment of **freedom,** prosperity, security and **justice**.	

41. Regional **cooperation**,	by	strengthening	the	Eastern	and	Southern	dimensions	of	the vicinity	policies	of	the	European	Union,	has	undergone	a	constant	increase.	

42. The Russian **Federation**	is	trying	to	consolidate	its	status	as	a	power	at	the	regional level,	its	actions	having	an	impact	upon	regional	stability	and	 the	European	path	of	Ukraine, The	Republic	of	Moldova	and	Georgia.	

43.	The	perpetuation	of	instability	in	the	Western **Balkans**	generates	populist,	extremist, radical	 and	 even	 fundamentalist	 sideslips	 by	 deepening	 some	 historical	 cleavages	 and	 by infringing	upon	the	rights	of	the	ethnical	communities,	encouraging	thus	organized	crime	and corruption.	

44. The regional energetic **architecture**	 may	 undergo	 alterations	 determined	 by possible	 syncopes	in	exploiting	energetic	 resources	in	 the	 Pontic	area	and	 developing	 some energetic	projects	competitive	to	those	supported	by	the	European	Union	and	Romania.	

45.	 Questioning	 the	 liberal values **system**,	 the	 sideslips	 from	 the	 state	 law	 rules	 and regulations,	 the	 authoritarian	 drives	 in	 exerting	 power;	 exacerbation	 of	 the	 nationalist	 and populist	 discourse	 determines	 the	 increase	 of	 regional	 instability	 and	 the	 decrease	 of	 the security	feeling	in	the	area.	

# Chapter Iii Threats,Risksandvulnerabilities

46.	Traditionally,	threats,	risks	and	vulnerabilities	related	to	national	defense	and	security are	assessed	against	some	military	concepts,	but	the	current	security	environment	calls	upon an	 extended	 approach,	within	which	 one	 could	 find,	 besides	 the	 security	 related	issues,	 the economic,	social,	political,	technological	and	environment	issues.	

47.	Threats	represent	capabilities,	strategies,	intentions	or	plans	which	may	impact	upon the	national	security	values,	interests	and	goals.	

48.	Risks	represent	the	probability	of	manifestation	of	an	uncertain	event,	having	direct	or indirect	impact	upon	national	security.		
49.	Vulnerabilities	are	consequences	of	some	systemic	disruptions	or	shortcomings,	which may	be	exploited	or	may	contribute	to	the	occurrence	of	a	threat	or	of	a	risk.	

50.	The	deterioration	of	 the	security	situation	at	the	international	level,	but	especially	at the	regional	level,	calls	upon	knowing	the	main	threats,	risks	and	vulnerabilities	our	country confronts	with,	in	the	context	of	the	occurrence	and,	possibly,	development	of	a	new	form	of influence	 and	 constraint,	 as	 a	 result	 of	 a	 mixture	 of	 conventional	 and	 unconventional components.	

## . 3.1. **Threats**

51. The actions performed to **destabilize** the	Eastern	vicinity	generate	major	challenges to	 the	 security	 of	 the	 Euro	 Atlantic	 environment,	 causing	 regional	 instability	 and	 possible negative	 phenomena,	 amongst	 which	 we	 can	 mention	 migration,	 organized	 crime,	 and	 also alteration	of	the	economic	growth	potential.	

52. The perpetuation of the frozen conflicts in the Black Sea Region and the instability in the Western **Balkans**	 generate	 additional	 pressures	 for	 Romania.	 Inter‐ ethnical	tensions	and	the	regional	imbalances	in	the	states	situated	at	the	proximity	may	lead to	the	unleash	of	some	regional	conflicts.		
53. The distortions on the energetic **markets**	 and	 the	 competitive	 projects	 of	 some state	 or	 non‐state	 actors	 alter	 Romania's	 efforts	 to	 provide	 a	 sufficient	 level	 of	 energetic security.	

14 54. The cyber **threats** initiated	by	hostile	entities,	state	or	non‐state,	upon	informational infrastructures	 posing	 strategic	interest	 of	 the	 public	institutions	 and	 companies,	 the	 cyber attacks	performed	by	cyber	crime	groups	or	the	extremist	cyber	attacks	initiated	by	hackers alter	d y	Roma irectl nia's	national	security.	

55. **Terrorism**	 is	 a	 persistent	 threat,	 having	 forms	 of	 manifestation	 very	 difficult	 to foresee	and	 counter,	including	 from	 the	 perspective	 of	identification	and	 de‐structuring	 the flows	of	recruitment	and	financing	those	activities.	The	national	contingencies	which	take	part in	missions	abroad	are	exposed	to	risks	and	threats	generated	by	the	actions	of	the	terrorist forces,	 organizations	 and	 groups.	 The	 increasing	 fundamentalist	 propaganda,	 especially virtually,	 favors	 the	 appearance	 of	 new	 cases	 of	 radicalization	 or	 of	implication	in	 terrorist extremist	actions.	

56. The proliferation of the weapons of mass‐destruction proliferation and of the bearing **vectors**,	as	well	as	the	traffic	of	dual‐use	products,	may	alter	national	security	in	the context	of	a	destabilization	at	the	regional	level.	

57. The hostile informational **actions**,	which	 trigger	the	development	of	some	support points	 on	 national	 territory,	 especially	 with	 an	 influential	 purpose,	 may	 impede	 Romania's strategic	projects	and	its	decisions	at	the	state	level.		

## 3.2. **Risks**

58. Regional **instability**	 limits	 Romania's	 ability	 to	 promote	 its	 strategic	 interests, especially	those	regarding	supporting	Moldova's	European	route,	solving	the	frozen	conflicts, ensuring	 energetic	 security,	 protecting	 the	 rights	 of	 the	 Romanian	 communities	 and	 of	 the economic	activities	performed	in	the	Exclusive	Economic	Zone	of	Romania	at	the	Black	Sea.	

59. The un‐fulfillment of Romania's **development**	 goals	 can	 be	 generated	 by	 the persistence	 of	 the	 economic	 difficulties,	 proliferation	 of	 the	 underground	 economy	 and	 of corruption,	tax	evasion,	the	insecurity	of	infrastructure,	as	well	as	by	external	factors	such	as the	perpetuation	of	the	development	gaps	at	the	European	Union	level	and	the	low	degree	of resistance	 to	 the	 major	 issues	 on	 the	 external	 markets,	 especially	 in	 the	 financial‐banking area.	

60. Risks of social **nature** persist	 on	 the	 background	 of	 some	 trends	 such	 as	 the demographic	fall,	the	migration	of	the	active	population,	the	degradation	of	the	environment factors,	 the	shortcomings/deficiencies	in	 the	national	health,	education	and	social	assistance systems,	but	also	the	distortions	on	the	labor	market.	

61. Radicalization of the extremist **entities**	present	on	Romania's	national	territory	may occur	in	the	context	of	the	intensification	of	the	extremist	flows	of	ethnic	or	religious	nature or	of	any	other	nature.	

62. Border **criminality**	 from	 drugs,	 people,	 armament	 and	 goods	 smuggling,	 illegal migration	to	economic‐financial	criminality	is	another	phenomenon	which	might	impact	upon Romania's	national	security.	

63. Illegal smuggling of conventional **armament** may	 derive	 from	 some	 state	 or	 non‐
state	 actors'	 interest	 to	 perform	 such	 operations,	 targeting	 conflict	 areas	 or	 areas	 having	 a potential	to	turn	into	an	armed	conflict.	

64. Risks with low probability, but major **impact** remain	 of	 interest	 for	 national security:	 military	 confrontations	 of	 low	 intensity,	 but	 persistent	 in	 time,	 migration	 flows generated	by	natural	disasters,	pandemics,	ecologic	disasters.	

## 3.3. **Vulnerabilities**

65.	 The	 ability	 of	 the	 state	 institutions	 to	 assess	 and	 diminish	 the	 impact	 of	 risks	 and threats	is	limited	by	the	persistence	of	some	vulnerability	in: absorption of European funds, using public funds, energy, critical infrastructure, agriculture, environment protection, justice, health, education and scientific **research**.	 The	 inexistence	 of	 a	 real	 multiannual budget	planning	to	determine	taking	the	responsibility	for	and	fulfillment	of	some	investment programs	has	negative	effects,	including	in	relation	to	increasing	the	capabilities	of	the	armed forces	 nd	following	commitments	regarding	military	expenditure a .		
66. The ability of the central and local administration to implement national and European public **policies** represents	another	vulnerability.	

67.	 The	 inter‐institutional	 reaction	 in	 crisis	 situations	 is	 altered	 by	 the	 **insecurity** of resources	and	the	incoherence	in	managing	various	types	of	risks.	This	vulnerability	becomes even	 more	 important	 if	 we	 refer	to	 the	 interoperability	 ability	 of	 various	 state	 institutions which	must	take	actions	should	any	asymmetric	or	hybrid	threats	occur.	

68. **Corruption**	makes	 the	 state	 vulnerable,	generates	 prejudices	 to	economy	and	alters the	country's	development	potential,	the	governance	in	good	conditions,	the	decision‐making process	in	the	best	interest	of	the	citizens	and	of	the	community,	as	well	as	the	confidence	in justice	 and	 state	 institutions.	 Externally,	 the	 persistence	 of	 corruption	 has	 negative	 impact upon	credibility	and	our	country's	image.	

69.	Other	vulnerabilities	derive	from	exclusion	and	social	polarization,	the	poverty	degree, the	demographic	 fall,	migration	of	the	specialized	work	force,	the	socio‐economic	disparities between	regions	and	counties,	the	fragility	of	the	spirit	and	the	civic	solidarity.	

# Chapter Iv Lines Of Action And Main **Ways** To Ensure Romania'S National **Security**

## . 4.1. **Premises**

70.	 The	 national	 security	 goals	 and	 interests	 represent	 the	 basis	 on	 which	 the	 main directions	 and	 the	 ways	 to	 ensure	 the	 national	 security	 are	 grounded	 in	 a	 dynamic	 and complex	international	security	environment.	Furthermore,	the	lines	of	actions	come	under	the obligation	 to	 prevent,	 fight	 and	 respond	 to	 potential	 threats,	 risks	 and	 vulnerabilities	 that Romania	 may	 face	 over	 the	 following	 five	 years	 and	 in	 the	 long	 run,	 in	 a	 credible	 manner, under	the	constitutional	principle	of	unitary	coordination.		
71.	The	lines	of	action	and	ways	to	ensure	Romania's	national	security	aim	at:	
 Strengthening strategic **credibility**	through	stability	and	predictability, both	at	home	and	abroad.	Consolidating	strategic	credibility	is	based	on strengthening	 the	 defense	 capabilities,	 public	 order	 and	 security	 at national	level,	as	well	as	on	securing	a		collective	response	regarding	the defense	 of	 the	 Euro‐Atlantic	 space	 and	 a	 joint	 reaction	 needed	 for	 the consolidation	of	freedom,	security	and	justice	w t e ro i hin	th 	Eu pean	space;		
 Ensuring a congruous legal **framework,**	 both	 for	 the	 unitary coordination	of	activities	on	the	country's	defense	and	national	security at	the	level	of	the	Supreme	Council	of	National	Defense,	as	well	as	for	the organization	and	functioning	of	institutions	with	competence	in	the	field, in	 line	 with	 new	 security	 challenges,	 and	 particularly	 for	 a	 full adjustment	 to	 the	 NATO	 and	 EU	 membership	 condition.	 A	 legal framework	 tailored	 to	 the	 requirements	of	collective	defense	principles of	the	European	space	of	freedom,	security	and	justice,	calls	for	security strengthening	 by	 enhancing	 the	 respect	 for	 the	 basic	 rights	 and	 the principles	of	constitutional	democracy; Enhancing inter‐institutional **collaboration** to	 identify	 and	 meet strategic	national	security	goals.	This	will	be	the	key	element	needed	for transition	 from	a	sector	wide	approach	 to	a	more	coherent	and	 flexible inter‐institutional	planning	conception; Focusing on **prevention** and	 preventive	 mechanisms	 in	 the	 field	 of national	 security	 and	 country's	 defense,	 namely	 better	 anticipation, knowledge,	 and	 construction	 of	 an	 integrated	 responsiveness,	 that should	 be	 balanced,	 flexible	 and	 supple.	 In	 the	 current	 context,	 besides	

## 17

knowing	 the	 risks	 and	 threats,	 in	 all	 aspects	 –	 sources,	 ways	 of expression,	means	and	techniques	–	developing	the	anticipation	capacity, based	 on	 knowledge	 and	 education,	 is	 fundamental.	 To	 this	 end, developing	 appropriate	 systems	 for	 the	 early	 spotting	 of	 dangers,	 risks and	 threats,	 with	 a	 view	 to	 preventing	 their	 occurrence,	 through	 a combined	use	of	military	means	and	civil	instru ments,	is	mandatory;		
 Allocating resources through an **integrated**,	continuous,	multi‐annual and	 rigorous	 planning	 **process**,	 able	 to	 respond	 both	 to	 new	 inter‐ institutional	 planning	 demands,	 at	 a	 national	 level,	 and	 to	 rigors	 of principles	of	multi‐annual	budget	planning	habitual	to	NATO	and	the	EU.

# Final **Considerations**

81.	In	the	spirit	of	values	and	principles	on	the	grounds	of	which	the	Strategy	was	set	up, meeting	its	goals	entails	a	joint	effort	at	the	level	of	the	political	class	and	the	civil	society,	as well	 as	 the	 efficient	 use	 of	 our	 country's	 human,	 material	 and	 financial	 resources.	 It	 is desirable	 that	 the	 political	 class	 take	 on	 the	 worded	 interests	 and	 objectives,	 by	 ensuring decision	transparency	and	the	judicious	use	of	public	funds,	and	that	the	civil	society	become involved	in	the	development	of	the	security	culture	and	in		the	open	debate	of	security	issues.		
82.	Strategic	consistency	and	coherence	rely	on	the	convergence	of	objectives	and	lines	of action	put	forward	by	the	National	Defense	Strategy,	the	Programme	for	Government	and	the planning	 documents	 at	 the	 NATO	 and	 the	 EU	 level.	 This	 convergence	 must	 be	 pursued through	 setting	 up	 priorities	 and	 making	 objectives	 viable,	 budget	 planning	 and	 proper resource	allocation.			
83.	 A	 necessary	 condition	 for	 making	 the	 Strategy	 operational	 is	 the	 revision	 of	 the legislative	 framework	 in	 the	 field	 of	 national	 security.	 Beside	 flaws	 displayed	 in	 time,	 this revision	must	take	into	consideration	the	new	threats	and	the	need	to	observe	civil	rights	and liberties.	In	order	to	attain	the	objectives	and	to	accomplish	the	directions	shouldered	by	the current	 Strategy,	 institutions	 with	 competence	 in	 the	 field	 will	 elaborate	 the	 subsequent sector	wide	strategies,	programs	and	activity	plans.
