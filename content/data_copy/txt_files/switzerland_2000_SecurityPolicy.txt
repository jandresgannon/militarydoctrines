###### Summary

#### Our new security policy ...

###### The Report 2000 on Security Policy analyses the changed situation, describes the objectives of Swiss security policy and derives from them our strategy: security through cooperation. This strategy determines, in turn, the missions of our security policy instruments.


###### The new situation

The international situation has changed
fundamentally over the last decade. The
conventional military threat to Switzerland
has decreased. At the same time, the range
of other dangers and risks has expanded
considerably. Today’s security problems
cut across borders. The current crises and
conflicts in Europe confront many countries with the same challenges and they
have a direct impact on Switzerland as
well. The crises cannot be solved but by
a joint effort. For this reason, greater
security cooperation is imperative.

###### Our previous strategy

The previous Swiss strategy of security
policy aimed at security through autonomy. To a large extent it was based on
worst-case assumptions (nuclear war) as
criteria for the allocation of resources, and
it was accepted that a heavy time burden
was placed on the militia. This orientation
was appropriate to the circumstances of
the Cold War but the changed situation
calls for a new strategy.

###### 4 Security through Cooperation


###### The new strategy: security through cooperation

_The new strategy of Swiss security_
_policy is geared to cooperation._
Within Switzerland, emphasis is put on
the best possible coordination of our own
civilian and military instruments through
comprehensive and flexible security
cooperation. Internationally, cooperation
with friendly states and international
security organizations will be expanded,
as well as Switzerland’s commitment to
enhancing peace. Such a commitment
reflects our own interests; it reduces the
risk that Switzerland itself is affected by
the consequences of instability and war.
The strategy of cooperation runs like a
thread through all areas relating to security
policy. The path to greater security involves
more cooperation.


###### Part of the framework: neutrality

The law of neutrality leaves considerable
freedom for manoeuvre to the neutral
state. In the current political-military
environment neutrality must be interpreted in an active way which expresses
a spirit of solidarity. Neutrality does not
prevent Switzerland from an active
commitment to peace support or from
cooperation in military training. However,
the law of neutrality does prohibit giving
military support to any warring party. For
this reason, even in peacetime a neutral
state cannot make any commitment to
give military assistance in a war. Therefore,
membership in NATO is not compatible
with neutrality.


-----

#### ... and its consequences

###### The new strategy will have an effect on our security policy instruments, in particular on the armed forces and civil protection. The strategy calls for a reassessment of the relative importance of the missions of our armed forces. It also calls for a partial review of our compulsory service and will have an impact on our strategic leadership.


###### Reassessment of the missions of our armed forces

The new strategy demands that the
previous three missions of the armed
forces are evaluated anew.

_Peace support and crisis management:_
Compared to the former ‘peace promotion’
mission, the armed forces must expand
their engagement in the trouble area itself.
If necessary, it will also be possible to arm
voluntary units for their protection and
the success of their mission.

_Area protection and defence:_
Compared to the former defence mission,
cooperation with other armed forces will
be increased, particularly in training.

_Prevention and management of_
_existential dangers:_
Compared to its previous civil affairs
support mission, the armed forces must
be able to conduct several such operations
simultaneously after a short period of
preparation.

_Preconditions for accomplishing armed_
_forces missions:_
Altogether the armed forces must be able
to fulfil all three missions. Therefore, they
must be multi-functional. The armed forces
need graduated degrees of readiness.
High readiness is necessary for some
missions, but not for all. In view of a
potential threat increase, the armed forces
must also be able to increase their assets


accordingly. In order to cooperate better
with other armed forces (e.g. in peace
support operations), it will also be
necessary to improve interoperability.

###### Compulsory service

The militia system and compulsory service
for both armed forces and civil protection
will be maintained. However, flexibility
must be increased. Thus, the possibility
of doing this service within a single period
will be introduced for certain functions.
Another objective is earlier discharge from
compulsory service. Moreover, citizens
having fulfilled their military duty will no
longer be obliged to serve in civil protection. Finally, three variants for the future
assignment of personnel to the armed
forces and to civil protection have been
submitted for discussion.

###### Civil protection

Civil protection includes various civilian
means (e.g. fire brigades, civil defence,
rescue services) to protect the population
in the event of catastrophes, military
threats or other emergencies. The responsibility lies with the cantons and
municipalities. The federal authorities


assist in emergencies of national magnitude. Civil protection is primarily geared
to coping with disasters. Preparations for
unlikely events (e.g. nuclear war) have
become less important.

###### Strategic leadership

The strategic leadership of the Federal
Council will be strengthened. A newly
created Security Steering Group will
permanently assess the situation, identify
risks and opportunities as early as
possible and propose measures to the
Federal Council. The Security Steering
Group will also be charged with the
efficient coordination of our security policy
instruments with a view to comprehensive
and flexible security cooperation. At the
same time, coordination of the intelligence
services will be improved.

###### Fundamentals

#### New world ...

###### In the contemporary world, borders and geographic distances are declining in importance. More and more problems are becoming common problems – and successful solutions are also increasingly common solutions.

 The end of this century is, however, characterized not only by greater unity, but also by disintegration and fragmentation. This is obvious from the map of Europe and the crises and conflicts in the Balkans and Eastern Europe. This has far-reaching consequences for Switzerland, most obviously in terms of refugees seeking asylum in our country, but also in terms of a greater humanitarian responsibility.

_humanitarian assistance (airlift with Super Puma helicopters)._

#### ... new dangers

###### There is a broad spectrum of dangers and risks. The intensity and integration of non-military dangers has increased.


The most important dangers and risks
include:
uncontrolled proliferation of means of
mass destruction
exertion of economic pressure
vulnerability of modern information and
communications systems (cf. box)
terrorism, violence-prone extremism and
organized crime
the great disparity of prosperity, the
scarcity of natural resources and uncontrolled migration


natural and technological disasters

These dangers and risks increasingly
threaten the structures of modern and
open societies.


_ORGANIZED CRIME: Security forces at the German-Polish border fighting_
_against organized crime from Eastern Europe._

_PROLIFERATION: An Iraqi Scud missile is destroyed under UN direction. One of_
_the greatest dangers lies in the proliferation of long-range weapon systems_
_and of means of mass destruction._


_TERRORISM: A bomb attack on the_
_U.S. Embassy in Nairobi caused the_
_death of 240._

###### The threat to the information infrastructure

_Modern societies depend heavily on_
_the undisturbed functioning of in-_
_formation systems. These are vul-_
_nerable. Attacks on these systems and_
_networks can be waged by state and_
_non-state actors, with limited means_
_and regardless of distance. The risk of_
_detection is small. The range of pos-_
_sible attacks includes manipulating_
_data, introducing malfunctions, de-_
_stroying data, software, hardware and_
_infrastructure. Motives for such attacks_
_include (economic) espionage, black-_
_mail and influencing certain decisions7 7_
_in economy and administration._

#### Armed conflicts ...

###### Non-military threats, and violence below the threshold of war, have greatly increased, but they have not replaced war. Today war has two faces: It is either being conducted with the most modern means from the air or with conventional arms at close quarters on the ground. These two faces were evident in the Persian Gulf and on the Balkans.

#### ... and their management

###### International security structures have been designed for peace support, crisis prevention and conflict resolution. These tasks must increasingly be assumed jointly by the international community.

Conflicts should be resolved as peacefully
as possible, preferably by negotiation.
Pressure can be exerted with sanctions.
As extreme options, the international
community can threaten and apply force.
Whether political efforts to resolve the
problem succeed depends heavily on the
credibility of such threats. The decisive
prerequisite for resolving a conflict is the
political will to act. This will must always
be negotiated anew in the various international organizations. In principle, the use
of force without a mandate of the UN
Security Council is against international law.

###### Fundamentals

#### Our response: security ...

###### The security policy of Switzerland

 Our security policy serves to protect our country, population and interests against strategic dangers, i.e. the threat or use of direct or indirect force affecting considerable parts of country and population. ––

 1. Objectives 2. Strategy


###### Our security policy objectives derive from the Federal Constitution (Article 2) and our interests:

 we wish to make our own decisions, both domestically and in our foreign relations, without being affected by the threat or use of direct or indirect force we wish to protect our population and its infrastructure against existential dangers we wish to contribute to stability and peace beyond our borders and to building an international community of common values. Thereby we reduce the risk that Switzerland and its popula- tion will be affected by instability and war abroad. This is also an expression of our international solidarity


###### In a world of common values, prob- lems and the necessity for joint solutions, a strategy of cooperation is required. Our strategy of security through cooperation relates to two levels:

 cooperation between our own security policy instruments, especially for missions within Switzerland (‘com- prehensive and flexible security co- operation’) and international cooperation in security policy

 Characteristics of the new strategy:
 orientation according to the current and most probable dangers flexible and modular use of our security policy instruments within Switzerland intensification of international co- operation in peace support, crisis management and training Our own security policy instruments must be kept up to date.

###### Multi-functionality

 Multi-functionality means that the armed forces are geared to mastering several and different missions. The armed forces will be multi-functional as a whole. However, the individual soldier will not have to be able to do all the different tasks at the same time.

 Theory and practice correspond with each other


The importance of multi-functionality is
becoming increasingly evident in practice.
For example, the armed forces simultaneously fulfilled various missions in
different places in 1999: caring for people
seeking asylum, rescue, assistance and
supply missions for people affected by
avalanches, fighting floods, protecting
foreign missions and international organizations in Bern, Geneva and Zurich, giving


support to the border guard corps,
protecting Swiss diplomatic missions
abroad, and providing disaster relief to
our neighbouring countries. Armed forces
have been deployed to Bosnia and Herzegovina as well as to Albania for peace
support operations. Planning and conducting these missions is particularly
demanding in the case of a militia system
(availability of forces, predetermined duty


periods, reserves). Here too, the importance of cooperation is evident: Armed
forces perform together with civilian
executive staffs, civil defence, police, fire
brigades and other organizations. Their
success depends on cooperation.

###### Readiness and force generation capability

 The current security-policy situation calls for the armed forces to have graduated degrees of readiness.

Warning times for the defence mission are long today.
However, for peace support and coping with existential
dangers, greater readiness is necessary than in the past.
Parts of the armed forces must be rapidly available, after a
short period of preparation. Due to their force generation
capability, the armed forces continue to be prepared for a
relapse into politico-military conflicts. This implies that
personnel size, length of service, equipment and training
can be increased adequately and in time to cope with a
given situation. A timely political decision is necessary to
make use of this growth potential.

_Leopard II battle tank_

###### Equipment and training

 The armed forces’ equipment and training are continuously being modernized.

At least for parts of the armed forces, it is necessary to procure weapon systems and
other equipment which meet highest European standards. The necessary industrial
expertise for maintenance, upgrading and partially also for production must be
maintained.

###### Interoperability

 Interoperability includes all capabilities necessary for cooperating with foreign armed forces.


This includes language, staff procedures, equipment and training. Interoperability
facilitates cooperation in peace support, crisis management and in preventing and
mastering existential dangers. This in itself does not entail joining a military alliance.
The Swiss Armed Forces enhance their interoperability through joint exercises in the
Partnership for Peace programme and through experiences made in genuine
engagements.

###### Our security policy instruments

#### Civil protection

###### Civil protection is a civilian instrument for management, protection and assistance during disasters, politico-military threats and other emergencies.

All civilian resources for coping with disasters, armed conflicts and other emergencies
are being coordinated within the framework of civil protection. In principle, the
cantons are responsible for civil protection. The federal authorities provide the legal basis and support the cantons, e.g. in training. For events of national magnitude,
the federal authorities assume leadership and coordinate.

_Civil protection: coordinated cooperation of all partners for dealing with disasters._

###### Reorientation and adaptation of readiness


###### The security policy situation calls for a reorientation of civil protection and enables it to adapt its readiness.

‘Worst case scenarios’ (e.g. nuclear war)
have become rather improbable today.
Natural and technological disasters and
other emergencies have become much


more likely. This has consequences for
the readiness of civil protection: The main
emphasis for mission planning and
training will be on coping with disasters.
Civil protection will rely mainly on the
partly professional assets designed for
every-day activities. They will include, e.g.
fire brigades, medical rescue services and
technical facilities. The assets of civil
defence will be integrated into civil
protection. The civil protection assets will
be designed in a modular fashion, so that
modules can be employed selectively as


needed. Civil authorities will assume
leadership and coordinate.
The responsibility for civil protection will
lie primarily with the municipalities,
regions and cantons. It is also they who
are usually confronted with the task of
coping with disasters.
The federal authorities will assist the
cantons if the size of the emergency calls
for management and coordination at national level. The armed forces will be
engaged when the civilian resources are
exhausted.


###### The mission of civil protection in security policy

Civil protection will serve to alert the population and protect them against disasters
and politico-military threats. It will provide for the protection of vital facilities and
cultural assets. Incidents will be mastered by employing the modular means of cantons,
municipalities and private organizations.

contributing to strengthening and lastingly safeguarding peace, to conflict prevention
and crisis management
enhancing respect for human rights and basic liberties
safeguarding Swiss interests in arms control and disarmament negotiations
promoting compliance with humanitarian international law
assisting less developed countries and Eastern European states by raising their
living standards
providing humanitarian assistance in the event of disasters or armed conflicts
pursuing a policy of neutrality which allows Switzerland to participate actively in
the establishment of effective security structures

###### Peace support in concrete terms

Through concrete contributions Switzerland supports efforts of the UN and the OSCE
in peace support, preventive diplomacy and crisis management. Switzerland provides
election observers and experts, contributes to the build-up of democratic structures
and provides material and logistic assistance.
Switzerland also supports the protection of minorities, the freedom of the press, the
strengthening of local administration and an efficient justice and police who respect
the rule of law.

###### Human rights policy

Observance of human rights is an essential concern of Swiss foreign policy. Compliance
with the provisions of human rights is in our own security interest. In the long term,
peace and security can only be guaranteed if the community of states respect human rights and basic liberties, and political power is under democratic control.

#### ... economic policy

###### Switzerland has a long-standing vital interest in an open and liberal global economic trade system. Swiss economic policy relies heavily on cooperation for realizing our national interests.

 The security policy mission of economic policy


Swiss economic policy promotes the Swiss
economy and ensures its competitiveness.
It contributes thereby to prosperity and
stability in Switzerland. Swiss economic
policy supports an open global trade
beneficial to all partners – and hence is
also conducive to reducing economic
disparities which are in themselves an
important source of security problems.
Swiss economic policy must also be able


to cope with efforts to exert economic
pressure on Switzerland. This is facilitated
by our presence and ability to safeguard
our interests in international organizations
(e.g. the World Trade Organization). Swiss
economic policy also seeks to maintain
the ecological balance.

###### Our security policy instruments
#### Police and protection of the constitutional order

###### Internal security has become more important to the citizens than external security. However, the distinction between internal and external security is increasingly an artificial one: Dangers to internal security are becoming more and more related to events abroad. Therefore, international security cooperation is necessary for internal security too. Internal security is a security policy issue insofar as it involves the fight against grave strategic dangers. Such is the case if the security of considerable parts of country and population is threatened.

 The security policy mission of police and protection of the constitutional order


The majority of the police are subject to
the cantons. The police fight against
crime and ensure public security, law
and order. Operations are led by federal
authorities if the cantons lack sufficient
resources to cope with the events. The
_protection of the constitutional order_


helps to safeguard the democratic infrastructure, the rule of law and the
rights and liberties of the population.
It serves to identify dangers linked to
violence at an early stage and prevent
terrorism, extremism, espionage, weapons proliferation and organized crime.


At the federal level, protection of the
constitutional order supports the police
and cantonal judicial authorities.


###### International cooperation

Dangers and risks are becoming increasingly international. This is also true for internal security. Therefore, the
fight against violence, terrorism and organized crime must
also be internationalized and coordinated. Security through
cooperation applies here too.
With the agreements of Schengen and Dublin, the EU has
developed two effective instruments. They define controls
at the external borders of the Union and a uniform procedure
for granting asylum. These agreements help establish a
European area of security. As non-member of the EU and
the European Economic Area, Switzerland cannot join these
agreements. As far as possible, Switzerland strives to
compensate for this disadvantage by concluding bilateral
agreements, in particular with its neighbours.

_Organized crime such as international drug trafficking can_
_only be fought through international cooperation._

###### Assistance by the armed forces


If the resources of the civil authorities are
no longer capable of maintaining security
and public order, they can request
assistance by the armed forces. Such
armed forces engagements are always
subsidiary: The responsibility for the

###### 22 Security through Cooperation


operations rests with the civil authorities.
Assistance by the armed forces consists
mainly in protection, logistics, and transport. Forces employed in such operations
must be adequately equipped and trained.


-----

###### Information and communications

 Direct communication by the responsible authorities has political significance.

As a consequence of the information revolution, the influence state authorities
have on information is diminishing. This has the advantage that undemocratic
governments find it increasingly difficult to deny their population access to correct
information. Conversely it has also become easier to disseminate false and
misleading information.

###### Information and communications infrastructure

The information and communications
infrastructure of Switzerland is exposed to many risks, not only in crisis
situations but permanently. In principle, each member of the information
society is responsible for the security
of his or her means of information and
communications. But because of the

###### The framework of our security policy

#### Resources: militia ...

###### The citizens of Switzerland pay the price for security in the form of money (taxes) and time (compulsory service).

Security policy must ensure a reasonable relation between expenditure and results.
Financial resources must be allotted in such a way that our security policy satisfies
the requirements and is as efficient as possible.

###### The militia armed forces


Several European states have
recently abolished compulsory military service for professional armed forces. However, in Switzerland national
circumstances and requirements continue to favour the
militia system. It is firmly anchored in the citizens’ minds.
Switzerland will therefore maintain its
militia armed forces. The militia system
also has cost advantages, in comparison
with professional armed forces. Moreover,
it strengthens the link between armed
forces and the population, and is an ex
###### Finances

Security policy and its instruments must
be given sufficient resources. Although
the availability of financial resources does
have an influence on security policy, this
must not be allowed to become the determining factor. Security policy requirements must be defined on the basis of

pression of the citizens’ direct responsibility for the state.
At the same time an increasing number
of service personnel experience the limits
of the militia system when they have to
reconcile the demands of profession,
family and compulsory service. The armed
forces themselves also realize that the
militia system gives rise to problems in
certain areas. These relate primarily to
the need for a high degree of operational
readiness. If the armed forces have to
conduct several missions simultaneously,
the availability of manpower quickly
reaches its limits with the present militia

As far as absolutely necessary the professional component will be increased,
especially for the areas of peace support,
advanced technology and training.

#### ... and compulsory service

###### The current organization of the compulsory service place a heavy burden on the militia. Despite this, the availability of the armed forces is very limited in peacetime. Improvements are necessary.

The militia system, universal conscription and compulsory civil protection service will be maintained, but their organization
and duration will be adapted to the security-policy situation. Optimization measures will be taken in the context of the reform
options presented below. These adaptations do not require a constitutional amendment. However, if compulsory duties were
to be modified fundamentally, the Federal Constitution would require amendment. Three models (pp 26-27) indicate possible
reforms in compulsory service.

###### Elements for a reform of compulsory military service

_The elements of reform aim at reducing the length of time during which a citizen_
_is liable to serve in the armed forces. This would match the requirements of_
_society and the economy better than the present system does._
These elements would also result in a greater readiness for some parts of the armed
forces. This is necessary for both domestic operations (area protection, prevention
and management of existential dangers) and for voluntary operations abroad
(humanitarian assistance, disaster relief, peace support). These adaptations could
be realized without a constitutional amendment.

###### The framework of our security policy

#### Resources: modification ...

###### The threat situation permits a reduction in personnel strength of the armed forces and of civil protection. This reduction can be realized by lowering the age of discharge from compulsory service.


However, concrete numbers for personnel
strength can only be identified on the basis
of the forthcoming guidelines for the
armed forces and civil protection. Three
variants for the future assignment of
persons liable to serve to the armed forces
and civil protection will be examined.

###### Model A

At conscription, citizens unfit for military
service for health reasons would, as in
the past, be assigned to civil protection
(if not altogether dispensed from compulsory service). All citizens fit for military
service would have to do basic military
training (recruit school). Subsequently
some of them would, however, be assigned to civil protection service. If necessary,
transfer from the armed forces to civil
protection would also be possible at a
later stage, as long as not all the compulsory service days have been fulfilled.

_International changes called for new responses._


The neutrality policy of Switzerland was
never something immutable. The policy
Switzerland practised was always in
keeping with the international situation.
Obviously, the scope of our neutrality policy was very limited during World War II.
Surrounded by the Third Reich, Switzerland mainly emphasized its independence.
The situation after World War II allowed
for a more active engagement in the spirit
of solidarity. Switzerland made use of
these opportunities, for example by taking
part in peace-keeping operations or in the


Partnership for Peace programme.
That Switzerland sovereignly used its
security policy scope, was evident already
in 1919. At that time the Swiss Government – with the consent of all governments
concerned – sent armed military escorts
to Eastern Europe. These escorts were
assigned to protect the transport of goods
from the Swiss textile industry.

###### The framework of our security policy

#### Strategic leadership

###### The activities of numerous instruments – situated in various federal departments and at different levels – must be coordinated to ensure our security: Strategic leadership is necessary. The newly created Security Steering Group assists the Federal Council in this task.

The Security Steering Group is a staff of the Federal Council.
It includes as permanent members the top officials of the
federal departments responsible for security affairs. If
necessary, non-permanent members from cantons and
scientific experts will be integrated. The Steering Group will
contribute to an early identification and improved management
of major security problems. It will monitor the situation and
its possible evolution. It will identify dangers and risks, but
also opportunities to counter them as early as possible, and
work out what the options are and what measures should be
taken. Another important task of the Steering Group will be
applying comprehensive and flexible security cooperation to
our own security policy instruments.

also the Federal Council – receives the relevant information
in time, so that it can effectively assume strategic leadership.

#### The way ahead: milestones of our new security policy

###### Security policy is not just a matter for the armed forces and civil protection. Our security policy instruments include foreign policy, economic policy, national economic supply, police, protection of the constitutional order and information. However, armed forces and civil protection are the instruments with the greatest need for reform. The Report 2000 on Security Policy provides the basis for these reforms. The projects for reforming the armed forces and civil protection are currently in the planning stage. Respective guidelines will be presented in the year 2000. Implemen- tation of reforms is planned for 2003.

 August 1996 Federal Councillor Adolf Ogi tasks the ‘Study Commission on Strategic Issues’ with the definition of Switzerland’s current position in security policy. February 1998 The report of the ‘Study Commission on Strategic Issues’ is published. September 1998 The Federal Council defines political guidelines for the elaboration of the new report on Swiss security policy.

 June 1999 The new report on Swiss security policy is published. It is the strategic basis for reforming the armed forces and civil protection. It is submitted to Parliament for attention.
