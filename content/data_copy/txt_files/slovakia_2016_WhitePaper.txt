## Foreword by the Minister of Defence of the Slovak Republic

In response to the worsening situation in the area of national defence the Slovak
Government released a document named White Paper on Defence of the Slovak Republic in 2013
as the main politico-strategic product of the Strategic Defence Review. For the first time in a
long while, this document projected the long-term development of ensuring national defence
up to the year 2024. Life brings change, however, and to a greater or lesser degree this change can
influence our intentions and their materialisation. This document is a case in point.
Developments in Ukraine in 2014 presented a fundamental change in the security
environment in Europe, which steadily grew worse after the destabilisation of the Greater
Middle East and a concomitant growth of security risks for the Slovak Republic and her Allies.
The era of a stable security environment with low risks in the external environment, considered
as a matter of course by some, is over. Security threats have become more real and directly
influence the security interests of the Slovak Republic. Measures undertaken in reaction to this
not only in Slovakia but also at the level of NATO and the EU have not undermined the validity
of the key tenets of the _White Paper on Defence of the Slovak Republic from 2013. They did_
influence its implementation, however, especially in the area of armament. Steps taken in the
past were enough to halt the decline of our armed forces but not enough to overcome all serious
shortfalls.
This called for a review of the current situation and the need to determine the right
course of further national defence development until 2030, while taking into account not only
probable developments in the security environment, but the resources available as well. The
result of this review is the new White Paper on Defence of the Slovak Republic. The clear and
urgent imperative of this document is the need to strengthen the ability of the Slovak Republic,
in all its complexities, to defend itself, especially focusing on increasing the readiness and warfighting ability of the Armed Forces of the Slovak Republic.
The White Paper on Defence of the Slovak Republic stresses the fact that the Slovak Republic
is primarily responsible for its own defence. It highlights the need to prepare for all scenarios,
not excluding the most dire of scenarios in the form of a direct attack on the Slovak Republic.
This calls for developing the individual and collective capacity to resist armed attack.
The document in front of you contains a set of measures pertaining to key areas of ensuring
national defence. These take into account tasks resulting from the common efforts in NATO,
especially measures strengthening collective defence.
Improving national defence management, especially in war-time, is a key measure
requiring improvements in intelligence, decision-making processes, planning, preparing state
authorities for national defence and other areas.
Increasing readiness and the war-fighting ability of the Armed Forces of the Slovak
Republic is built on two key areas of their transformation. First, human resources are the most


-----

valuable asset we have and therefore emphasis is laid on increasing the moral qualities, level
of education and expertise of professional soldiers. The second pillar is composed of military
hardware, the most expensive segment of capability development, while its replacement or
modernisation is key to progress in transforming the Armed Forces of the Slovak Republic.
As threats to national security are more tangible, a greater emphasis on heavier hardware with
greater fire-power, manoeuvrability and ballistic protection is in demand. The development of
infrastructure utilised by the Armed Forces of the Slovak Republic will respond to the poor
condition of several of its elements, including its educational and training base.
At the same time, the White Paper emphasises the importance of support given to the
Armed Forces of the Slovak Republic by other elements of the system of national defence in case
of an armed confrontation, as well as of the host nation support given to allied forces while they
operate on Slovak territory.
The most important means of implementing development aims will be a functioning
defence planning process bridging strategic aims, programming priorities and budgetary
considerations with the acquisition process.
Last but not least, this important document emphasises the need to strengthen the trust
of the public in national defence, to deepen patriotism and the defence-awareness of citizens
in the spirit of national and military traditions, as well as the need to increase the quality of
preparation of the general population for national defence.
My life-long experiences in the armed forces have confirmed me in my opinion that
ensuring national defence is conditional on fulfilling its long-term needs, which in turn requires
continuity of approach and solutions with a guarantee of funding across several electoral terms.
This was one of the reasons why we submitted the draft of this White Paper to a wide public
discussion before the official release by the Government. The opportunity to express their opinion
within the scope of this discussion was therefore open not only to government institutions
but also to members of the appropriate parliamentary committee, several former ministers of
defence, former state secretaries of the ministry of defence, former Chiefs of the General Staff
of the Armed Forces of the Slovak Republic, representatives of the non-governmental sector
including professional interest groups, representatives of selected union organisations, the
Slovak Security and Defence Industry Association and last but not least, the general public.
After all, national defence is not leftist or rightist, it does not exclusively concern either the
governing coalition or the opposition, nor is it the responsibility of the state or professional
soldiers and employees of the MoD only. As stated in the Constitution of the Slovak Republic,
defence of the Slovak Republic is a duty and a question of honour of its citizens. I hope that in
this way a deepened sense of shared responsibility for its implementation has been achieved.
It is especially important because the _White Paper on Defence of the Slovak Republic_
constitutes a strategic vision and a comprehensive point of departure for enhancing the ability
of the Slovak Republic to defend itself. This document will be followed by further decisions,
including the adoption of a long-term Armed Forces development plan, a new Defence Strategy
_of the Slovak Republic, a conceptual framework of how to develop the system of national defence_
and last but not least, armament projects for the Armed Forces. In all these cases we seek political
and public support.
In closing, I would like to express my thanks to all who took part in drafting this
document including the external expert community and to all who will actively contribute to its
implementation.

## Foreword by the Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Slovak Republic

As an independent state the Slovak Republic fulfils its functions in many areas. An
important part of statehood is the ability of a state to secure its sovereignty, territorial integrity
and, last but not least, the security and protection of its citizens. By joining NATO, undoubtedly
the most important international security structure, we took upon ourselves the commitment
to contribute to stability and security in the international environment but at the same time the
commitment to maintain and develop capabilities ensuring our own security and the ability to
defend ourselves.
Many factors, which are currently undergoing fundamental changes, influence the
character and the level to which tasks are fulfilled by the Armed Forces of the Slovak Republic.
This fact calls for a re-evaluation of the basis and aims of military capability development of the
Armed Forces of the Slovak Republic necessary for ensuring national defence.
In 2013 a _White Paper on Defence of the Slovak Republic was released, which defined_
the long-term development framework for the armed forces including proposals on how to
insure its funding. Changes in external factors, especially the recent fundamental change of the
security environment, as well as military and non-military threats and risks have led us to the
re-evaluation of aims and means of achieving them.
The aim of this White Paper on Defence of the Slovak Republic is to provide a politicostrategic framework for the long-term development of ensuring national defence, concentrating
on the Armed Forces of the Slovak Republic, while maintaining the status of a trustworthy and
equal partner enjoyed by Slovakia within the EU and NATO.
The need to enhance the ability of the Slovak Republic to defend itself, an increase in the
number of tasks for the Armed Forces and the fulfilment of international obligations require a
higher standard of our military capabilities. Our Armed Forces will need to have not only an
enhanced war-fighting potential, more effective combat support and combat service support,
but also higher readiness – for both collective defence and crisis management.
Part of the updated White Paper on Defence of the Slovak Republic is an Armed Forces
development concept and a strategy of how to implement it by 2030. This concept lays out the
force structure and the capabilities of the Armed Forces necessary to ensure the defence of the
Slovak Republic, as well as to fulfil its international obligations. In my view the decisive criterion
of the development of the Armed Forces is the modernisation of military hardware and the
replacement of outdated equipment and other materiel of tactical units.
In spite of the recently increased efforts to modernise the Armed Forces and enhance their
training, it has not been possible to completely halt the declining trend of both the quality of
capabilities and of the ability of the Armed Forces to perform tasks to the extent required. This
state of affairs considerably effects the ability of the Armed Forces to perform tasks in the state of


-----

security and at the same time lessens their ability to flexibly perform tasks particularly related to
the preparation for their mission, the ability to perform tasks related to Slovakia’s commitments
in NATO and the EU, but also concerning operations and missions abroad. For these reasons
our efforts in the upcoming years will be focused on maintaining and perhaps enhancing the
capabilities of the Armed Forces, along with gradually improving their overall readiness. The
expected end-state are well equipped and well trained Armed Forces with enhanced capabilities
and interoperability with allied forces.
Maintaining combat capabilities and overall battle-worthiness of the Armed Forces, and
also their ability to perform set tasks without fundamental shortfalls and limitations will require
a conceptual approach to capability development. This will require the drafting of a long-term
Armed Forces development plan, as well as adopting effective measures for the preparation and
implementation of development projects of major military equipment.
The requirements of operational readiness and interoperability of the Armed Forces with
allied forces demand comprehensive training – both national and international. That is why,
besides outfitting the Armed Forces with modern equipment living up to current standards,
I consider ensuring high quality training as especially important in order to improve combat
capabilities, as well as to forward the overall transformation of the Armed Forces. In the
upcoming years we will continue with the intensity and improvement of training focusing on
collective defence of Slovak territory according to Art. 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty.
As the Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Slovak Republic I believe that
the intentions of this document will have a considerable influence on capability development of
the Armed Forces. For this to happen, it is necessary for these intentions to be transformed into
tangible deeds, which must not only have the support of the political leadership, but a sufficient
allocation of resources. If this occurs, this document will be a relevant basis for the drafting and
implementation of strategic and planning documents of the Armed Forces development, which
will in the end bring about the achievement of the set aim of increasing the responsiveness and
the war-fighting ability of our Armed Forces.

## Executive Summary

Key results of the implementation of the White Paper on Defence of the Slovak Republic

The _White Paper on Defence of the Slovak Republic_ (2013) evaluated the condition of
national defence in a comprehensive manner and provided a politico-strategic framework of its
long-term development, the gradual implementation of which was begun. The implementation
of this document was influenced by a fundamental change in the security environment and by
corresponding measures taken at the national level, as well as at the NATO and the EU levels.
In this context the key results of its implementation are as follows:

- the process of updating the strategic and conceptual framework of national defence has

begun,

- the level of defence spending in real terms as well as in relation to the national GDP has

been stabilised and started to grow, decisions have been taken to manage allocated

resources more effectively,

- conditions have been created to retain highly qualified military personnel and to foster

the long-term sustainability of the specialised social welfare system of professional soldiers,

the nominal military personnel strength of the Armed Forces of the Slovak Republic

(AF SR) has been increased along with the actual number of professional soldiers,

- the largest Air Force armament projects in the history of independent Slovakia have been

launched, the effects of which will be seen in the coming years,

- the spectrum of capabilities of the AF SR has been maintained, the overall level of their

interoperability according to NATO standards has not changed significantly.
These and other measures have prevented the loss of some capabilities and created the
conditions for a reboot of the AF SR transformation process. The level of providing national
defence remains, however, under the negative sway of:

- the condition of national defence management,

- a marked long-term imbalance between tasks and allocated resources,

- the ineffectiveness of the defence planning system and a lack of interconnectedness of

strategic aims, programming priorities, budget and procurement,

- a lower level of readiness of the AF SR, particularly as a result of
   - under-manning of AF SR units,

   - restrictions on AF SR training,

   - the fact that most major military equipment is obsolete, have a low level of

serviceability and parameters unfit for both the modern battlefield and for

interoperability with allied forces,

- a lag in AF SR capability development,

- AF SR stockpile deficits,

- the bad technical condition and obsolescence of infrastructure managed by the Ministry

of Defence of the Slovak Republic (MoD).

Key measures

- increasing the ability to defend the Slovak Republic:

   - consistently live-up to the responsibilities of the Slovak Republic concerning its

defence,

   - deepen the synergy of individual and collective capacity to resist armed attack,


-----

   - a gradual increase of defence spending in keeping with the needs of defending the

Slovak Republic and commitments towards Allies,

   - apportion at least 20% of defence spending on major equipment, including related

research and development,

   - enhance the defence planning system,

   - intensify communication with the public concerning national defence,

   - create conditions conducive to improving the preparedness of the general

population for national defence,

   - deepen the comprehensive approach to national defence including the development

of capacities to support the operations of the AF SR in defence of the Slovak

Republic, as well as Host Nation Support capacities of the Slovak Republic,

   - support the involvement of the Slovak defence industry in providing equipment

and other materiel for the AF SR, and promote its products abroad;

- improvement of national defence management:

   - increase preparedness of state authorities to organise and ensure national defence,

   - improvement of intelligence, the early warning system and situational awareness,

   - introduction of comprehensive planning of national defence,

   - harmonising functional ties of the national crisis response system measures and

NATO Crisis Response System measures, as well as enhancing the compatibility of

systems for transmitting classified information;

- enhanced readiness of the AF SR:

   - a gradual enhancement of the capabilities of the AF SR in the context of their

transformation;

   - ensuring a balanced development of the AF SR – Land Forces, the Air Force and

Special Operations Forces,

   - enhancing the capacities of combat units, units for combat support and combat

service support,

   - improving equipment and other materiel, including communication and

information systems,

   - achieving and maintaining full operational capability of a mechanised brigade,

   - increase in readiness and capabilities of forces also employable in counter-terrorist

operations,

   - increase the manning levels of AF SR units,

   - increase the moral qualities, as well as the level of education and expertise of

professional soldiers to perform tasks connected with the defence of the Slovak

Republic and the defence of Allies,

   - increase the intensity of training focusing on defending the Slovak Republic and

her Allies,

   - improve the command and control systems in the AF SR,

   - a gradual increase in the stockpiles necessary to perform tasks connected with

national defence,

   - development of infrastructure managed by the MoD according to set priorities,

including the development of the educational and training base.

Achieving the development aims depends upon the size of the Slovak defence budget
and the effectiveness of Slovak defence spending.

## The Evolution of the Military Arts in Slovakia Through History

The Slovak Republic in the context of European history has been in existence as an
independent, sovereign state only briefly. The history of the Slovak nation, however, goes back
further than that, all the way to the early Middle Ages. The population of the territory of what
is today Slovakia has since then repeatedly struggled, often up in arms, for either their survival,
freedom or statehood.

National and military traditions of Slovakia

For centuries, Slovakia had been part of multinational states and Slovak soldiers served
and fought in the armies of these states, many of them gaining widespread recognition either as
commanders or ordinary soldiers, leaving a permanent imprint on European military history.[1]

The first truly Slovak national military units were formed during the revolutionary years
of 1848 - 1849. The Slovak volunteer corps organised by the Slovak National Council as the
national revolutionary authority fought until the end of the revolution in the autumn of 1849,
when they were dissolved. Their military traditions remain permanently in the minds of the
Slovak population and Slovak soldiers proudly harked back to them in all other struggles for
national freedom and equality.

The idea of restoring a Slovak volunteer army, which would be involved in the struggle
for national liberation, independence and equality, was raised for the second time during World
War I by Milan Rastislav Štefánik. Later, a combined force was organised upon the emergence
of a joint Czecho-Slovak resistance movement in order to jointly gain national freedom for
Slovaks and Czechs.

Czecho-Slovak troops abroad (later called the Czechoslovak Legions) began to be
organised in the years 1914 - 1915 on the territory of Russia and France. The most numerous were
the legions in Italy; they were formed just before the end of the war and played a role especially
in October - November of 1918. These legions contributed to the victory of the Entente, but
mainly helped the domestic and foreign resistance movement of Slovaks and Czechs in creating
and gaining international recognition of the Czecho-Slovak state.

The Czecho-Slovak state (the Czechoslovak Republic), which was established on the 28
October 1918, built its army mainly from members of the Czechoslovak Legions. The army was
prepared for territorial defence and by European standards was very well equipped and trained.

1) E.g. Field Marshal Andrej Hadik, a descendant of a small Slovak noble family, as commander of a Habsburg
hussar regiment took Berlin during the Seven Years’ War in 1757 and permanently left an imprint on military
history by this “escapade”. Later on, he held the office of the President of the Court War Council in the Habsburg
Monarchy, which can be compared to the current Minister of Defence (War). Similarly, Ladislav Škultéty-Gábriš,
the Habsburg soldier of the 18th and 19th century, is considered the longest-serving soldier of all time, as he
served 81 years in the army.


-----

On Hitler’s insistence the Slovak state was established on the 14 March 1939 (named
the Slovak Republic after July of 1939); its army organisation was subsequently formed on the
basis of the Czechoslovak Army located in Slovakia. The Officer Corps was formed mainly from
drafted reserve officers, especially teachers, which contributed to the fact that the armed forces
had not become the backbone of the regime. During their deployment on the Eastern Front in
the years 1941 - 1943, Slovak soldiers first individually, and then in whole groups defected to
the Allied side of the front where they primarily enlisted with the Czecho-Slovak foreign army
fighting on the side of the Allies.

The gradually growing anti-Hitler mood among the officers led to the preparation of
the armed anti-fascist rising of the Slovak Army in the Slovak National Uprising. The armed
resistance began on 29 August 1944 when German troops tried to seize control of the territory
of the Slovak Republic. The Slovak rebel army managed to fight for two months in the open,
yet it did not surrender even after that time. Some units endured in guerrilla fighting until the
arrival of the front at the turn of 1944 - 1945, some until liberation in April - May of 1945. The
armed uprising of the Slovak soldiers and partisans of 29 August 1944 was one of the largest and
longest analogous military risings against Nazi Germany in Europe.

Many anti-fascist-minded Slovaks in World War II also took part in the Allied struggle
to defeat Nazi Germany as part of the foreign Czecho-Slovak resistance. Thousands of Slovaks
fought together with Czechs in battles of the Western Front: in the Battle of Britain, in the
Middle East, as well as in the fighting on the Eastern Front in the Union of Soviet Socialist
Republics. The Czechoslovak Republic was restored at the end of the war as an achievement of
their struggles.

The new armed forces were built primarily on the basis of foreign troops, particularly the
1[st] Czechoslovak Army Corps in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. After the communist
coup in 1948, the armed forces became an instrument of power of the communist regime, and
since 1955, one of the Warsaw Pact armies. The development of the Army, the education and
training of its members met the principles and requirements of Soviet political and military
doctrines.

The end of the Cold War at the turn of 1989 - 1990 also meant a call for the transformation
of the armed forces to the conditions of a democratic polity in a new security environment. This
was reflected not only in the creation of new military-strategic principles of the development
and employment of the armed forces, but also in promoting the gradual democratic changes in
the management of the army and also the process of humanising military service.

These important historical events and milestones, especially those related to the fight of
Slovaks for national freedom against national oppression, for the European ideals of humanism,
egalitarianism and equality, against fascism and war, and also the fight for peace and democracy
form the basis of military and martial traditions of Slovakia.

Forming the Army of the Independent Slovak Republic

On 1 January 1993, a peaceful split of the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic into two
independent states took place in parallel with the division of the federal army and the formation of


-----

the Army of the Slovak Republic, from which the AF SR were created by gradual transformation
by 1 July 2002.

The formation of new, fully-fledged Armed Forces of a sovereign state required a
transformation from the offensively-minded mass army with a predominance of heavy military
equipment into such Armed Forces that are smaller, modern, well-trained and which, in addition
to defending the Slovak Republic, would also fulfil international commitments, including
participation in operations and missions abroad. A decisive factor in the evolution of the security
and defence policy of the Slovak Republic was the fact that the political decision makers were in
favour of its Euro-Atlantic orientation.

In the period between 1993 and 1997, the first politico-strategic documents of the
Slovak republic in the realm of defence were adopted _(The Defence Doctrine of the Slovak_
_Republic in 1994, The Fundamental Objectives and Principles of National Security of the Slovak_
_Republic in 1996). They suited the times both in character and content. The fact that the Slovak_
Republic was not invited to NATO in the first round of enlargement had a significantly negative
impact on the overall reform efforts, which at the end of the 90s resulted in a lower readiness
levels of the Army of the Slovak Republic.

The period from 1998 until 2003 saw qualitative changes in the security and defence
policy of the Slovak Republic related to the intensification of integration efforts and the
subsequent invitation of the Slovak Republic to negotiations on its accession to NATO. For the
first time in the history of the Slovak Republic, standard strategic documents were approved in
2001 (The Security Strategy of the Slovak Republic, The Defence Strategy of the Slovak Republic,
and The Military Strategy of the Slovak Republic) which defined the objectives and tasks of the
security and defence policy of a democratic state aspiring to join NATO and the EU.

Subsequently in 2002, the Long-Term Plan of the Structure and Development of the Armed
_Forces of the Slovak Republic - the Development Plan and Programs, Including Their Financial_
_Demands (Model 2010) was adopted. Although it still focused on the individual and territorial_
defence of the Slovak Republic, it created space for integration with NATO. For the first
time, the necessary long-term resource framework of the MoD was defined and guaranteed by
resolutions of both the Government and the National Council of the Slovak Republic, which
did not, however, materialise.

During this period, related legislation that formed the basis for change in the approach to
defence capacities development planning, including the Armed Forces in the context of EuroAtlantic integration, was also adopted. In March 2003, as a pre-condition of NATO accession,
the Slovak Government approved the _Implementation Timetable of Reforms which defined_
individual reform steps and guaranteed the commitment of the Government of the Slovak
Republic to allocate the necessary resources for defence.

2) By 30 June 2002, the Armed Forces consisted of three separate elements - the Army of the Slovak Republic, the
Troops of the Ministry of Interior and the Railway Troops. From 1 July 2002, the Army of the Slovak Republic
was officially renamed as the AF SR (consisted of the Land Forces of the AF SR, the Air Force of the AF SR and
the Training and Support Forces of the AF SR) with the Railway Troops and the Troops of the Ministry of
Interior dissolved as of 31 December 2002. The Training and Support Forces of the AF SR were dissolved as of
30 November 2014, with their elements amalgamated with other parts of the AF SR.


-----

In the period between 2004 and 2008, the defence efforts of the Slovak Republic were
dominated by tasks relating to NATO and EU membership. In 2005, new strategic documents
were approved _(The Security Strategy of the Slovak Republic_ and The Defence Strategy of the
_Slovak Republic) which were fully compatible with the strategic documents of the EU and_
NATO and defined the new nature of the defence of the Slovak Republic in the framework
of collective defence, formulating requirements arising from the transition from territorial
defence to defending interests. These documents together with the adoption and amendments
to relevant legislation created a corresponding strategic and legal framework concerning the
defence of the Slovak Republic as part of collective defence and the meeting of other NATO and
EU commitments.

In 2005, a new conceptual document, the Long-Term Development Plan of the Ministry
_of Defence Until 2015 (Model 2015), which placed emphasis on building expeditionary forces_
while at the same time, in contrast to Model 2010, predicting a lower level of defence spending,
was approved. Its implementation has also not materialised. Transformation was therefore
carried out by emphasising peace-time tasks of the AF SR, which led to a deterioration of their
capacities and capabilities to carry out war-time tasks. The implementation of plans lagged
behind as well, which was negatively reflected particularly in the process of modernising major
military equipment. On 1 January 2006, the AF SR became fully professional with conscription
legally retained.

Since 2009, the unfavourable situation in the Armed Forces has been amplified by the
effects of the economic crisis on defence spending, the level of which received a significant
downward trend. At the same time, the growing demand for capabilities development and a
gradual shift in proportion from their participation in missions and operations abroad in
favour of NATO-led operations brought with it increased demands on human, material, but in
particular financial resources. It was confirmed that organisational changes in the AF SR aimed
at lowering numbers of personnel, which was the key characteristic of their transformation since
1993, do not achieve the desired effect, i.e. use of saved funds for the acquisition of equipment
and other materiel, including communication and information systems.

The slowdown in the transformation of the Armed Forces began to gradually limit the
carrying out of their basic tasks. The urgent need to define new parameters for the long-term
development of ensuring national defence with an emphasis on the projection of the future
development of the Armed Forces, while responding primarily to the reduced levels of defence
spending, resulted in the initiation of the Strategic Defence Review process in the second half
of 2010.

Drafting of its key outputs was delayed by the fall of the Government in the autumn
of 2011 and did not result in the adoption of fundamental documents in that election term.
For this reason, the lack of a realistic framework of long-term development of the AF SR with
suitable budgetary backing that existed since 2007 (the year when Model 2015 was abandoned)
persisted. This in turn delayed systemic solutions with implications for the ability of the Slovak
Republic to defend itself. After the early parliamentary elections of 2012 the new Government
of the Slovak Republic continued with the Strategic Defence Review process and released the
_White Paper on Defence of the Slovak Republic in 2013._

## Implementation of the White Paper on Defence of the Slovak Republic (2013)

### 1.1 Introductory context


1) The White Paper on Defence of the Slovak Republic (2013), being the
main output of the Strategic Defence Review process, provided a politicostrategic framework of long-term development of ensuring national defence.
This has been absent for several years. The White Paper also laid the foundation
for a systematic and coordinated approach to national defence development
in the upcoming years.

2) The rise of instability in the east and south of EU borders resulting
from armed conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, including the
increased threats of terrorism and mass migration worsened the security
environment in Europe with global implications. Threats have become more
real and dangerous, whilst the probability of their materialising has become
relative and the reaction-time required for adequate decision-making has
been diminished.


3) In reaction to the worsened security environment various measures
had been undertaken: a number of operative measures at the national
level in order to maintain national security and to minimise security risks;
measures undertaken at the NATO level aimed at enhancing its readiness
and responsiveness and measures undertaken at the EU level, including
sanctions and the revision of the strategic framework of the EU’s Common
Foreign and Security Policy. The change of the security environment, being
of a fundamental and long-term nature, demands a comprehensive, systemic
and equally long-term response in the area of national defence.

### 1.2 Meeting The Defence Policy’s Main Aim


4) According to the _Defence Strategy of the Slovak Republic_ (2005),
Slovakia considered the main aim of its defence policy to be the security of


-----

its citizens and ensuring national defence, by utilising both national defence
capacities as well as opportunities provided by collective defence, along
with an active participation in building peace and global stability, conflict
prevention, crisis resolution and in confidence building.

5) The main aim of defence policy of the Slovak Republic was met
despite the changing security environment, with higher risks arising,
however, from both the condition of national defence capacities, as well as
AF SR interoperability levels with allied forces in the context of long-term
development deficits from the past. The process of meeting this aim was
therefore focused on halting negative trends as regards AF SR capabilities by
implementing measures set out in the White Paper on Defence of the Slovak
_Republic (2013)._

### 1.3 The Defence Efforts of the Slovak Republic

6) The basis and axioms of the _White Paper on Defence of the Slovak_
_Republic (2013) are of a long-term character. The fundamental change of the_
security environment in Europe and the worsened security situation in her
neighbourhood highlighted the need for an enhanced defence effort of the
Slovak Republic.

7) By setting aims and providing a strategy of how to proceed in enhancing
the ability of Slovakia to defend itself, the _White Paper on Defence of the_
_Slovak Republic (2013) provided conditions for effective resource allocation,_
which in turn was a pre-requisite for positive changes in the resource backing
of national defence.

8) Despite a rigorous consolidation of public finances, planning
assumptions concerning the evolution of defence spending as set out in
the White Paper on Defence of the Slovak Republic (2013) were honoured.
This was achieved by stabilising defence spending as a percentage of GDP
beginning in 2013 (circa 1%), increasing defence spending in real terms
beginning in 2014 and increasing it as a percentage of GDP (circa 1.1%)
beginning in 2015. Decisions of the Government concerning investments
into modernisation supported the rise of defence spending. As regards
defence spending levels, there persisted an imbalance in the set tasks and
resources allocated for their execution.

9) A number of measures have been undertaken by the MoD in order to
better utilise resources, especially in the area of infrastructure (for example:
the centralisation of immovable assets management and the reduction of
costs through the MoD relinquishing infrastructure) and the operation of
joint stock companies (entry of a strategic partner into companies, mergers

of companies and rationalisation of structures), as well as measures to
increase the effectiveness of procurement (for example the use of electronic
auctioning/electronic marketplace, use of services provided by NATO
agencies to procure certain commodities). The MoD to a greater extent drew
on foreign military aid and EU funding.

10) The conceptual framework of optimising defence planning system
(processes) was not satisfactorily implemented. Primarily due to the lack of
a long-term plan and due to decisions made in the area of investing in major
military equipment brought on by changes in the security environment, a
disjointed relationship was created between strategic aims, programming
priorities and budgetary priorities with procurement.

### 1.4 Defence Management, the MoD and its Ancillary Elements

11) In keeping with measures set out in the White Paper on Defence of the
_Slovak Republic (2013), the process of reviewing and updating the Defence_
_Strategy of the Slovak Republic (2005) had begun. In connection with this,_
the preparation of the System of National Defence Development Concept, as the
basis of enhancing the quality of this system and particularly its managerial
element had also begun. This process was influenced by the fundamental
change of the security environment and the decision of the Government to
prepare these documents in succession to the Security Strategy of the Slovak
_Republic. Findings from this process were utilised in drafting legislation. A_
set of situational plans for utilising the AF SR in crisis situations and the
internal framework of crisis management at the MoD were updated.

12) Demands on streamlining MoD activities were only partially met
within the framework of rationalising the administrative structure of the
MoD and its ancillary agencies and facilities. Basic systemic conditions for
enhancing the ability to perform tasks by the MoD were created, especially in
the area of national defence management and human resources development.
Developments in the security environment highlighted the need to enhance
the readiness of the MoD to perform tasks in war-time, which only confirms
that the optimisation of its administrative structure is incomplete.

13) Semi-budgetary organisations, most of the budgetary organisations
and the state-owned company managed by the MoD were, in the context
of the needs of national defence, retained and they implemented measures
to streamline operations. The Military Police was also reorganised, while
its direct subordination to the Minister of Defence has not been altered.
The merger of the Military Intelligence Service and the Military Defence
Intelligence into Military Intelligence made its management and resource
allocation in information gathering more efficient.


-----

14) The entry of a strategic partner by a long-term lease of property into
two defence industry joint stock companies managed by the MoD and
the merger of these companies into the _Aircraft Repair Company Trenčín_
_JSC advanced its economic stability, while other measures supported the_
innovation of its production program. By taking over the management of
the state-owned DMD GROUP JSC, the MoD created conditions necessary
for the development of its military equipment production and maintenance,
especially of artillery platforms and those necessary for enhancing the quality
of state property management in this regard. Merging three joint stock
companies, managed by the MoD, that provided recreational and health
services, into one – HOREZZA JSC, and streamlining its structure enhanced
its economic performance and made investment into the quality of provided
services possible.

### 1.5 Long-Term Projections of Armed Forces Development (Capability Development)

15) Measures of the White Paper on Defence of the Slovak Republic (2013)
planned for the end of 2015 were taken according to available resources. The
spectrum of AF SR capabilities was maintained, flat reductions in the number
of professional soldiers were stayed and inexpensive organisational changes
were carried out in the AF SR structures along with the strengthening of
combat elements to the prejudice of command and support elements. The
optimisation of logistic functionality was not completed in a comprehensive
manner. The intent in the area of reviewing military doctrines, including the
revision the AF SR Doctrine (C), remains unachieved.

16) The enhancement of the intensity of AF SR training was begun,
including live fire exercises and exercises with allied forces focusing, especially
in the Land Forces, on defending the Slovak Republic. Joint preparation and
involvement of the AF SR in exercises with key elements of the Integrated
Rescue System was intensified. AF SR training remained significantly
curtailed, however.

17) The drop in the manning levels of AF SR units has been halted (in
2015 manning was at circa 83.5%) by increasing the number of professional
soldiers resulting from higher recruitment and lower rates of leaving the
service, despite an increase in the AF SR nominal number strength in
connection with creating units in line with the AF SR model (for example
a motorised battalion, an Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and
Reconnaissance battalion - ISTAR). Shortfalls in specialised positions and
an increase in the average age of professional soldiers persist.

development

legislation concerning the

18) In connection with the changes in the security environment and
following the decisions of the Government, the progression of AF SR
armament projects has been altered in favour of air force equipment. By
approving the AF SR Air Force Development Concept (2014) the Government
gave direction to air force development.

19) As a result of the changed progression of armament projects, as well
as financial constraints, the former priority intent of outfitting a battalion
with multirole tactical vehicles, and other equipment and materiel remains
unachieved. Enhancing the combat potential of armoured vehicles already
in use was begun (the modernisation of Infantry Fighting Vehicles).
Despite advances in building a mobile communication system (MOKYS)
for a mechanised battalion group, the desired end-state of the command,
control, communication, computers and intelligence system (C4I) with an
appropriate security certificate was not achieved.

20) In the context of achieved results as regards the implementation
of development intentions, as well as in view of long-term development
deficits, the obsolescence of major military equipment, materiel shortfalls,
communication and information systems limits and in military personnel
preparedness shortfalls persist. These are the reasons why the AF SR are
markedly lagging behind in both capability development and in meeting
NATO interoperability standards – against the 2015 standards, their levels
were at about 50% of measureable indicators.

### 1.6 Human Resources Development in the scope of the MoD

21) New legislation concerning the military service of professional
soldiers created conditions to retain highly qualified military personnel at
the operational and strategic levels in the AF SR command structure and
introduced a short term form of military service to meet AF SR manning
needs. Since this legislation was passed at the end of 2015, its positive
contribution has not yet been felt. Preconditions for the long-term
sustainability of the specialised social welfare system of professional soldiers
have been created by the amendment of legislation dealing with the social
welfare of policemen and soldiers.

22) In order to increase the quality of military preparation of personnel,
the military character of education provided by the AF SR Academy of
Milan Rastislav Štefánik was strengthened and other measures focusing on
specific areas of expertise were adopted, including the possibility of attending
a civilian university.


-----

23) By adjusting legislation, conditions were created to enhance the
effectiveness of AF SR active reserves, preparations for tasks connected with
national defence and other emergencies. New legislation introduced a new
source of personnel for AF SR reserves in the form of voluntary military
training for citizens. Training of active reserves has not as yet been carried
out.

24) Care for families of professional soldiers sent to perform tasks
abroad has been conceptually elaborated, along with the creation of a new
military specialisation – a social services and consulting expert, whose task
it is, amongst others, to develop social work and carry out methodological
guidance in the area of providing care for the families of professional soldiers.
A concept of caring for war veterans has also been elaborated.

25) A separate concept for the personnel management of MoD employees
has not been drafted. Measures of the White Paper on Defence of the Slovak
_Republic (2013) in the area of improving and replenishing civilian personnel_
were implemented according to legislation concerning the civil service,
focusing on education.

### 1.7 Armament

26) The fundamental change of the security environment followed by
EU sanctions placed on the Russian Federation, along with the condition
of AF SR hardware, influenced not only the conceptual designs of AF SR
development, but also the course of their armament aimed at reducing the
technological dependence of the AF SR on the Russian Federation, which
led to preferential investment into the Air Force.

27) An era of the largest investment projects in the history of the Slovak
Republic was begun – the purchase of transport aircraft and multirole
helicopters approved by the Government and other major projects were
considered – the replacement of radar equipment and ensuring that Slovakia
has a multirole tactical airplane capability (fighter aircraft). A 4x4 multirole
tactical vehicle project has also been prepared. Both the projects that are
under way and those that are being prepared constitute a breakthrough in AF
SR rearmament. The practical repercussions of these changes will, however,
be felt in 2018 - 2019 and later, after this equipment is delivered.

28) Delivered to the AF SR were primarily automotive equipment and
different categories of light weapons for infantry and materiel for Special
Operations Forces (SOF). Three L-410 light transport aircraft were
replaced.

29) The modernisation that was undertaken did not dispose of the longterm shortfalls pointed out in the _White Paper on Defence of the Slovak_

_Republic_ (2013) and manifested themselves as shortfalls in parts of and
obsolescence in most equipment, materiel, including communication and
information systems (the life span of much of the major military equipment
has expired). These factors do not permit the achievement of AF SR
capabilities required for national defence and most of this kind of equipment
is faulty and unserviceable.

30) Based on the evaluation of the potential for modernisation or the
replacement of military hardware, the modernisation of Infantry Fighting
Vehicles was begun. This brings with it not only enhanced tactical and
technical parameters but also considerable support to the Slovak defence
industry by including it in this modernisation. Services of NATO agencies
(the procurement of small all-terrain vehicles and ammunition) and direct
inter-governmental cooperation were utilised to a greater extent in arms
procurement.

### 1.8 State Property Management and Infrastructure at the MoD

31) The extent of property managed by the MoD gradually decreased as a
result of changes in the organisation of the AF SR and the stationing of their
units and the placement of facilities. Maintenance costs were reduced by a
more effective management of immovable property and by more frequently
utilising employees rather than outsourcing tasks.

32) Only a limited number of infrastructure development projects were
launched. These focused on priorities like the specialised Training Center

- Lešť and smaller projects in the area of airport infrastructure, fuel storage,
facility security (handling of classified information) and the quality of
life of personnel, as well as projects connected with meeting international
commitments. Chosen projects were co-financed with the NATO Security
Investment Programme (NSIP). In the context of set priorities and budgetary
considerations, projects dealing with energy efficiency remained in the
preparatory phase. No changes occurred in the condition of central and
garrison training facilities.

33) Budgetary constraints limited infrastructure maintenance as well.
Most facilities managed by the MoD are in a bad technical condition,
are outmoded and expensive to maintain. Some facilities are in a state of
disrepair which limits their use and poses a danger especially to the natural
environment.


-----

### 1.9 The National Defence Support System

34) The long-term development of national defence support
(infrastructure, services and activities provided for the purposes of national
defence) was updated. Its development remained limited by a low level of
financing, leading to the postponement of task completion and some plans
not being launched. The utility of several defence infrastructure compounds
remained limited by their technical condition.

35) The absence of a conceptual approach in the area of national defence
support did not allow for the preparation and implementation of systemic
measures to adjust it to the changed security environment, while at the
same time that changed environment makes it even more important. It was
decided that a NATO Force Integration Unit (NFIU) should be created on
the territory of the Slovak Republic, the activities of which will also help inter
alia the preparation and implementation of measures aimed at enhancing
the abilities of the Slovak Republic to provide Host Nation Support (HNS)
to allied forces in the event of them being stationed in or operating on its
territory (including transit).

### 1.10 The Focus of Public Communication and Public Relations

36) Communication on the part of the MoD was focused on meeting
international obligations and accomplishing tasks by the AF SR during nonmilitary emergencies on Slovak territory. The involvement of the AF SR in
preparing citizens for national defence was enhanced by amending legislation.
However, this preparation as part of the educational process in primary and
secondary schools was still focused on life and health protection in times of
emergencies.

37) Initiatives of the White Paper on Defence of the Slovak Republic (2013)
in communicating with non-departmental domestic target groups, including
the third sector, have not materialised. This resulted in a lessened public
understanding of Slovak defence needs and of some measures taken by the
MoD, a largely negative attitude of the media and a similarly critical approach
towards the MoD by the non-governmental expert community.

38) Communication concerning national defence lacked strategy making
it underdeveloped, ineffectual and largely reactive. All this in an era when
the information channels in the Slovak Republic are being filled by domestic
extremist groups and foreign actors spreading their message and propaganda
aimed against the security interests of the Slovak Republic.

### 1.11 Conclusions

39) The contribution of the White Paper on Defence of the Slovak Republic
(2013) to providing a clear picture of the condition of national defence and
a long-term politico-strategic framework of national defence development,
with a focus on the AF SR, was confirmed. Its implementation was influenced
primarily by the fundamental change in the security environment and such
measures aimed at minimising security risks as were necessitated by this
change.

40) Although identified by the White Paper on Defence of the Slovak Republic
(2013) and in spite of progress made in solving problems arising from the
AF SR transformation process, shortfalls remain. These shortfalls, which
were impossible to correct since 2013 and have the potential of persisting in
the mid-term, are primarily found in the capacities and capabilities of the AF
SR, resulting from long-term budgetary restraints and ineffective resource
management. These particularly include:

- low manning levels of the AF SR in the state of security (the “state of

security” as stated in national constitutional legislation*), particularly

of units in lower readiness levels, influencing their ability to become

operationally ready,

- insufficient numbers and obsolescence of equipment and other

materiel, including communication and information systems, along

with a lessened serviceability of some equipment,

- restrictions on the scope and quality of training, especially tactical

training at the battalion and brigade levels, and also the achieved

number of flight hours,

- supplies available for combat operations are at a critically low level,

- the quality of AF SR capabilities and their level of interoperability

with allied forces are low.

- State of security - a state in which the following are maintained: peace and security of the
State, its democratic system and sovereignty, its territorial integrity and inviolability of its
borders, fundamental rights and freedoms. It is also a state in which the lives and
wellbeing of individuals, property and the natural environment are protected.


-----

41) This White Paper on Defence of the Slovak Republic (2016) defines the
course for further ensuring national defence until 2030, closely linking this
course to the measures aimed at reducing shortfalls taken in 2013-2015 and
the fundamental change in the security environment.

## The External Security Environment of the Slovak Republic

42) The framework of the global security environment is undergoing
dynamic change and will continue to be characterised by geopolitical and
geo-economical changes, along with new asymmetries in power and wealth
distribution.


43) The security environment of the Slovak Republic is and will
continue to be greatly influenced (positively and negatively) primarily by
globalisation and its accompanying changes in the international state of
affairs. The perpetuation of open globalisation processes will remain as one
of the sources of serious security problems in geopolitical, geo-economical,
ecological, raw material and social matters. In the long-term they may have
an unpredictable, synergic and cumulative effect. They will continue to go
hand in hand with conflicts, crises and new hotbeds of tension.

44) Unconventional domains and spaces (informational, electromagnetic,
cybernetic, cosmic and nano-technological) will be drawn towards
the centre of gravity of military activities, depending on the speed of
technological advance of specific security actors. Cyberspace has become
a new operational domain of conducting combat activity. An attack
carried out in cyberspace may escalate to the extent of invoking Art 5 of
the _North Atlantic Treaty and may lead to collective defence, or rather a_
coordinated response of NATO member states. Tying into this is the fact
that the development of weapon systems for unconventional domains and
spaces is not at present fully limited by the existing system of political and
legal arrangements in the area of arms control, which poses a serious security
problem.


A partial return to
developing the combat
potential of modern,
technologically
sophisticated armed
forces of a conventional
type


45) In the case of some actors, the possibility of partially returning to
developing the combat potential of modern, technologically sophisticated
armed forces of a conventional type in the mid-term is likely (this concerns
primarily hardware for the ground forces, the Special Operations Forces,
precision weapon systems, hypersonic weapon systems, missiles with
horizontal flight, means of electronic warfare, cybernetic weapons and
missile defence assets). Also, one of the leading trends in combat activity is
the utilisation of unmanned aerial vehicles and electronic warfare assets.


-----

46) Nuclear powers will continue to utilise the potential of strategic
nuclear forces’ capabilities and functions. It is not possible to exclude the
possibility of a new nuclear power emerging in the mid-term. Globally, the
potential and capabilities of strategic nuclear forces will be one of the main
sources of tensions.

47) The possibility of utilising low yield nuclear munitions at the tactical
or the operational-tactical level, the ability to adjust their effects (third
generation nuclear weapons), the utilisation of multiple independent re-entry
vehicles and the enhanced mobility of nuclear weapon systems (including
their platforms) are the main trends in the area of the military utilisation
of nuclear forces, besides that of deterrence and containment by strategic
nuclear forces (this function will probably be retained).

48) It is impossible to dismiss the likelihood that, in connection with the
dynamics of change of the global security environment, it will be imperative
to transform one of the pillars of international security – the international
system of arms control and disarmament. This will primarily involve
the system of treaties regarding regulations and the control of arms and
disarmament in the area of conventional and unconventional weapons,
cyberspace and outer space.

49) There will be attempts, in the area of arms control and disarmament,
to not only bind by treaty the largest number of actors possible, but also
to counter such attempts. Their essence will be the abandonment or the
non-involvement of particular actors in specific areas of armament and
disarmament covered by the existing system. These processes have the
potential of reactivating the spiral of an arms race of global proportions.

50) Questions of transforming the system of arms control and disarmament
is closely linked with other pillars of international security. In this context
the key questions concern mainly key subjects of international law (for
example the right of nations to self-determination vs. the territorial integrity
of a state) and issues related to justifying the very existence of systems of
common defence and collective security. The security architecture of
Europe is undergoing change and revision. This is the result of the system
of international law, as applied so far, being questioned, as well as of the
developments taking place in bilateral relations of the Russian Federation
with Ukraine on the one hand, and with NATO and the EU on the other.
These aspects will, to a large extent, influence the security of the Slovak
Republic.

51) How the situation in the eastern neighbourhood of NATO and the
EU develops will have a decisive impact on the security environment of the
Slovak Republic and her Allies. The current security situation in the eastern
parts of Ukraine will probably lead to an additional frozen conflict. Its
existence will create potential sources of tensions, which will also influence
the security situation throughout Ukraine with a possible spill-over to the
security of the Slovak Republic.

-----

Strategic-level
propaganda along
with “hybrid means
of conducting combat
operations” represent
a major security threat


52) Ukraine will probably continue in its efforts to intensify its military
cooperation with NATO which is one of the deciding factors in the worsening
of its relations with the Russian Federation. A large-scale conventional
armed conflict between Ukraine and the Russian Federation is unlikely,
but it is not possible to dismiss this scenario completely. The security
situation can change rapidly. In the case of a larger conflict it is important to
primarily keep in mind the extant problem of the internally displaced persons
in Ukraine, the number of which could grow rapidly. In the event that the
security situation of Ukraine worsens further, the migration potential of
Ukraine may multiply with deleterious effects on the security architectures
of neighbouring countries.

53) Ukraine will continue to be dependent on the political and financial
support of the EU and the International Monetary Fund. Improvement
of Ukraine’s economic situation is not likely in the near to mid-term. The
political situation in the country remains unstable. The strengthening of
these factors may lead to social unrest among the populace.

54) The revised _Military Doctrine of the Russian Federation_ explicitly
declares its defensive character, but the actual politics and the security
realities may change. This doctrine emphasises that nuclear weapons will be
used only in reaction to an attack on the Russian Federation by nuclear or
conventional means and its very existence is threatened. A security problem
in this context arises mainly from their reserving the right of a pre-emptive
nuclear attack at the operational and tactical levels.

55) Strategic-level propaganda along with specific operational methods
which are today called “hybrid means of conducting combat operations”
represent a major security threat from the point of view of conducting
conflicts in a changing security environment. Propaganda at the strategic
level is a part of exerting informational and psychological influence
on chosen target groups of the society within the framework of the so
called “information warfare”. Propaganda at the strategic level is one of
the pillars of a concept called “permanent war”. The basic tenets of this
concept may be utilised in future conflicts of different types by all manner
of security actors (also non-state), not only by the security forces of states.
The aim is to break, with a minimal use of conventional forces, the moral and
psychological strength of the adversary’s armed forces and particularly of a
part of his civilian population (the polarisation of target groups) in such a
way as to strike at the values and assets of the opponent targeted by “hybrid
warfare”.

56) Sources of potential threats of both a military and non-military
character will continue to be caused by the uneven economic, social and
demographic development of individual nations, states, regions and
continents. In the end, differences also create favourable conditions for the
activities of terrorist, radical, extremist and militant groups.


-----

57) Organised terrorism will persist as a serious global security threat of
an asymmetric character, supported also by certain authoritarian regimes.
Terrorism applies and will continue to apply an indirect strategy, the essence
of which is to avoid direct confrontation with states. It will aim its attacks
at selected sensitive and unprepared segments of a society, for example mass
gatherings of people permitting maximum effect as regards the infliction
of losses and influencing the moods of a society, undermining the belief
of citizens in the ability of the state to ensure their security. Even the most
modern arms and weapon systems are ineffective against such attacks.

58) New terrorist groups that are creating and will continue to create
new potential areas of instability are gaining ground on the international
scene. Many of them accept the ideology of AL-QAIDA, while others, like
the Islamic State are more radical than AL-QAIDA.

59) A rise of different forms of terrorist activity may be expected in the
Horn of Africa, Sahel, Maghreb and Levant regions, along with the Persian
Gulf states. This rise cannot be excluded from south-east Asia and some areas
of the western and south-western Balkans.

60) The threat of terrorism increases exponentially with technological
advances. This development may, in the end, create new forms of individual
terrorism (for example a genetically engineered plague and computer viruses,
lone wolves, individuals returning from conflict areas, migrants).

61) The balance of power between actors (both state and non-state)
may be decisively altered by weapons of mass destruction arsenals in their
possession and may necessitate a change of military strategy and tactics. The
rising number of actors attempting to possess weapons of mass destruction
by achieving the technological wherewithal to produce them or simply
by buying them is, along with their trafficking, a serious security threat to
global security. The threat of misusing readily available biological
substances will remain.

62) Future conflicts will probably not be of a large-scale character on a
large territory with massive involvement of human and material resources,
but of a more local, regional character.

63) The Middle East will continue to be a source of instability. The main
destabilising factors will be: territorial disputes, the expansion of terrorism in
conjunction with religious extremism, social and economic stagnation and
degradation, migration, energy shortfalls, water shortage and resulting food
shortages, population growth, spread of conventional and unconventional
weapons.

64) In the long-term perspective, it is not possible to dismiss the
possibility of subdued military and non-military security threats, localised
in current and potential zones of tension in the Eurasian crisis crescent to
the South and East of Slovakia, escalating into generated local conflicts of


The Middle East will

Military and

threats


a military and non-military character. Conflicts of this kind could, under
certain conditions in a radically changing security environment, escalate
into regional proportions. Negative phenomena connected with migration
processes pose specific security problems in the above context. One of the
consequences of the worsening security situation in areas south of the Slovak
Republic may be a heightened migration wave from the southern migration
route (so called Libyan Road).

65) The security environment of the Slovak Republic will in the longterm be influenced by global military and non-military, symmetric and
asymmetric security threats, such as:

- terrorism and organised transnational terrorism,

- cybernetic attacks,

- exertion of informational and psychological influence on the

populace and hybrid warfare,

- use of weapons of mass destruction,

- illegal possession and spread of weapons of mass destruction, their

delivery systems and their manufacturing technology,

- rise of asymmetric conflicts (local and regional conflicts of a military

or non-military character),

- organised transnational crime allied with illegal arms and materiel

trafficking, production and sale of drugs and active participation in

illegal migration,

- rise of religious, left-wing and right-wing extremism,

- uncontrollable migration,

- deepening of differences between poor and wealthy states and

restrictions on access to natural resources, water and economic

products,

- shrinking of strategic sources of raw materials and food,

- persistence of the current crisis, or the crisis of the financial, or

perhaps of the monetary and economic systems.

66) The external security environment of the Slovak Republic will be
specifically influenced more by non-military and asymmetric threats than
those of a military and symmetric character. In the long-term perspective
we may assume these will increase, their spectrum will broaden and their
destructive power will be enhanced. It is impossible to dismiss the scenario
that some of them may progressively escalate into threats of a military
character.

## The Future Defence Efforts of the Slovak Republic


_Defence efforts of the Slovak Republic express the will and clear_
_determination of the State to maintain its defences. They reaffirm the_
_guarantees to the citizens of the Slovak Republic that national defence will be_
_assured and they express the guarantee to its Allies that the Slovak Republic_
_will honour its commitments. At the same time, it is a message to potential_
_adversaries about the credibility of the Slovak Republic in ensuring national_
_defence._
_The scope and character of defence efforts is determined by security_
_interests, aims and tasks of Slovak defence policy as stated in strategies, by_
_legislation, international commitments and by related political decisions_
_of decision-makers. These, in reaction to the scope and character of threats_
_posed to the Slovak Republic and her Allies, determine the specific aims and_
_measures of national defence, including the appropriate level of national_
_resources allocated to national defence and the ways in which they are_
_spent._

### 3.1 The Basis of Defence Efforts


Consistently meet the
national responsibility
for defence


67) The core of the defence efforts of the Slovak Republic will be to
ensure national defence as a basic condition of national existence and the
security of its citizens, by means of national defence capacities, collective
defence through NATO and tools provided by the Common Security and
Defence Policy of the EU. National defence, including the strengthening of
its defence capacities, are among the priorities of the Government.

68) The defence efforts of the Slovak Republic will be based on the national
responsibility for defence as enshrined in the constitutional framework
of the Slovak Republic. It states that „the defence of the Slovak Republic
is a duty and a question of honour of citizens”, while „the Government of
the Slovak Republic is responsible for national defence and security“. The
Slovak Republic will enhance its ability to defend itself by developing its
individual and collective capacity to resist armed attack, which will also
strengthen the defence potential of NATO and the military capabilities of
the EU.


-----

69) The defence efforts of the Slovak Republic reflect the long-term needs
of national defence, which go beyond the term of a single Government. The
continuity of dealing with key issues of national defence will be achieved
on the basis of a broad political agreement of the most influential political
parties.

70) The scope of the defence efforts is tied in with the level and stability
of defence spending and also the degree to which the security interests
of the Slovak Republic are threatened. Defence spending may be partially
negatively influenced, but not determined, either by external pressures
(economic crisis), or by internal factors (change of Government).

71) Defence efforts will be realised primarily as part of the development
of the system of national defence, itself being part of the system of national
security. The system of national defence will be able to take into account a
wide spectrum of threats and scenarios of how they may unfold, ranging from
terrorist threats to an armed attack by military means combining various
tools and methods within the format of sophisticated forms of conducting
combat operations utilising both standard and high-end technologies.

### 3.2 Slovak Defence Efforts in the Future Security Environment

72) The expected development of the security environment demands
that the defence efforts be geared towards enhancing preparedness of the
Slovak Republic for national defence as part of decreasing its vulnerability
and strengthening its overall resilience. In this context, the comprehensive
approach to national defence will also be enhanced, which will entail
_inter alia a more effective utilisation of the potential of the Slovak defence_
industry.

73) Due to the global or transnational character of most threats along
with the limitations of national defence capacities, the Slovak Republic will
approach most threats and challenges on the basis of a joint effort with
Allies and partners within international organisations, mainly NATO
and the EU. Similarly, the Slovak Republic will provide aid to Allies and
partners within the above mentioned international organisations. Slovakia
will support the internal cohesion and functionality of NATO and the EU,
as well as their ability to act and complement each other as regards tools and
activities.

74) Contractual guarantees of collective defence and mutual assistance
within international organisations do not exempt Slovakia from meeting
its natural responsibility of providing for its own defence by means of
its national defence capacities, as stated in its constitutional and legal


The defence efforts will be
geared towards enhancing
the preparedness
of the Slovak Republic
for national defence


-----

Maintain the ability
to generate defence
capacities for the most
dire threat scenario –
– an armed attack


frameworks. This is also confirmed by Art. 3 of the North Atlantic Treaty,
in accordance with which the Parties, separately and jointly, by means of
continuous and effective self-help and mutual aid, will maintain and develop
their individual and collective capacity to resist armed attack.

75) To responsibly approach national defence, it is required that adequate
defence capacities to solve most probable threat scenarios to the Slovak
Republic are continuously maintained, along with the ability to timely
generate defence capacities able to confront even the most dire threat
scenario – an armed attack against the Slovak Republic.

76) In line with its security interests, Slovakia will push for strengthening
collective defence and deterrence as part of NATO’s long term adaptation
to the fundamentally changed security environment. To this end, Slovakia’s
defence efforts will primarily contribute by AF SR capability development,
taking part in joint rapid reaction forces and by maintaining a high level of
preparedness of the HNS. Slovakia will also contribute its Armed Forces to
NATO-led missions and operations abroad. As part of fulfilling NATO’s
cooperative security task, Slovakia will coordinate with Allies its efforts to
boost arms control and disarmament, military transparency and confidence
building measures. It will also support the transformation of the armed forces
of candidate and partner nations including their training and also to support
the development of NATO’s partnerships, with an accent on its strategic
partnership with the EU.

77) Slovakia will contribute to the effectiveness and credibility of the
Common Security and Defence Policy of the EU, which also includes
contributing forces and AF SR resources to EU military missions and
operations, as well as to EU rapid reaction forces. In order to support the
development of EU partnerships with other international organisations and
states, Slovakia may provide a military contribution in the area of defence
capacity building of partners. At the same time, Slovakia will support
the effective cooperation of EU member states in military capability
development, especially as regards high-end capabilities.

78) In accordance with its security and foreign policy aims, as well as
international law, Slovakia will involve itself in UN missions.

79) Slovakia will participate in international defence cooperation within
NATO and the EU primarily with the other Visegrad Group countries,
with an aim to effectively mitigate capability shortfalls. This especially
concerns intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, cyber defence, air
policing cooperation, strategic transport, training, multinational logistical
support and other capabilities. Slovakia will maintain not only its leading
role in the NATO Explosive Ordnance Disposal Centre of Excellence based
on its territory, but also its partnership with Poland in leading the NATO
Counter-Intelligence Centre of Excellence based Poland.


-----

80) In keeping with its defence efforts, Slovakia is resolved to employ its
Armed Forces in national defence based on the natural right to individual or
collective self-defence in accordance with the UN Charter and principles of
international law, in keeping with its international commitments stemming
from the collective defence against armed attack treaty, the EU treaties and
other international commitments.

81) The AF SR must ready themselves to act in accordance with the
politico-military ambition of the Slovak Republic in a fundamentally
changed security environment, entailing a change of the anticipated
operational theatre of their future deployment, as well as the character of
conducting combat operations against different types of adversaries.

82) The operational theatre of future AF SR deployment and
employment will be differentiated geographically, environmentally,
politically, economically and culturally, while it may be characterised
by rapid and intensive military activity, high manoeuvrability of groups
involved, employment of traditional land, air and SOF capabilities with
an emphasis placed on their integrated and simultaneous deployment,
conducting of cybernetic and electronic warfare and the presence of high-end
technologies, including anti-access and area denial assets, unmanned aerial
vehicles, precision munitions and other (also standard) technologies. The
AF SR may also be employed in an operational theatre where no clear lines
exist either between the battle front and rear, or between combatants and
civilians. The AF SR may be called upon to take action against an adversary
fighting a conventional war, or a mixed conventional and unconventional
(asymmetrical) war in either different stages of a conflict or simultaneously
(hybrid conflict) on open ground, but also in cities, which may also involve
paramilitary forces. The AF SR may, however, also face an adversary that
employs exclusively irregular, asymmetrical tactics (long-term insurgency
activity) mainly in an urban environment.

83) In the event of defending the Slovak Republic, militarily favourable
conditions at the strategic, operational and tactical levels will be created,
based on prepared national capacities for AF SR support, primarily for
a rapid operational deployment and the effective operation of the AF SR.
During defensive operations on the territory of the Slovak Republic, other
elements of the system of national defence along with the mobilisation of
human and material capacities of the nation will support the AF SR, while
HNS will be provided for.

84) In the context of growing regional instability generating greater
threats to NATO member states, the territories of these states will be
considered the top priority as regards the operational theatre of future
AF SR deployment abroad (collective defence). It is expected that whilst
operating on the territory of an Ally, HNS capacities of that Ally will be
taken advantage of by the AF SR.

deployment abroad


-----

The new scope of the
national politico-military
ambition must, in
a comprehensive manner,
express the end-state
of AF SR capacities
and capabilities for
operational employment


85) The AF SR may also be deployed abroad in a region more or less
distant from the Euro-Atlantic area, especially as part of missions and
operations of international organisations to bolster international peace
and security. This may concern a culturally alien environment with
underdeveloped infrastructure, very limited or non-existent public services
and non-functioning administration, requiring comprehensive support of
units from home.

86) In addition to its main task, which is national defence, the AF SR must
be prepared to effectively respond to non-military threats on the territory
of the Slovak Republic. During certain types of non-military emergencies,
those AF SR units possessing life, health and property protection capabilities
will also be employed in conjunction with other elements of the system of
national security. AF SR capabilities can also be utilised in counter-terrorist
operations and to provide support in maintaining public order.

87) It is apparent that both the territory of the Slovak Republic and that
of her Allies represents a qualitatively different operational theatre of AF
SR deployment, anticipates a different adversary and a different conduct
of combat operations in contrast to past AF SR employment in peace,
stabilisation and reconstruction missions in regions more or less distant from
the Euro-Atlantic area. This requires placing emphasis on developing those
AF SR capabilities that can be utilised in defence of the Slovak Republic and
her Allies.

### 3.3 The Politico-Military Ambition

88) The politico-military ambition of the Slovak Republic expresses
the scope and purpose of AF SR employment.[3] The scope of the national
politico-military ambition must in a comprehensive manner express the endstate of AF SR capacities and capabilities (in the context of NATO Capability
Targets for Slovakia), which will be employed in:

- the defence of the Slovak Republic,

- meeting commitments of the Slovak Republic stemming from the

treaty on collective defence against attack (collective defence of a

NATO Ally),

- missions and operations abroad,

- non-military emergencies on the territory of the Slovak Republic.

89) A comprehensive politico-military ambition will more precisely express
national defence as a priority of Slovak defence efforts. It will also reaffirm
the quality, scope and level of operational readiness of Slovakia’s contribution
to NATO meeting its Level of Ambition, along with its contribution to

3) Article 27 of the Defence Strategy of the Slovak Republic (2005).


-----

missions and operations conducted as part of the EU’s Common Security
and Defence Policy. It will also take into account the mission of the AF SR as
regards non-military emergencies on the territory of the Slovak Republic.

90) The politico-military ambition of the Slovak Republic will take into
account:

- the anticipated evolution of the security environment, including

threats and challenges,

- the primarily national responsibility for the defence of the Slovak

Republic,

- the comprehensive approach to national defence,

- increasing qualitative demands on the system of national defence,

- commitments within NATO,

- tasks in the area of the EU’s Common Security and Defence Policy,

- other international commitments of the Slovak Republic,

- the AF SR mission in case of non-military emergencies on the territory

of the Slovak Republic.

91) Fulfilling the politico-military ambition will be provided for as a key
priority of national defence. Tasks primarily connected with defending the
Slovak Republic and meeting her commitments stemming from the treaty
on collective defence against armed attack will be paramount. These are tasks
that require a continuously high level of readiness and war-fighting ability
of the AF SR, while in the case of capability shortfalls connected with these
tasks, an acute risk arises that national defence may not be fully provided for.
The tasks in question are:

- defence and protection of national air space within the NATO

Integrated Air and Missile Defence System (“NATINAMDS”),

- maintaining critical capabilities necessary for national defence and

their systematic build-up with an emphasis on the capabilities of

a mechanised brigade and forces also employable in counter-terrorist

operations,

- maintaining a high-readiness mechanised battalion group and

contributing to NATO and EU rapid reaction forces,

- provide for mobilisation and HNS.

92) The politico-military ambition of the Slovak Republic will be defined
in a comprehensive manner in the new Defence Strategy of the Slovak Republic,
tying in with the Security Strategy of the Slovak Republic, both of which must
be approved by the National Council of the Slovak Republic.


-----

In order to enhance the
ability of the Slovak
Republic to defend itself
it is imperative to
provide adequate
defence spending


### 3.4 Planning Assumptions for Ensuring National Defence

93) The fundamental change of the security environment in Europe and
the worsening of the security situation in her neighbourhood require an
increased ability of the Slovak Republic to defend itself. The basic planning
assumption necessary for achieving future AF SR capabilities is the politicomilitary ambition of the Slovak Republic, in accordance with which and
depending on the situation, Slovak authorities may decide on employing the
AF SR on the following scales:

- in operations in defence of the Slovak Republic – full scale of

capacity,

- in collective defence operations in defence of an Ally in case of armed

attack – on a scale consistent with international commitments,

- in non-article 5 NATO led operations, and also missions and operations

of the EU and the UN - on a scale declared by the Slovak Republic,

- in case of non-military emergencies on the territory of the Slovak

Republic - on an adequate scale.
To these ends the AF SR will be divided according to readiness levels.

94) In order to enhance the ability of the Slovak Republic to defend itself
it is imperative to provide adequate defence spending primarily focused
on investing in major military equipment and in training. These are the
basic conditions that must be met in order to increase the quality of AF SR
capabilities, their war-fighting potential and their overall level of readiness
for national defence.

95) While respecting the important principle of fair burden sharing of
NATO efforts, including contributing to threat prevention and ensuring
security, the key indicator of which is the level of defence spending, Slovakia
will increase its share of this common effort in the context of the evolution
of the security environment and the possibilities of its national economy.

96) Slovakia reaffirms its political commitment to the Defence Investment
_Pledge (2014) agreed upon by NATO member states and accepted in the_
_NATO Political Guidance (2015). This commitment binds Slovakia to halt_
any decline in defence spending and aim to increase defence spending in
real terms as GDP grows and also to aim, within a decade, to move towards
the 2% of GDP guideline level of defence spending. This commitment also
entails the aim to increase, within a decade, the annual investment in major
new equipment, including related research and development expenditure
(equipment expenditure) to 20% or more of total defence spending.

97) Slovak defence spending will increase in both real terms and as a
percentage of GDP according to the needs of the defence the Slovak Republic
and allied commitments. This increase will be determined by the state of


-----

public finances and the ambition to achieve the level of 1.6% of GDP on
defence in 2020, while aiming for 2% of GDP in the long-term. Equipment
expenditure will adapt to the NATO criterion of spending a minimum of
20% of defence spending to gradually overcome long-term shortfalls in the
area of AF SR equipment and other materiel, including communication
and information systems.

98) An increase in defence spending will be achieved mainly by
Government investment in financially demanding strategic modernisation
projects, which will be approved and financed individually.

99) The development of national defence capacities (mainly AF SR
capabilities) will require, in the area of defence spending:

- a realistic and binding annual budget,

- a multiannual stability of budgetary cycles,

- long term predictability of planning assumptions,

- a gradual growth in line with the objective needs of the defence of

the Slovak Republic along with commitments to Allies.

100) Predictability of defence spending is a key precondition of their
effective allocation. It allows for a purposeful systematic development of
national defence capacities in tandem with the Slovak defence industry, as
well as an effective involvement of Slovakia in multiannual bilateral and
multinational development projects and initiatives.

101) Effort will be made to gradually increase Slovak defence spending and
by its effective allocation achieve:

- in the mid-term (by the end of 2020) a better balance between

national defence tasks and resources, including the execution of

priority armament projects,

- in the long-term (by the end of 2030) a marked reduction in long
term development shortfalls in the AF SR by the execution of most

large (strategic), financially demanding armament projects,

- full equilibrium between national defence tasks and allocated

resources, assuming national defence spending will approach 2%

of GDP in line with the long-term national ambition and

commitments within NATO.

102) When taking decisions to employ the AF SR abroad as part of NATO
and EU rapid reaction forces or other unbudgeted missions and operations,
the preference will be for such financing that will neither deprive other
activities, nor the development of the AF SR. The Slovak Government will
be presented with a declaration of AF SR units and assets provided to NATO
and EU rapid reaction forces, the employment of which (to complete tasks
abroad) will require a speedy release of funds for this purpose in excess of the
MoD budget.

103) The MoD will take measures ensuring the purposeful, efficient and
transparent allocation of resources, in particular:


Slovak defence spending
will increase according to
the needs of the defence
of the Slovak Republic
and allied commitments


-----

An improvement of the
defence planning system



- enhance defence planning system at the MoD and the national level

and harmonise it with NATO defence planning processes and EU

military capability development procedures,

- optimise the administrative structure and evaluate the effectiveness of

internal processes,

- systematically implement risk management at the MoD,

- increase the use of information technologies and electronic means

used in state administration, including the use of electronic auctions,

- streamline management of AF SR stocks,

- measures in the area of energy efficiency of buildings,

- cooperation at the inter-ministerial and international level in the area

of preparation of personnel and armament,

- a purposeful utilisation of resources from abroad, especially within

NATO and the EU.
Financial resources gained in this manner will be used first and foremost to
improve the AF SR.

104) In line with the constitutional authority and the principal of civilian
management and democratic oversight of armed forces, their tasks, the
financing of national defence and the level of defence capacities are determined
by democratically elected state authorities. Inevitably a risk to national
defence will arise if the Slovak Republic will not have the capacities and
capabilities to fully cover all threats in line with her politico-military
ambition.

### 3.5 Defence Planning

105) Defence planning integrating an entire spectrum of planning domains
(forces planning, resource planning, armament planning, logistics planning
etc.) will be the deciding tool of Government in creating and maintaining
defence capacities. This will include a balanced approach and the effective
allocation of resources to ensure required AF SR capacities and capabilities,
along with national defence support, in line with the needs of the defence of
the Slovak Republic and international commitments of Slovakia.

106) In order to achieve development aims effectively, a key precondition
must be the improvement of the defence planning system, tying in strategic
aims, mid-term programming priorities and the budget with the
procurement process, while ensuring harmony between individual planning
domains.

107) By improving the defence planning system, support will be given to
a more effective allocation of resources and to their more efficient and more
purposeful utilisation in order to complete tasks and improve the AF SR.
At the same time, the MoD will reinforce its ability and effectiveness in


-----

fulfilling its coordination function in the defence planning process. Stable
and transparent defence planning will allow for the involvement of the Slovak
defence industry in developing and obtaining equipment and other materiel
for the AF SR.

108) As the main product of defence planning at the MoD are battle-worthy
AF SR, all internal distribution of funds will be subordinated to this aim.
Regularly, there will be a procurement plan released, based on long and midterm plans. Emphasis will be placed on a clear statement of requirements of
the AF SR as part of improving the defence planning system.

109) Improvement of the defence planning system will primarily lead to:

- a deeper and better quality of partial outputs, as well as the quality

of overall results of defence planning by tying in strategic aims and

tasks with their resource backing and with procurement processes,

including a joint review and balancing of planned tasks and real

resources by responsible authorities of the MoD and the AF SR

General Staff, while enhancing transparency,

- the rationalisation of defence planning by simplifying its

fundamental processes and by clearly defining functional

responsibility and tasks of sponsors and co-sponsors in all phases,

- the integrated involvement of individual levels of defence

management and the command structure in defence planning

processes, in order to allow necessary choices to be made about

resource utilisation, especially in the context of the current condition

of defence capacities and resource possibilities,

- enhancing the flexibility of the system of continuous and cyclical

review of achieved results, including necessary timely systemic and

practical corrections while tasks and conditions are changing

(especially those concerning resources), while at the same time a

more transparent allocation and retroactive monitoring of

effectiveness of resource utilisation, in line with approved plans

emphasising planned development priorities will be better

arranged,

- the harmonisation of content and processes of the defence planning

of the Slovak Republic with the NATO Defence Planning Process,

emphasising the building and development of required capabilities,

the identification of minimal capability requirements, reception and

implementation of NATO Capability Targets for Slovakia as

well as the NATO Defence Planning Capability Review, including

the appointment of direct responsibility for specific inputs and

outputs. In the end, this will improve the conditions for harmonising

AF SR development plans primarily with partners in the Visegrad

group.

110) The key precondition of improving the defence planning system
will be the professional training of respective personnel and responsible
authorities, including the long-term continuity of expertise of those
authorities in the area of defence planning.

## Defence Management

_The aim of defence management is to continuously maintain and_
_develop the capacity of the Slovak Republic to resist armed attack and_
_effectively manage national defence while effectively utilising national_
_defence capacities._


### 4.1 Defining Defence Management

111) National defence management (carried out in line with the
constitutional and legal authority of constitutional bodies, the operation of
ministries, other central state administrative bodies and state administrative
bodies with a national scope of authority) is a continuous activity aimed
at preparing and taking measures concerning national defence, as well as
organising defence against armed attack. This mainly includes the evaluation
of threats and risks involving national defence, decision-making concerning
national defence; planning, organising, coordinating, control and evaluation
of implementation of these decisions, as well as verifying the readiness of
respective authorities to complete tasks in war-time.


112) Within the scope of their constitutional and legal authority, the
National Council of the Slovak Republic and the President of the Slovak
Republic decide on measures concerning national defence. The Government
is responsible for national security and defence. The MoD is the central state
administrative body in charge of defence management.

113) Defence management is carried out as part of the system of
national defence, which is a complex of entities and measures and their
interconnectedness by means of which the National Council of the Slovak
Republic, the Government, ministries, central state administrative bodies,
other state administrative bodies with a national scope of authority, local
administration bodies, municipalities and self-governing regions provide for
the preparation, administration and completion of national defence tasks.
Courts, the Attorney General, other legal entities, physical entities with the
right to run a business and physical entities provide for the preparation and
completion of national defence tasks.


-----

### 4.2 Requirements for Improving the System of National Defence

114) In light of the dynamically changing security environment, as well
as the character of threats and challenges, the state of alert and readiness of
forces and means of reaction will be reviewed. Preparedness of the Slovak
Republic for defence will be founded and improved on in the state of security,
involving an entire spectrum of activities. Key will be to improve national
defence management, which will require the improvement of intelligence,
the early warning system and situational awareness with the aim of a timely
identification of arising threats and a correct understanding of the complex
relationship between cause and effect of security threats.

115) Improving the decision-making processes of constitutional and state
administrative bodies in the area of defence, in the state of security as well
as in war-time, will be the basic precondition of improving national defence
management. This increases the demands placed on the effectiveness of
analytical, decision-making, coordinating, inspectional and supporting
activities of all entities responsible for national defence.

116) Ministries and other relevant state administrative bodies within the
scope of their responsibilities, along with specialised entities created in
order to evaluate risks and threats concerning national defence, will provide
relevant constitutional and state administrative bodies with timely, qualified
and trustworthy information concerning the rise of potential threats, their
risks and possible consequences, along with recommendations of how to
prevent or resolve them, and how to mitigate their effects.

117) In order to improve national defence management, comprehensive
planning of national defence will be introduced. This will entail defence
planning, planning of AF SR employment for the purposes of national
defence, AF SR mobilisation planning and economic mobilisation planning
for the purposes of national defence. To coordinate the above planning
activities, the MoD will prepare guidelines for the planning of national
defence, which will primarily establish the organisation of its preparation,
the complex of planning documents and the manner of its alinement.

118) The centre of gravity of the improvement of managing the
preparation for national defence will be primarily focused on the
preparation, maintenance and development of national defence capacities,
on augmenting AF SR capacities, on preparing ministries and other central
state administrative bodies, other state administrative bodies with a national
scope of authority, local state administrative and municipality bodies for
national defence (and for the verification of their readiness to complete tasks
in war-time) and also on preparing the populace for national defence.


The improvement
of intelligence and
decision-making
processes, and the
introduction
of comprehensive
planning of national
defence


-----

119) The centre of gravity of the improvement of defence management in
war-time will focus on enhancing the ability of respective state administrative
bodies to organise defence by systemically increasing and effectively utilising
defence capacities, together with utilising planned collective capacities and
capabilities to resist armed attack. Measures of national defence management
in war-time will be drafted in detail by the MoD in appropriate plans.

120) In order to improve our national defence management, measures will
be taken to deepen the functional harmonisation and synchronisation
of our national crisis response system with the NATO Crisis Response
System, including the improvement of the technical infrastructure used
for transmitting classified information. Processes of preparing and making
decisions by constitutional bodies concerning the transit and the presence
of allied forces on the territory of the Slovak Republic and also processes
concerning the sending of the AF SR abroad will be analysed in the context
of both the changed security environment and the decision-making processes
of international organisations of which Slovakia is a member, and if necessary,
proposals improving these processes will be drafted.

121) Key measures for improving national defence management will be
provided for as part of a comprehensive improvement of the system of
national defence within the system of national security. This will facilitate
a coordinated and effective functioning of public authority bodies in the
process of governing the state in all crisis situations (both military and nonmilitary).

122) Basic measures to improve the system of national defence will be defined
by the new _Defence Strategy of the Slovak Republic stemming from the_
_Security Strategy of the Slovak Republic. Comprehensive measures to improve_
the system of national defence will be elaborated in the System of National
_Defence Development Concept. Tying into the conceptual framework,_ the
improvement of the legal framework of national defence will continue.

123) Evaluation will also be part of improving our national defence
management. It will be focused on achieving set aims while effectively
utilising resources. Whether long-term aims and plans are being met will
be reviewed by the Strategic Defence Review Process initiated whenever
a fundamental change takes place in the political, security and resource
conditions of national defence, or whenever required. Its basic output is the
_White Paper on Defence of the Slovak Republic. Whether aims and tasks are_
being achieved will be continuously evaluated by the annual comprehensive
assessment of the defence of the Slovak Republic.


-----

### 4.3 Requirements for Improving and Optimising MoD Activities

124) Enhancing the MoD’s ability to continually perform tasks of a
central state administrative body responsible for national defence
management and AF SR development, while more effectively utilising
tools of strategic management to achieve set aims, will be a fundamental
requirement.

125) The ability of the MoD to perform its tasks not only in the
preparatory phase but also when organising defence in war-time, will be
a basic criterion of improving the quality and efficiency of the operation of
the MoD. Organisational and material conditions will be provided for the
MoD’s operation at a back-up location for the purposes of enhancing the
resilience and continuous operation of the MoD in war-time.

126) When the need to amend or widen the authority of the MoD
is identified, especially in the area of improving the preparation and
coordination activities of other ministries, other central state administrative
bodies, other state administrative bodies with a national scope of authority in
relation to national defence, appropriate adjustments to relevant legislation
will be drafted.

127) The operation of the administrative structure of the MoD will be
analysed from the point of view of processes, authority and activities
and with an emphasis on its ability to prepare, manage and provide for
national defence. Strategic, conceptual, planning, legislative, decisionmaking, evaluating and inspectional activities ensuring defence will be
strengthened on the basis of this analysis. Clear and specific delegation of
authority and the specific responsibility of particular MoD elements will
achieve their rationalisation, interlacing of functional areas and a higher level
of efficiency.

128) The MoD will formulate policy, strategies, concepts, legislation and
manage funds in order to ensure national defence, including the meeting of
international obligations. The AF SR General Staff will be responsible for
their implementation at the AF SR and also for the expert, organisational
and technical support of the AF SR command structure. The efficiency of
AF SR management and command structure will be determined by the
functional interconnectedness of the MoD and the General Staff, the level
of mutual communication and the synergy of efforts in working towards
common aims.

129) As the MoD is responsible for the preparation and management of
the AF SR mobilisation, it will conceptually elaborate the process of
integrating the standing AF SR with the mobilised elements after a partial

or a general mobilisation, especially in connection with realities resulting
from the AF SR employment plan in war-time. Ways of augmenting units in
relation to the actions of local state authorities undertaken in the area of AF
SR mobilisation will be elaborated.

130) The MoD will reinforce within the scope of its activities their strategic
dimension by, among others, the defence planning framework through
drafting long and mid-term plans with an emphasis on providing equipment
and other materiel, including communication and information systems.

### 4.4 MoD Ancillary Elements

131) _Military Intelligence with a structure and responsibilities in line with_
legislation, will be a special service for the support of national defence
processes. Improvement of its operation and oversight mechanisms will be
dealt with in the context of overall changes in the operation and organisation
of national intelligence services. Its capabilities of timely and continuous
identification of threats will be enhanced. Because of increasing threats and
attacks on critical infrastructure through cyberspace, Military Intelligence
will develop its capabilities in the area of cyber security. Emphasis will be
placed on ensuring the protection of the communication and information
technology infrastructure of the MoD and on ensuring support for the AF
SR in this domain.

132) Fulfilling specific functions connected with police protection, the
_Military Police, within the scope of MoD authority stipulated in the Legal_
Act number 124/1992 of the Collection of Laws on Military Police, will
continue to be primarily an auxiliary element in relation to AF SR operations.
Capabilities of the Military Police will be developed so that it may fulfil a
specific police function at the MoD, as well as to operate in order to ensure
AF SR activities stemming from the AF SR Legal Act and international
commitments, including counter-terrorist operations.

133) Elements, which provide auxiliary and other services for the MoD and
the AF SR are also part of the MoD. These are offices and facilities managed
by the MoD, budgetary and semi-budgetary organisations, as well as joint
stock companies with state shares managed by the MoD and also a stateowned company managed by the MoD. Tying into the long-term AF SR
development plan and the optimisation of AF SR structures, the offices and
facilities managed by the MoD, budgetary and semi-budgetary organisations
will undergo a process of evaluation and harmonisation with the needs of
national defence, while a continuous evaluation of effectiveness and the
optimisation of their operations will become the norm.

134) The _Military Technical and Testing Institute - Záhorie budgetary_
organisation, as the research and development facility of the MoD will


-----

manage the research, development and testing of arms, explosives, munitions,
equipment and materiel used by the AF SR.

135) The _Defence Standardisation, Codification and Quality Assurance_
_Bureau budgetary organisation, as a state administration body in the area of_
defence standardisation, codification and state quality control will fulfil its

quality control.

136) The _Training Centre - Lešť budgetary organisation will continue_
developing its potential with an emphasis on broadening its capacities for
AF SR needs, security and rescue services of the Slovak Republic, as well as
foreign partners.

137) The _Military Sports Centre - Dukla Banská Bystrica budgetary_
organisation will provide for the preparation of athletes in individual sport
disciplines in order to represent both the AF SR and the Slovak Republic.
With the aim of efficiently utilising its specific know-how and experience of
sports branches related to martial or military activity (martial arts, shooting
sports), as well as in the interest of an overall improvement of the physical
condition of soldiers, the centre will closely cooperate with the AF SR.

138) The _Military History Institute budgetary organisation will continue_
to fulfil its expert function concerning military history, military museums,
archives, overall care for national cultural monuments, cultural monuments
overseen by the Institute, as well as the digitalisation of the archive fund and
collection items.

139) The _Ordinariate of the Armed Forces and Armed Corps of the_
_Slovak Republic budgetary organisation will provide spiritual services to_
catholic worshippers in the AF SR, armed corps and rescue services (fire
department, mountain rescue), along with their family members, and also
provide spiritual services to incarcerated persons. The Centre of Ecumenical
_Pastoral Services in the Armed Forces and Armed Corps of the Slovak_
_Republic budgetary organisation will manage the organisational and expert_
aspects of the ecumenical pastoral service in the AF SR and armed corps
of the Slovak Republic, and will also extend pastoral care to worshippers of
registered churches and religious societies. Both budgetary organisations will
contribute, within the scope of their authority, to higher moral qualities of
military personnel.

140) The AF SR Academy of Milan Rastislav Štefánik budgetary organisation
will provide university-level education to future AF SR officers and will
also provide for a continuous career and vocational training of professional
soldiers, while its military character will be strengthened in order to ensure


-----

the long-term development of university-level education and vocational
training and exercises in line with AF SR requirements, including the
training of professional soldiers in the area of cyber security. In the interest
of maintaining and developing capabilities, it will continue to augment and
rejuvenate its academic staff with professional soldiers. The Academy will
support the two-way mobility of academic staff and cadets, especially within
the EU. It will continue to carry out research and development as a sponsor
of military science development in Slovakia. It will also provide education to
the civilian personnel of the MoD and other bodies of public administration,
which will be focused on matters of national security and defence.

141) The _Military Office of Social Welfare budgetary organisation will_
carry out tasks connected with providing sick-pay, injury claims, retirement
pensions and social welfare services in line with the Legal Act number
328/2002 of the Collection of Laws on Social Welfare of Law Enforcement
Officers and Soldiers. The optimisation of its operation will be aided by a
greater use of communication and information technologies.

142) Semi-budgetary organisations:

- The Housing Agency of the MoD will, at the latest, be abolished after

disposing of all housing under its supervision.

- The _Central Military Hospital - Ružomberok – Teaching Hospital_

will provide medical care and will carry out tasks connected with the

medical support of national defence.

143) The process of rationalisation and streamlining of operations according
to the needs of national defence will continue in the joint stock companies
the Aircraft Repair Company Trenčín JSC (a defence industry company) and
_HOREZZA JSC (a recreation services company) managed by the MoD.[4] In_
the above mentioned defence industry companies, emphasis will be placed
on the utilisation of their production, repair, construction, development and
testing capacities for the benefit of the AF SR.

144) The state-owned enterprise Military Forests and Estates of the Slovak
_Republic will carry out activities leading to an efficient and ecological_
management of forest and agricultural land in military districts and in military
forests. Measures will be taken to improve the efficiency of its operations.

## Armed Forces Development

_The AF SR are a pillar of statehood and are a decisive tool of the system_
_of national defence._
_The aim of AF SR development are modern, operationally ready and_
_credible armed forces, possessing an adequate war-fighting potential, capable_
_of ensuring the defence of the Slovak Republic, taking part in collective defence_
_of Allies and contributing to conflict resolution in missions and operations_
_abroad. The AF SR will be able to decisively, actively and effectively carry_
_out appointed tasks concerning the defence, protection, support, maintaining_
_and promoting the security interests of the Slovak Republic._


AF SR transformation
will be focused primarily
on increasing the quality
of their capabilities


145) In line with the _Defence Strategy of the Slovak Republic_ a Military
_Strategy of the Slovak Republic will be drafted in order to aid the achievement_
of this aim. This Military Strategy will elaborate the military aspects of
ensuring national defence in the Defence Strategy and will direct further AF
SR transformation.

146) AF SR transformation will be focused primarily on increasing the
quality of their capabilities and critical capacities, largely by continuing
the purposeful rearmament of tactical units and by outfitting them with
equipment and other materiel, including communication and information
systems with an emphasis on command and control. Enhanced combat
capabilities of the AF SR will be the main measurable criterion of the
success of their transformation.


147) At the same time, the necessary reorganisation of the Armed Forces
will continue as part of their transformation. All tactical units will be
structured according to: NATO standards in line with the needs of defending
the Slovak Republic, experiences gained on missions and operations abroad,
as well as NATO requirements in the context of NATO Capability Targets
for Slovakia.

148) The main effort of AF SR development until 2018 will be focused on
achieving the aim of the full operational capability of a mechanised brigade.
The capacity and effectiveness of combat, combat support and combat
service support units will be enhanced. Conditions will be created for
carrying out mobilisation tasks by AF SR units and the storage of materiel


-----

for units formed in war-time and supplies needed to ensure their war-fighting
ability. Chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) units will be
strengthened. By continuing the development of the ISTAR battalion, the
required increase in intelligence and reconnaissance capacities at the tactical
level will be achieved.

149) SOF and other forces and capabilities, including those employable in
counter-terrorist, counter-hybrid and counter-cyber threats operations will
be strengthened.

150) The ability of the AF SR to take part in disaster relief operations in
the wake of natural and industrial disasters on the territory of the Slovak
Republic will be enhanced, especially by intensifying joint preparations with
the elements of the Integrated Rescue System.

### 5.1 The Required Force and Capability Structures of the Future Armed Forces

151) To carry out their tasks stemming from both national legislation and
the international commitments of the Slovak Republic, the AF SR must have
the capacities to cover the generation, preparation, deployment, maintenance
and regeneration of capabilities in order to ensure:

- individually or collectively the defence of the Slovak Republic with

the aid of other elements of the system of national defence,

- the formation and preparation of reserves and the mobilisation of the

AF SR,

- stocks of materiel for AF SR mobilisation, as well as compounds and

infrastructure to accommodate reserves and their training,

- command and control, the build-up and maintenance of command

posts, including their defence and protection,

- continuous protection and defence of the air space of the Slovak

Republic within NATINAMDS,

- the contribution of a mechanised brigade for collective defence,

- other capabilities necessary for meeting the international obligations

of Slovakia,

- contributions to missions and operations abroad,

- military capabilities to carry out tasks in non-military emergencies on

the territory of the Slovak Republic,

- continuous monitoring of the security situation in order to identify

emerging threats in a timely fashion,

- protection and defence of information systems within the scope of the

MoD against cyber-attack,

- completion of tasks in the area of HNS.


-----

152) The analysis of AF SR tasks stemming from national legislation,
international commitments and Government decisions resulted in the defining
of essential capacities and capabilities necessary for the long-term performance
of these tasks. The set of these essential capacities and capabilities form the so
called basic AF SR model (further on referred to just as the “Basic Model”),
the core of which are 6 brigades, including C2 arrangements, combat support
and combat service support elements.

153) Maintaining the AF SR at the level of the Basic Model in the state of
security is not financially sustainable in the long-term. In the state of security
the AF SR will be maintained so as to ensure minimal military capacity and
capability requirements enabling the AF SR to perform their tasks and to
meet international obligations of the Slovak Republic, while at the same
time to possess capabilities enabling AF SR mobilisation.

154) AF SR units will be maintained at required levels of readiness
according to their tasks, to which end a system of multi-annual cyclic tasking
of units (the lifecycle of units) will be applied. Units will pass in regular
cycles the stages of preparation, an assigned level of readiness, employment
and regeneration. The lifecycle of AF SR units will be adjusted in line with
the needs of national defence and NATO readiness requirements.

155) The Basic Model together with the planning preconditions for
ensuring national defence form the basic framework of providing for
the needs of national defence. As part of the Basic Model a financially
achievable AF SR model will be defined – AF SR administrative structure

- peacetime establishment numbers.

156) The future AF SR 2030 administrative structure - peacetime
establishment numbers (circa 21 000 professional soldiers and civilian staff)
quantifies not only personnel but also required capacities, capabilities and C2
structures maintained in the state of security. It will allow for a more effective
and comprehensive preparation of the AF SR and ensure their operation
until the moment that either war preparations or war itself are begun. It will
also ensure the availability of capacities necessary for the mobilisation of the
AF SR for war.

157) The future AF SR 2030 administrative structure – organigram:

The General Staff of the
AF SR

Special Operations DSUF
Land Forces Air Forces
Forces General Staff

158) In order to carry out these tasks the AF SR will maintain forces,
headquarters and units in designated readiness levels. They will also have at

|The General Staff of the AF SR Special Operations DSUF Land Forces Air Forces Forces General Staff|Col2|
|---|---|
|Land Forces|DSUF General Staff|


-----

their disposal capabilities in line with NATO standards and will be able to
take part in a wide spectrum of current and future conflicts.

159) Mobilised AF SR reserves are the difference between the Basic
Model and the AF SR administrative structure - peacetime establishment
numbers.

160) The AF SR will comprise the following basic administrative services
and elements: Land Forces, Air Force, Special Operations Forces and Directly
Subordinated Units and Facilities (DSUF) of the AF SR General Staff.

- The principal tasks of the Land Forces, which are the determining

factor for the size and effectiveness of the AF SR, will be to ensure

the defence of the Slovak Republic against military threats and to carry

out tasks in non-military emergencies on the territory of the Slovak

Republic. The Land Forces will have at their disposal capacities and

capabilities to plan and direct ground operations, as well as to form the

core of a joint force for joint operations on the territory of the Slovak

Republic. They will include combat elements (infantry equipped

with multirole tactical vehicles and armoured fighting vehicles, tanks),

combat support elements (fire support, air defence, ISTAR and

electronic warfare, engineer, Civil-Military Co-operation - CIMIC,

Psychological Operations - PSYOPS and CBRN elements), combat

service support elements (logistic and medical service support elements,

materiel, personnel service and administration elements) and command

support elements (staffs, communication, intelligence and information

systems).

- The principal tasks of the Air Force will be the defence and protection

of the airspace of the Slovak Republic as part of NATINAMDS,

tactical air support of Land Forces operations and air transport. To

this end the Air Force will have at its disposal interoperable C2

capabilities, a tactical air force unit, a helicopter unit, a tactical air

transport unit, and capabilities of radar and radio-electronic

reconnaissance, as well as air defence.

- The principal tasks of SOF will be to conduct missions of special

reconnaissance, direct action and military assistance to security forces

of foreign partners. SOF will be able to operate independently or in

support of joint special operations, including counter-terrorist

operations.

161) Support for the AF SR General Staff, forces, units and facilities of the
AF SR will be provided by:

- a command support unit of the AF SR General Staff,

- the stationary communication and information systems in operating

and developing the network of communication and information

systems within the scope of the MoD, along with their protection

and defence against cyber-attacks,

- the military medical service providing health care, as well as

medical support to training, deployed missions and operations

abroad. The _Military Medical Support Development Concept will_


-----

be updated with an aim to harmonise military health care

development with AF SR requirements and NATO standards,

- AF SR offices and facilities in the area of AF SR centralised personnel

management, linguistic preparedness of AF SR personnel, providing

for AF SR personnel on NATO and EU military staffs, and also

provide for strategic-level AF SR logistic support.

162) In keeping with NATO measures reacting to changes in the security
environment, the establishment of the Slovak NFIU will continue and it will
become fully operational in 2017.

163) The AF SR will be able to integrate AF SR reserves in the event of
both a general and a partial mobilisation, protect and defend Facilities of
Special Importance and Other Important Facilities, while providing support
to allied forces on the territory of the Slovak Republic.

### 5.2 Key Capability Areas to Improve

164) The AF SR will develop a spectrum of military capabilities necessary
for carrying out their tasks. The transformation of tactical units will be
based on a comprehensive approach to military capability development and
the interconnectedness of the following areas – doctrines; administrative
structure; equipment and other materiel, including communication and
information systems; training; preparation of leaders and personnel;
infrastructure and interoperability – with an aim to achieve their greater
effectiveness and deployability.

165) Doctrines. The complex of military doctrines will be updated and
amended. By the end of 2016 the AF SR Doctrine (C) will be completed with
the aim of implementing the know-how and the lessons learned on missions
and operations led by NATO and the EU, as well as during unit training,
into the doctrinal framework of the AF SR. The amendment of the entire
military doctrinal architecture will be gradually continued.

166) Administrative structure. Changes of the administrative structure
of AF SR tactical units will be gradually carried out, depending upon the
replacement of major military equipment. Other changes will depend on
current capability development requirements, as well as allocated resources.
The end-state structure will also include newly formed units or units with
capabilities answering new security challenges.

167) Equipment and other materiel, including communication and
information systems. An increase in combat capabilities resulting from
the (re)arming of tactical units will be the primary measurable indicator of


-----

the success of transformation and the overall success of AF SR capability
development. The basic condition of achieving required capabilities by
the end of 2030 is either a replacement of major military equipment by
a purposeful rearmament of tactical units or a militarily justified and
economically effective modernisation of major military equipment.

168) Stockpiles. The system of organising and maintaining stockpiles of
materiel, as well as the delivery system of goods and services, not only for AF
SR support but also for the purposes of HNS, will be re-evaluated. Emphasis
will be placed on a continued stockpiling of essential supplies necessary
for AF SR mobilisation. Further efforts to achieve a balanced condition of
materiel supplies with an aim to improve the effectiveness of their stockpiling
will be continued. Logistic AF SR capabilities will be utilised to the outmost
in order to sustain the AF SR in operations and rebuild their war-fighting
ability by utilising repair services and distribution capacities. The AF SR
transportation and supply system will be overhauled.

169) Training. The intensity of AF SR training will be enhanced and their
participation in exercises focused on the defence of the Slovak Republic will
be provided for. The approach to training and exercises will be based on two
main, organically interconnected pillars – AF SR training on the territory of
the Slovak Republic and AF SR training with foreign partners on the territory
of the Slovak Republic or abroad, while emphasising cooperation with the
armed forces of NATO and EU member states. Training and exercises will
be planned and carried out in order to achieve and maintain assigned levels
of readiness of AF SR formations, staffs and units with an emphasis on a
mechanised brigade. Training of commanders and staffs will be focused on
the ability to plan high intensity joint operations in defence of the Slovak
Republic or the collective defence of an Ally within a complex operational
environment including hybrid, cybernetic and terrorist threats. AF SR
readiness to perform tasks alongside the Police Force, the Fire Department,
the Rescue Service and other elements of the Integrated Rescue System will
be enhanced by a joint preparation of specialists, intensified joint training
and exercises. Improvements to joint preparations to perform tasks as part
of the Integrated Rescue System in cases of non-military threats and in the
area of counter-terrorism will be continued during joint exercises with other
elements of this system and in joint exercises with the Police Force and other
armed corps.

170) Preparation of leaders. Preparation of leaders will be applied in all
forms of education and training through which a professional soldier receives
his or her qualification and fulfils requirements of military service with an
aim to develop his or her abilities to perform operational tasks (and other
duties) and effectively lead subordinates by a mixture of personal example,
motivation and insistence on results.

171) Personnel. The number of professional soldiers will gradually be
increased to ensure that the overall manning of AF SR units is improved.
Sufficient personnel numbers will be maintained in the state of security in


The intensity of AF SR
training will be enhanced


-----

The number
of professional soldiers
will gradually be increased
to ensure that the overall
manning of AF SR units
is improved


order to perform the entire spectrum of AF SR tasks, including mobilisation.
In the area of improving military personnel, its overall expert military
preparation and education will be provided in unison with improving
their moral qualities, patriotism, as well as the resolve and preparedness of
professional soldiers to perform national defence tasks. Comprehensive
efforts will be continued to retain key and highly qualified military
personnel, which will require measures enhancing the attractiveness of a
military career by amending national legislation and internal regulations,
as well as maintaining the specialised social welfare system of professional
soldiers. These changes will create competitive conditions on the labour
market, particularly for higher commanders and managers, and also highly
qualified personnel in specific military vocations such as: military medical
service, aviation and air defence, communication and information systems.

172) Infrastructure. Changes in AF SR peace-time infrastructure, including
the stationing of HQs and units, will be carried out especially in connection
with maintaining key infrastructure essential for carrying out tasks in wartime. Peace-time infrastructure development projects will be aimed at
enhancing the quality of living and working conditions of soldiers, and also
at enhancing the quality and effectiveness of unit training at their base of
operations and military training areas. It is necessary to include the gradual
reconstruction of buildings in disrepair that are located in AF SR barracks
among priorities.

173) Interoperability. Interoperability with allied forces must be
procedural, technical and operational. To enhance capability interoperability,
including carrying out tasks in operations jointly and eliminating AF SR
capability shortfalls, multilateral (NATO, EU, Visegrad Group) and bilateral
cooperation initiatives and projects will be utilised. Bilateral cooperation
will be based on a pragmatic approach to states, the relations with which
have a long-term military and economic potential. The enhancement of AF
SR interoperability with allied forces will be advanced by cooperation in the
area of training and education, including the utilisation of special educational
and training facilities within the scope of the MoD.

174) AF SR mobilisation. The ability of the AF SR to integrate, equip and
train reservists will be enhanced.

175) Internal AF SR processes. Internal processes of the AF SR will be
simplified and made more effective. The development of the planning and
development of force structures and capabilities framework, as part of the
defence planning of the Slovak Republic, will be continued. Procedures
regarding the AF SR taking part in operations and missions abroad and
carrying out tasks during non-military emergencies on the territory of the
Slovak Republic, will be optimised with the aim of improving the reaction
to urgent operational demands. Initiatives to improve the quality and
effectiveness of HQ staff work will be implemented.


-----

176) Overall progress of AF SR capability development will be measured
by the achieved set of capabilities. The transformation of an HQ or a unit
will be completed by issuing a certificate of achieved operational readiness
according to measurable indicators of NATO certification standards.

### 5.3 The Capability Development Strategy

177) The AF SR capability development strategy is based on a comprehensive
transformation of tactical formations and units in line with the defence of the
Slovak Republic needs and its international obligations. This strategy will be
carried out with the purposeful modernisation or replacement of equipment
and other materiel, including communication and information systems. Its
aim is to enhance the level of AF SR capacities and combat capabilities, as
well as their interoperability with allied forces.

178) Well-armed and well trained armed forces, with at least four brigades
at their disposal in the state of security will be the capability development
end-state. These brigades will have efficient C2 systems, an enhanced
qualitative level of capabilities and of interoperability, and will be able to
operate separately or as part of NATO and EU formations.

179) The AF SR capability development strategy takes into account the
current NATO defence planning cycle, particularly its minimum capability
requirements and the preparation of the 2017 NATO Capability Targets for
Slovakia. These targets confirm the transfer of mechanised capabilities to a
“heavy” category with great demands on an enhanced combat potential of
units and the protection of platforms.

180) The AF SR capability development strategy will be implemented so
as not to hamper ongoing operational tasks (the protection and defence of
Slovak airspace, participation in missions and operations abroad and the
performing of tasks as part of NATO and EU rapid reaction forces). AF
SR capacities and capabilities employable in non-military emergencies on
the territory of the Slovak Republic will be maintained. AF SR capability
development will be carried out in two phases.

181) In phase I (between 2016 and 2020), the full spectrum of current
capabilities with a gradual improvement of the AF SR combat potential
will be maintained. The full operational capability of a mechanised brigade,
enhanced capabilities of an ISTAR battalion including tactical electronic
warfare capacities, along with enhanced combat support and combat service
support capacities for a mechanised brigade (including a mechanised
battalion group) in line with NATO Capability Targets for Slovakia, will
constitute the end-state. Also, the counter-terrorist capabilities of SOF will be

potential


-----

enhanced. Moreover, C2 systems, AF SR mobilisation capabilities, including
the ability to achieve necessary capabilities and AF SR logistic capacities, will
be enhanced. In order to ensure the required AF SR capabilities, necessary
modernisation projects will be carried out in line with set priorities.

182) In phase I, armament priorities

- of the Land Forces will be:

- the development of mechanised capabilities:

   - begin arming one mechanised battalion with an 8x8 armoured

fighting vehicle platform,

   - continue with the replacement/modernisation of Infantry

Fighting Vehicles of mechanised units,

- the development of motorised and reconnaissance capabilities:

   - begin arming an ISTAR battalion with a 4x4 multirole tactical

vehicle platform,

   - begin arming a motorised battalion with 4x4 armoured fighting

vehicle and 4x4 multirole tactical vehicle platforms,

- the development of other capabilities:

   - replace and modernise other major military equipment and

materiel, and also the materiel of combat support units of the

Land Forces for a mechanised brigade and a mechanised battalion

group, including 3[rd] generation anti-tank guided missile systems,

   - solve interoperability and compatibility of AF SR communication

and information systems, including the mobile communication

system (MOKYS) and provide necessary communication and

information systems for AF SR command posts, primarily at the

tactical and operational level in order to meet the certification

criteria by a mechanised brigade,

   - continue with replacing vehicles, augmenting and replacing

logistical container and handling equipment, workshop, repair

and field facilities, as well as the facilities of medical services

capacities with the aim of comprehensively rearming logistics

battalions, a combat support battalion and a repair battalion of

the combat service support brigade.

- of the Air Force will be:

- the development of transport capabilities

   - complete replacing transport aircraft,

- the development of helicopter capabilities:

   - continue replacing multirole helicopters,

- maintain the multirole tactical aircraft capability:

   - launch the replacement of tactical air-force hardware,

- the development of air defence and airfield capabilities:

   - begin the replacement of radars with new types of close, short and

medium-range 3D radars; begin the replacement of airfield radars,

   - begin the replacement of Air Force radio-electronic reconnaissance

components,

- development of other Air Force capabilities:

   - begin the replacement of automated air defence C2 systems,

   - replace control systems and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for

the purposes of Imagery Intelligence - IMINT.


-----

- of SOF will be:
   - to continue with the procurement of weaponry for the SOF

service, which will be developed as an independent component

within the AF SR,

   - to enhance training capacities and tactical mobility.

183) Decisions will be taken in the first phase on the basis of an expert
military report concerning the following main armament projects:

- armoured fighting vehicles – launch the procurement of 8x8

armoured fighting vehicles, 4x4 armoured fighting vehicles, 4x4

multirole tactical vehicles, all of which are a condition sine qua non

for a fully-fledged mechanised battalion, an ISTAR battalion, the 23[rd]

Motorised Battalion, CIMIC and PSYOPS units respectively,

- battle tanks – maintain this capability and by the end of the first phase

prepare a tank unit development plan (taking into account the 2017

NATO Capability Targets for Slovakia),

- trainer jets – extend the lifespan of the L-39 aircraft or their

replacement with new multipurpose sub-sonic jets,

- multipurpose helicopters – complete the replacement of medium

multipurpose helicopters in line with the contractual framework in

order to achieve required operational capabilities. Take steps to

maintain operational capabilities of the helicopter element to carry

out tasks in case of non-military emergencies on the territory of the

Slovak Republic,

- attack helicopters – procure new attack helicopters depending on the

recommendations of an analysis of needs and possibilities in the

context of the security environment evolution,

- air-defence systems – ensure maintenance of the operational

capabilities of air-defence systems, emphasising the firing component

of air-defence and their possible development.

184) Also, measures will be taken in the first phase in order to:

- enhance intelligence and electronic warfare capabilities,

- improve the effectiveness of C2 systems and continue with measures

to optimise the war-time AF SR administrative structure,

- enhance logistical capabilities for national defence tasks, including

HNS,

- improve the effectiveness of logistics services covering the entire

spectrum of AF SR logistical support and enhance the logistics support

of the AF SR, especially in the area of nutrition and repair

capabilities,

- improve the effectiveness of the centralised procurement system and

transfer necessary authority in favour of other entities (AF SR units),

- enhance the operation of AF SR support and rear administration and

facilities,

- maintain essential AF SR capacities and capabilities in the area of

cyber-defence,

- implement allied documents for the support of AF SR staffs, formations

and units with an aim of achieving and maintaining interoperability


-----

The AF SR will have
at their disposal a larger
number of units at higher
readiness


with allied forces in line with NATO Capability Targets for Slovakia,

the Headline Aims of the EU and NATINAMDS; as well as documents

for the preparation and the evaluation of those AF SR units that will

be declared for NATO and EU rapid reaction forces.

185) In phase II (between 2021 and 2030) the overall AF SR war-fighting
potential will increase, along with their ability to carry out tasks connected
with the defence of the Slovak Republic and its international commitments.
The end-state in the state of security will be a sustained, fully operational
capability of a mechanised brigade (in line with NATO Capability Targets
for Slovakia), enhanced intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance
capacities at the operational and tactical levels. At the same time, combat
support and combat service support capacities for a mechanised brigade,
including a mechanised battalion group, will be provided for. AF SR
capacities to carry out missions and operations abroad will be enhanced. By
the end of the second phase, the AF SR will have a larger number of units
at higher readiness at their disposal. Modernisation projects in line with set
priorities will be carried through in order to provide for the necessary AF SR
capabilities.

186) In phase II, armament priorities

- of the Land Forces will be:

- the development of mechanised/tank capabilities:

   - to procure equipment and other materiel necessary for the

finalisation of building additional capabilities, including

capabilities for the planning and combat support of special air

operations,

   - to procure equipment and othermateriel to develop capabilities

required for counter-terrorist operations, including air mobility

and, at the same time, for sustaining tactical land mobility.

### 5.4 Command and Control

187) The AF SR will develop their C2 system with a high level of
interoperability with allied forces. In phase I, the personnel capacities of
the General Staff administrative structures will be enhanced with the aim
of enhancing and maintaining essential capabilities required to maintain
the ability to plan and manage operations, as well as to command the AF
SR. Emphasis will be placed on the resilience and sustainability of AF SR
command and on ensuring a fluent transition towards C2 arrangements
in war-time conditions. Necessary procedural and structural changes will
continue in order to strengthen the unity of command and control at the
particular levels of command. The capability and efficiency of AF SR C2
arrangements in preparing, coordinating and ensuring performance in
relation to the collective defence of the Slovak Republic will be enhanced by
the formation of the Slovak NFIU.

188) In phase II, the implementation of measures for maintaining and
enhancing AF SR C2 capabilities will be continued. Decisions on the further
development of C2 structures will be taken in the context of changes in the
security environment, including the possibility of merging individual branch
HQs into one HQ in the state of security.


The AF SR will develop
their C2 system


-----

### 5.5 Risks Involved

189) Measures to eliminate ongoing risks will be taken and implemented
in the area of:

- maintaining essential AF SR capabilities already necessary in the state

of security,

- the technical condition of outdated military equipment and the

lagging of AF SR technical level of major military equipment behind

NATO standards,

- the resource demands on repair, maintenance and retention of outdated

military equipment and other materiel, including communication and

information systems,

- the depletion of munition, fuel and other materiel supplies intended

for crisis situations, as well as overall AF SR supply shortfalls,

- the intensity and quality of AF SR unit training.

190) Battle-worthy units capable of carrying out their mission without major
limitations will be considered the basic output of the AF SR transformation
process. Its conclusion, as well as a possible increase in AF SR tasks, require
the allocation of adequate resources.

## Human Resources Development in the scope of the MoD


_The aim of human resources development in the scope of the MoD is to_
_increase the knowledge, abilities and skills of military and civilian personnel,_
_improve their workplace and social conditions, retain highly qualified_
_professional soldiers, develop the military university-level education, career_
_and vocational training system, as well as to improve the efficiency of the AF_
_SR augmentation system._

### 6.1 Personnel Management


191) Personnel management at the MoD will provide an increase in the
quality of the internal environment in the area of manpower management
and social policy, which will enable a comprehensive, optimal and
efficient development of human resources necessary for national defence
development, including AF SR transformation.

192) An increase in the complexity of national defence tasks also increases
the demands on the educational, professional and moral qualities of
military and civilian personnel. All resources available will be utilised in
order to provide for these requirements, and when needed, changes in
national legislation and internal regulations will be proposed.


### 6.2 Improving and Replenishing Military Personnel

_Improving military personnel_


193) The basic condition of improving and retaining highly qualified
professional soldiers will be the purposeful and effective utilisation of
investment put into professional soldiers and into their work environment.


-----

Know-how gained from the experience of applying national legislation
and internal regulations concerning the military service of professional
soldiers will be regularly analysed. This will form the basis of the proposal
of measures aimed at stabilisation and motivation factors related to the
performance of military service by professional soldiers, which will make it
more attractive and more competitive on the labour market.

194) The system of rewarding professional soldiers will have a significant
impact on providing stability and motivation for professional soldiers,
their systematic rotation and recruitment. This system will be reviewed
and adjusted on the basis of experience gained and the development of the
national minimum and average wage, taking into consideration performed
functions and activities.

195) A quality of life of the professional soldier model, will be added
to the tools of personnel management. This model will define standards,
comparable with those of other NATO member states, which are desirable
especially in the areas of: the conditions under which professional soldiers
execute military service, social policy, family life and housing.

196) The implementation of the support programs system will increase
the level of care provided to professional soldiers. These programs will take
into account the needs of professional soldiers and their families.

197) Professional soldiers will be provided with first-class, internationally
comparable education in the area of national defence, military universitylevel education in all three degree-levels, as well as the military preparation
and training of future officers. Continuous education will be provided to
professional soldiers over the course of their military career.

198) During the course of the military preparation of professional
soldiers and their education, emphasis will be placed on improving the level
of expertise, moral qualities, character and the nurturing of patriotism in
keeping with national and military traditions.

199) As part of the development of military education:

- an institutional accreditation of the AF SR Academy will be carried

out through NATO Allied Command Transformation for the quality

management of provided education and training in accordance with

NATO standards,

- student profiles of the Academy graduates will be flexibly updated

so that they correspond with the newest findings of military science

and most recent AF SR demands,

- the level of expertise of the Academy graduates in specific military

fields will be enhanced by flexibly interlacing, as part of study programs,

theoretical training at the Academy with traineeships in AF SR units

and facilities, and with practical training at AF SR training facilities,

- part of the system of education and preparation of professional soldiers

will also be the education and preparation in Slovak civilian


The system of rewarding
professional soldiers will
be reviewed and adjusted

Emphasis will be placed
on improving the level of
expertise, moral qualities
and character
of professional soldiers


-----

universities, and for specific military fields, in military educational

institutions abroad,

- the condition of career and vocational training will be analysed and

measures will be taken to optimise them with the aim of creating

conditions for effective carrier planning and professional training,

specified in the career structure by a military occupational field

supervisor, tying in to staffing objectives in the career of professional

soldiers,

- an appropriate system of professional training in fields that are found

wanting will be created in order to ensure sufficient military personnel

professionally prepared at the secondary school level.

200) Major factors influencing the career of professional soldiers and
constituting a relevant part of their professional profile, will be the graduation
from career and professional courses abroad, experiences gained on missions
and operations abroad and in the NATO and EU command structures.

201) Internal regulations concerning the linguistic education at the MoD
are being updated with the aim of taking into account the rising requirements
on the level of linguistic preparedness of professional soldiers. The number
of hours cadets are taught the English language at the Academy will be
increased, along with an increase of English lessons at the career courses
(depending on the level of these courses). This will support the increase of
linguistic proficiency of professional soldiers over the course of their career.

202) The specialised social welfare system of professional soldiers
interconnected with the rules of professional military service will be one
of the deciding factors of retaining high-quality personnel in the AF SR,
and for this reason, the level of entitlements from the Social Welfare and
Retirement System will be retained. For the purposes of improving the
quality of this social welfare system it will be monitored and evaluated
further.

203) In the case of replacing military personnel, notice will be taken
of the character of the activities carried out in connection to the military
occupational field and its specialisation. Replacements will be continuously
monitored, while the age structure of professional soldiers in specific ranks
will be analysed, and short and long-term measures will be proposed
according to AF SR requirements in relation to the age structure of AF SR
professional soldiers.

204) Appropriate conditions will be created for the transition of professional
soldiers to a civilian environment and their ability to be assertive on the
labour market after concluding their military service.

_Recruitment_

205) Forms and methods of recruitment will be adapted to modern
conditions with an emphasis on the electronic dimension. Their content will


-----

focus on target groups of the general public, especially from the point of view
of their received education, for the replenishment of corresponding ranks
and military occupational fields according to AF SR needs. A more effective
strategy of promoting the AF SR and a timely, targeted marketing strategy
will be a major factor of the recruitment process.

206) In order to achieve and ensure a higher quality of the recruitment
process, admission criteria placed on prospective candidates and the
qualitative output parameters that successful candidates must meet will be
continually assessed.

### 6.3 Generating and Preparing Reserves

207) Training of the active reserves, which are given top priority, will be
provided for by the AF SR in respect to organisation, personnel, materiel
and training capacities. The expert part of their training will be carried out
in the unit for which they are being prepared. The quality of training and its
benefits for the augmentation of appropriate units, conditions set up for the
training of soldiers of the active reserves in line with national legislation and
its perception by the public will be assessed.

208) AF SR reserves will also be formed by means of voluntary military
training. This kind of training will be periodically and broadly assessed,
including its contribution to the formation of reserve forces.

209) Based on the evaluation of the effectiveness of active reserve training
and the contribution of voluntary military training to the formation of AF
SR reserve forces, either measures for their development or an additional
instrument for the formation of AF SR reserves and the enhancement of
their readiness will be prepared.

### 6.4 Education and Care for Civilian Personnel

210) The expertise of civilian personnel will be increased by relevant
training, including specific areas concerning national security and defence,
carried out in departmental and non-departmental training facilities and
institutions.


The training of active
reserves will be given top
priority


-----

211) Attention will be given to improving working conditions of civilian
personnel at the MoD. Social policy will be part of these conditions in order
to acquire, retain and motivate civilian personnel.

## Armament

_The aim of armament is to ensure the qualitative and quantitative_
_availability of military equipment and other materiel, including_
_communication and information systems in order to ensure the completion_
_of AF SR tasks, especially those concerning national defence._


Armament will be
systemically tied to
enhancing AF SR
capabilities


### 7.1 Key Requirements 

212) National defence tasks in the changed security environment will
be decisive for the focus of armament, which will be systemically tied to
enhancing AF SR capabilities and implemented purposefully in order
to augment, modernise or replace military equipment and other materiel,
including communication and information systems of an entire AF SR unit.


213) Armament will be founded on its resource base in defence planning,
emphasising the entire life cycle of defence systems, equipment and related
services provided in Slovakia and other NATO and EU member states.

214) Replacement or modernisation of military equipment and other
materiel, including communication and information systems will be carried
out to ensure long-term sustainability, while strategic projects will
be provided for and supported by the Government by approving and
financing them individually. Armament projects monitored by and decided
on by the Government will be financed either within the limits of the MoD
budget, or by specially allocated additional funds beyond the limits of the
MoD budget chapter.


215) Special Governmental approval and financing of projects concerning
major military equipment is a prerequisite of concluding such projects in a
shorter time, which will support a targeted modernisation or replacement of
the military hardware of an entire AF SR unit and a timelier acquisition of
necessary capabilities.


-----

216) Possibilities of modernising military equipment and other materiel,
including communication and information systems already in use will be
considered in the preparatory phase of projects from the point of view of
military expertise, economic effectiveness and the potential of their further
use. An economically advantageous unification military hardware, justified
by military experts, will be carried out. Along with armament projects,
a stock of materiel will be amassed, with an emphasis on spare parts and
ammunition.

217) The modernisation or replacement of major military equipment will
allow for a deeper involvement of the Slovak defence industry, which will
improve the security and availability of supplies in war-time, the stability
and long-term sustainability of the life cycles of military hardware, support
economic growth of the Slovak Republic and domestic employment. New
products of the home defence industry utilised by the AF SR has better
prospects on foreign markets with synergetic returns for the Slovak economy.
In cases of projects co-sponsored by foreign partners, support will be given
to the utilisation of home defence industry capabilities in the realisation
phase of a project, with the possibility of extending it to the maintenance
and repair phase a of product. The Slovak defence industry will be involved
in research and development to ensure national defence.

218) In order to improve cooperation and communication between the
MoD and the Slovak defence industry, the _MoD - Security and Defence_
_Industry Association of the Slovak Republic Cooperation Agreement will be_
updated. With the involvement of this association and other relevant state
authorities, the creation of a strategic framework for the development of the
Slovak defence industry will be initiated.

219) Possibilities and economic advantages of international cooperation
in the area of key armament projects will be systematically identified, especially
with Visegrad Group countries and other NATO and EU member states.
This cooperation will be developed primarily in relation to the replacement
of obsolete soviet hardware and joint acquisitions of financially challenging
technologies. Services of NATO agencies and the European Defence
Agency will be utilised in the area of armament.

220) Use of off-the-shelf and dual-use technologies will also support the
effectiveness of resource utilisation in the area of armament.

## Infrastructure Development in the scope of the MoD


_The aim of developing infrastructure managed by the MoD is its_
_construction and maintenance in line with national defence needs. Emphasis_
_is to be placed on a gradual modernisation of the infrastructure of AF SR_
_formations and facilities, and also on infrastructure for their training while_
_effectively dispensing with finances, alongside common funding through_
_NSIP._

### 8.1 Basic State Property Management and Infrastructure Development Requirements


The stabilisation
of the network
of military installations
and the development
of infrastructure


230) Basic requirements placed on the management and accounting of
movable and immovable property managed by the MoD and on infrastructure
development will be:

- the stabilisation of the network of military installations, on the basis

of a revaluation of immovable asset requirements of assets managed by

the MoD (including of those assets declared redundant), so that

necessary capacities are maintained for professional soldiers and active

reservists until such time as the state is threatened by war or for the


purposes of HNS,

- adjust the extent of state movable and immovable assets managed by

the MoD to national defence needs,

- legal settlement of property-rights of installations, especially in the

vicinity of airfields,

- ensure transparency, economic efficiency and effective disposal of

redundant and expendable state property managed by the MoD,

- establishment of a unified database concerning infrastructure managed

by the MoD, based on MoD Integrated Information System modules,

- the establishment of modern and economically efficient infrastructure,

including the resolution of the problems concerning the condition

of buildings which do not meet technical norms and which have been


in disrepair for many years,


-----

- the development of infrastructure in connection with military

hardware and stock development based on AF SR requirements,

- make use of common funding through NSIP in the case of

infrastructure projects related to HNS, as well as the improvement of

the preparation and implementation of these projects.

### 8.2 Infrastructure Development Priorities

231) Development of infrastructure will be carried out in these priority
areas:

- the construction of basic airfield infrastructure, with emphasis placed

on the operation of new aviation equipment and the NATO Air

Command and Control System,

purposes of HNS in line with appropriate planning documents,

- the improvement of the energy efficiency of utilised buildings by

modernising their heating systems and insulation,

- ensure the protection of selected premises and facilities, as well as the

conditions for handling classified information (facility security),

- the construction of a high quality education and training base in

military training areas and barrack training grounds with an emphasis

placed on new methods of training and the interconnection of

simulation technology centres with an emphasis on unit training in

such conditions, which are close to the reality of the current battlefield.

The construction of the Training Centre - Lešť as a national centre for

training domestic and foreign armed and rescue corps will continue,

which will include a tactical field for mechanised units training,

- enhance the quality of life of personnel by modernising and repairing

administrative, housing, training, storage and social areas, with an aim

to improve their working conditions,

- contribution to the protection of the natural environment by repairing

buildings and modernising technical facilities, especially workshops

for vehicles, washing facilities for equipment, warehouses, fuel

dispensers, water resource management facilities and coal fuelled

heating plants.

### 8.3 Investment Phases

232) In phase I (between 2016 and 2020), infrastructure development
will be focused on airfield infrastructure (repair of buildings and running
surfaces of the Kuchyňa, Sliač and Prešov airfields) taking also into account


-----

its utilisation for HNS, and also on improving the energy efficiency of
buildings and the modernisation of heating units (particularly solid fuel
heating plants), the facility security of selected buildings (the modernisation
and installation of security systems), further development of the Training
Centre - Lešť (the repair and modernisation of the Combined Arms Tactical
Shooting Range) and the repair of facilities improving the quality of life of
personnel.

233) In phase II (between 2021 and 2030), the implementation of
infrastructure development projects launched in the first phase will be
continued and other projects will be implemented in priority areas, while
emphasis will be placed on the education and training base of training

## The National Defence Support System

_The aim of national defence support system development is to ensure_
_the preparation, maintenance and development of defence infrastructure and_
_to provide services, activities and the supply of goods to national defence._


The decisive precondition
of an effective National
Defence Support System
will be a coordinated
approach


### 9.1 The Basis of an Effective National Defence Support System

234) The National Defence Support System will be developed as part of
the system of national defence by means of defence planning. The decisive
precondition of an effective support system of national defence will be a
coordinated approach towards ensuring it by means of harmonising plans for
the purposes of national defence and crisis plans for economic mobilisation
of appropriate ministries, other central state administrative bodies and state
administrative bodies with a national scope of authority and entities subject
to economic mobilisation.


235) Defence infrastructure will be prepared, maintained and developed
in line with the long-term national defence support development plan,
while services and activities will be provided to AF SR according to
MoD requirements and plans of appropriate entities subject to economic
mobilisation for the purposes of national defence and HNS.

236) The MoD as a central state administrative body for national defence
management will also actively fulfil its coordination function in the area of
the National Defence Support System, especially by means of long and midterm plans, so that this support system can provide the AF SR with defence
capacities and capabilities they normally lack, and also that additional defence
capacities can be generated. This should be based on an analysis of both the
Support System and HNS.


237) Part of the National Defence Support System will also be a set of
economic, organisational activities and measures as elements of economic
mobilisation, which will ensure preparedness of the state for defence and


-----

the resolution of crisis situations, with an emphasis on supporting AF SR
activities concerned with national defence.

### 9.2 Defence Infrastructure

238) The preparation, maintenance and development of defence
infrastructure will be provided for by the MoD on the basis of AF SR
requirements (including HNS requirements) in cooperation with other
ministries, other central state administrative bodies and state administrative
bodies with a national scope of authority, while it keeps central records and
guides recordkeeping in the said ministries, state authorities and in the AF
SR.

239) In maintaining and developing defence infrastructure, emphasis will
be placed on the following areas:

- transport (maintaining required parameters of specified transport

networks),

- electronic communication networks, communication and information

systems including their protection, and also cyber-defence and cyber
protection infrastructure,

- energy and gas distribution networks (stockpiling and transport of

gas and petroleum, production and distribution of electricity and

petroleum products),

- central national defence management and AF SR command posts,

back-up posts for constitutional bodies,

- state material reserves infrastructure,

- water dispensation points, water sources and water industry facilities

for national defence needs,

- defence industry infrastructure.

240) Selection and introduction of defence infrastructure elements to
the category of Facilities of Special Importance or the category of Other
Important Facilities will be revaluated. The manner of protection and defence
of these facilities will be specified along with the criteria for the assignation
of Other Important Facilities in relation to the specification of Critical
Infrastructure and European Critical Infrastructure elements.

### 9.3 Services, Activities and Goods

241) Services and activities (for example medical and transport services,
construction) and the supply of goods are provided to the AF SR and other
executive components of the system of national defence within the scope of
economic mobilisation.


The preparation,
maintenance and
development of defence
infrastructure will be
provided for on the basis
of AF SR requirements


-----

An effective provision
of required services and
activities, production
capacities, state material
reserves and the supply
of goods for the AF SR


242) In the area of preparation, maintenance and development of services
and activities, efforts will be focused on the following:

- updating of requirements for the maintenance and the development

of services and activities for the AF SR, further elements of the system

of national defence and for the purposes of HNS,

- updating requirements for retaining production capacities in entities

subject to economic mobilisation, maintenance of state material

reserves for the AF SR (quantities and composition) including the

supply of goods planned for replacing losses and AF SR consumption,

- the identification of measures for an effective provision of required

services and activities, production capacities, state material reserves and

the supply of goods for the AF SR and additional elements of the

system of national defence, so that these will be either created,

maintained or provided for by means of appropriate contracts for

national defence needs.

### 9.4 The Focus of State Authorities in Supporting Defence

243) In the area of national defence support, state authorities will aim at the
following:

- The Ministry of the Interior on the gradual modernisation of the

back-up post from which the Government may carry out its activities,

with an emphasis on reaching its technical interoperability with the

appropriate NATO and EU C2 authorities.

- The Ministry of Transport, Construction and Regional

Development on ensuring the serviceability of transportation

networks, the construction and maintenance of related support gear

and the maintenance of an essential number of train cars and

locomotives for the support of the operational deployment

and employment of the AF SR on the territory of the Slovak Republic

and for the purposes of HNS, electronic communications services,

ensure the serviceability of emergency communications systems,

secure data storage, the undertaking of tasks in the area of frequency

management and providing favourable conditions for military postal

service.

- The Ministry of Health on the creation of a broadened sickbed

capacity to provide for national defence.

- The Ministry of the Economy on the replacement of AF SR losses

and consumption by ensuring production, the delivery of goods, as

well as the repair of military hardware by way of entities subject to

economic mobilisation.

- The State Material Reserves on providing the required quantity and

composition of state material reserves, including their regular

maintenance and augmentation, and also on the creation of an


-----

assortment of spare parts to enable the war-time overhaul of AF SR

equipment.

- The Ministry of the Environment on maintaining and servicing

water dispensation points, selected water sources and water industry

facilities to provide for national defence.

- The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development on providing

the required articles of food to provide for national defence.

- The Ministry of Labour, Social Affairs and the Family on taking

measures aimed at creating conditions for a stable social environment

and the organisation of social welfare in crisis situations.

## National Defence and the Public

_The aim in the area of communicating national defence and the_
_development of public relations is to maintain and strengthen trust in the_
_measures which are taken and prepared for national defence._


### 10.1 The Focus of Public Communication

244) In communicating national defence, emphasis will be placed on
strengthening the perception of national defence by the public as a matter
that involves everyone, on deepening patriotism and defence oriented
awareness in keeping with national and military traditions, as well as
on creating conditions for gaining the broadest possible political and
public support for long-term defence priorities, with an emphasis on the
development of the Armed Forces.


The purpose behind
communication is
to provide objective
information for the
formation of a positive
relationship of the public
towards national defence


245) Principles of active strategic communication will be applied, the
purpose behind which is to provide objective information for the formation
of a positive relationship of the public towards national defence and
the strengthening of public resilience in the face of misinformation and
propaganda of entities on home soil and abroad, directed against the security
interests of the Slovak Republic.

246) The quality of providing information and the effort to increase the
level of public understanding of tasks related to national defence will be
enhanced. The way to achieve this is by objectively communicating with the
public and by an overall development of public relations.


247) Communication with the public will primarily be aimed at
informing and explaining the following aspects of Slovak defence policy:

- preservation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Slovak

Republic and the inviolability of its borders,

- the importance of NATO and EU membership and the meeting of in

ternational commitments of the Slovak Republic, with an emphasis


-----

on commitments stemming from the treaty on collective defence

against attack,

- active participation of citizens on ensuring national defence, including

compulsory military service in war-time and other responsibilities in

relation to national defence,

- the mission of the AF SR in non-military emergencies on the territory

of the Slovak Republic.

248) The public will be given the account of threats, mainly in relation
to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Slovak Republic and the
inviolability of its borders, and also the needs of ensuring national defence
in a dynamically changing security environment, where either Slovakia or her
Allies may be exposed to threats relatively quickly (not excluding the causes of
threats that are far afield). As required, plans and measures will be presented,
which are undertaken in order to prevent, eliminate or decrease the effects
of threats and to maintain the security of the state. Part of communicating
defence matters to the public will also be the matter of defence spending and
what are the adequate resource needs of national defence.

249) As part of transparently communicating achieved results, the public
will also be informed about the problems which exist in the process of
carrying out tasks connected with national defence, while being adequately
informed about their resolution.

### 10.2 Developing Public Relations

250) The MoD will draft its own communication strategy in order to carry
out a meaningful and effective dialogue with key departmental and nondepartmental (both domestic and foreign) target groups.

251) In relation to departmental target groups, the priorities in this area will
be the fostering of national and military traditions, strengthening the sense
of comradeship and common interests of professional soldiers, employees,
pensioners, war veterans and their family members - for this purpose tools
will be utilised to provide the said groups with relevant information and
space for providing feedback.

252) In relation to non-departmental domestic target groups:

- to the public – priorities will be: to objectively inform and create

conditions for bringing the issues of providing national defence closer

to the public with the aim of ensuring a stable high level of confidence

of the public in the AF SR and to stimulate their interest in either

serving in the AF SR and their active reserves, or taking part in

voluntary military training.

- to the co-presenters of MoD’s positions (the media) – the priority

will be to offer objective, timely and balanced information,


Stimulate the interest
of citizens in either
serving in the AF SR
and their active reserves,
or taking part in
voluntary military
training


-----

professionally provided to the media with the aim of gaining their

support and cooperation in communicating with the public.

- to the political representatives, state administration and self
government authorities – the priority will be a deepening of their

knowledge concerning issues of national defence with the aim of

gaining their support for measures increasing the ability of the state to

defend itself. This will include measures increasing the preparedness

of the general population for national defence. Improving the

preparation of the general population for national defence will be

achieved primarily by a further development of national defence

education and training in primary and secondary schools, which will

require cooperation with the Ministry of Education, Science,

Research and Sports; the improvement of these preparations will also

be supported by an increased level of involvement of the AF SR by way

of lectures and other activities.

- to the third sector, non-profit, non-governmental organisations, the

academia and interest groups with a professional relationship with

the AF SR – the priority will be to actively communicate with the aim

of intensifying their cooperation with the AF SR in the area of

increasing the preparedness of the general population for national

defence, deepening defence awareness and fostering patriotism among

citizens and their pride in the AF SR, along with the fostering of national

and military traditions. Cooperation with these entities and the expert

community, the greatest contribution of which is to communicate

relevant information about national defence to the public, in

creating a platform for public discussion and in the drafting of analysis

and expert defence policy proposals, will be carried out on the principle

of constructiveness and a common interest to increase the support

of the public for enhancing the ability of the state to defend itself. In

communicating with interest groups with a professional relationship

with the AF SR, participated in by appropriate MoD and AF SR

entities, the possibility of utilising the deeper interest of their members

in the activities which have military uses will be taken into account.

This may take the form of joint activities and even active service in the

AF SR or their active reserves, not excluding their taking part in

voluntary military training.

253) In relation to foreign partners, primarily foreign media, the
representatives of international organisations and diplomats, the priority
will be to present Slovakia as a democratic state, respectful of international
law, prepared to defend itself and to meet its obligations, with the aim of
fostering an image of a reliable ally and a partner that is pro-European and
pro-NATO.

## The White Paper Implementation

TheWhite Paper on Defence of the Slovak Republic provides a politicostrategic framework for providing national defence, which will be elaborated
and implemented by additional documents in line with their purpose and
character. The methods of implementing the White Paper are based on a
gradual drafting or updating of strategic and conceptual documents that
are interconnected both in time and content. These will be translated into
amendments to national legislation. Practical results of the White Paper
implementation will be achieved by relevant documents pertaining to the
planning of national defence. The following key documents will be drafted
in line with the White Paper:
a) in the area of strategic documents:

- the _Defence Strategy of the Slovak Republic as a key strategic_

document in the area of national defence tying into the Security Strategy

_of the Slovak Republic, taking into account NATO’s strategic_

adaptation process and key circumstances of future EU development

with emphasis placed on the politico-military aspects of the _EU_

_Global Strategy on Foreign and Security Policy, will define the_

basic parameters of defence policy in the current and future security

environment with an emphasis on defining requirements for

improving the management and providing for national defence.

It will also define the politico-military ambition of the Slovak

Republic along with the requirements for AF SR capability

development including requirements concerning resourcing

arrangements. The Defence Strategy will provide the basis for the

drafting of a Military Strategy of the Slovak Republic (2017);
b) in the area of conceptual documents:

- the _System of National Defence Development Concept in line_

with the Defence Strategy will conceptually elaborate measures

improving the preparedness, management and providing for national

defence within the system of national defence, including the proposal

of amendments to national legislation dealing with national defence

(2017);
c) in the area of planning documents:

- the _Long-term AF SR Development Plan until 2030 will specify the_

content and schedule of steps to be taken in key areas of AF SR and

Military Police development (2016);
d) in the area of updating defence legislation:

- amendments to national legislation and internal regulations

concerning national defence, which update the legal framework of

national defence in the context of ensuring national defence in line with

the new strategic and conceptual framework of national defence

(2018).
