Message by the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade

With the growing public attention on foreign affairs and diplomacy, the
issues such as the adoption of the September 19 Joint Statement at the
Fourth Round of the Six-Party Talks, the successful hosting of the APEC
Economic Leaders’ Meeting, and a multi-track approach to FTAs were
among the top news items in 2005. This also demonstrates the public’s
heightened interest and expectations on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
and Trade.

To meet with the changing environment, the Ministry designated
2005 as the starting year of “Diplomacy with the People,” earnestly
endeavoring to gain the understanding and support of the people. On this
basis, the Ministry has exerted every possible effort to pave the way for lasting peace and prosperity on
the Korean Peninsula and in Northeast Asia.

In 2005, the Ministry demonstrated its creative diplomatic capabilities, playing a leading role in the
adoption of the September 19 Joint Statement which lays a basis for the peaceful resolution of the
North Korean nuclear issue and a peace regime on the Korean Peninsula. The Ministry has also
worked together with the United States to address long outstanding issues in a mutually beneficial
manner and develop the ROK-U.S. alliance into a more comprehensive and dynamic one. It took every
opportunity to build future-oriented relations with other neighboring countries as well.

Korea increased its contribution to the international community and support for developing countries, commensurate with its enhanced national capacity. Furthermore, it reaffirmed its leadership and
diplomatic capabilities with the successful hosting of the APEC Economic Leaders’ Meeting.

Striving to ensure a new engine for the continued growth of the Korean economy and cope with
the global trend of regional integration as well as economic liberalization, the Ministry has pursued
FTAs on a multi-track basis and participated in the WTO Doha Development Agenda (DDA) negotiations.

In the midst of the rapid expansion in overseas activities of Koreans, the need for higher-quality
consular services has been on the rise. Responding to the increased demand, the Ministry has expanded
its infrastructure and implemented organizational innovations for consular services.

The 2006 Diplomatic White Paper outlines the international situation and the accomplishments of a
year’s efforts by the Ministry and the people it serves. It gives me great pleasure to introduce this publication, which I hope will become the means for further realizing “Diplomacy with the People.” I look
to the people for their continued support for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, which is indeed
vital in our endeavors.

_December 2006_

### Overview

###### 1. The World in 2005

In 2005, with the United States playing a leading role in the reconstruction and stabilization of Iraq, a range of issues have been the focus of attention in the international
community. International terrorism and the non-proliferation of WMD, the North Korean and Iranian nuclear issues, and moves towards greater regional integration within the
European Union have featured high on the international agenda.
While maintaining its counter-terrorism and counter-proliferation policies, the U.S.
government has been rapidly responding to changes in the new security environment.
Such efforts include the prevention of terrorism and the non-proliferation of nuclear,
chemical and biological weapons through the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI), especially in the “Arc of Instability,”[1] and the continued pursuit of the Global Posture Review
(GPR). Moreover, to ensure stability and democracy in Iraq, the U.S. government has
also stepped up efforts to enhance multilateralism and strengthen cooperation with its
allies.

1 In 2001, the U.S. Department of Defense designated the region stretching from the
Middle East to Northeast Asia as the “Arc of Instability” in its Quadrennial Defense
Review (QDR). The 2001 QDR raised the possibility that states or non-state actors in
this area may be associated with global terrorism and thus may pose asymmetric
threats to global security. Arc of InstabilityArc of InstabilityA Ins bilitytytylit

Moreover, to effectively carry out its national security strategy, the U.S. government
has pursued so-called “Transformational Diplomacy.”[2] Such a step is a demonstration of
the U.S.’s unwavering commitment to the spread of freedom and democracy around the
globe.
Global actors including the EU, China and Russia are maintaining stable relations with
one another and cooperating with the U.S. in its war against terrorism, while actively
responding to issues with a bearing on their national strategic interests.
In the Middle East, with the post-war security concerns in Iraq, Iran’s nuclear
program, and the terrorist attacks in Egypt and Jordan, the region experienced continued
instability. Nonetheless, Iraq successfully established a new constitution and held general
elections, while developments toward democracy taking place in other nations such as
Lebanon, Egypt and Kuwait. In addition, the Middle East has taken steps to promote
interaction among its nations through regional organizations and confidence-building
with other regions, for example through the Asia-Middle East Dialogue.
The relationship between Israel and Palestine, another main axis in the region’s peace
and stability, evidenced both bright and dark aspects. In January 2005, Mahmoud Abbas
won the Palestinian presidency through democratic elections and in February the two
sides were able to resume peace talks after a four-year interval at the Sharm el-Sheikh
Summit in Egypt. However, with Hamas’s victory in the Palestinian election in January
2006, prospects for peace between the two sides seem uncertain.
The rapid rise of BRICs[3] is expected to bring changes in relations among major
nations. India, in particular, with its 8% economic growth rate over the past three years,
rising geopolitical importance, and prospects for reconciliation and cooperation with
Pakistan, is being perceived as having strategic value, making it the focus of attention
amongst major powers, including the U.S. and Russia.
Central Asia is assuming increasing strategic importance in the region due to its proximity to China and Russia and rich natural resources. On the other hand, there is growing

2 “Transformation Diplomacy” is a new catchphrase by the U.S. Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice. She used the term when she called upon U.S.
Diplomats to make every effort for the spread of freedom and democracy, which President Bush emphasized in his second inaugural address on
January 20, 2005.

3 An economic term used to refer to the newly emerging economies—Brazil, Russia, India and China—that have achieved rapid economic growth in
the 2000s. The term was first used in a report by the investment bank, Goldman Sachs in 2003. Economists predict that these economies may
become the most dominant economies by the year 2030.

concerns over the possibility that the region would emerge as an operational base for
terrorist organizations and the trade in drugs and illicit weapons as well as human trafficking after the war in Afghanistan.
The year 2005 was characterized by active regional cooperation and integration
throughout the world. In the case of Asia, due to the cultural and ethnic diversity as well
as differences in political systems between the countries of the region, the level of integration in other fields remained rather low compared to the economic field. However,
efforts to step up regional cooperation have been strengthened focussing around
ASEAN+3. During the first East Asia Summit (EAS), which was held in Kuala Lumpur in
December, the participating leaders declared that the EAS could play a significant role in
community building in East Asia and made clear their commitment to reinforce regional
cooperation.
The EU has been exerting efforts for the expansion of its membership and in that
regard held membership negotiations with Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia, and Turkey. It
also encouraged member countries to ratify the EU Constitution, which was adopted in

Chapter 1. Overview | 17


-----

June 2004. However, with the negative outcomes of the referendum in France and the
Netherlands on the EU Constitution, there have been setbacks in the ratification itself as
well as the process of political integration.
In the field of multilateral diplomacy, with the release in December 2004 of the UN
High-Level Panel Report, setting out ways to cope with international security threats and
recommendations on UN reform in general, the UN Security Council reform in particular, the reform of the United Nations was high on the agenda of the international
community throughout 2005. On the occasion of the 60[th] Session of the UN General
Assembly in September 2005, an Outcome Document was adopted by the World
Summit encompassing elements which span the values and principles of the UN; cooperation for the development of developing countries; peace and security; human rights and
the rule of law; and strengthening the role of the UN.
With the 7[th] Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT)[4] Review Conference in May
2005 having failed to reach substantial agreement, the nuclear non-proliferation regime is
facing a crisis. In addition, the delays and stalemate in the efforts to resolve the Iranian
and North Korean nuclear issues have also been a destabilizing factor in the international
situation.

###### 2. The World Economy in 2005

The world economy, despite numerous challenges including the high oil and commodity
prices, expanded at a mid-four precent growth rate in 2005 due to the favorable conditions in the U.S. economy and the robust performance of emerging market economies,
China in particular.
Despite the impact of Hurricane Katrina and the Federal Reserve Board’s raising of
the interest rate, the U.S. economy was able to achieve a growth rate of 3.5% mainly due
to the increase in private sector consumption expenditure and the construction boom.

4 An agreement that entered into force in March 1970. It seeks to prevent nuclear-weapon states from transferring nuclear weapons or other nuclear
explosive devices to non-nuclear-weapon states, and non-nuclear states from developing nuclear weapons. As of 2005, 188 countries are parties to
the NPT including Korea, the U.S. and Russia. North Korea ratified the treaty on December 12, 1985 but withdrew on January 10, 2003.

But the U.S. has continued to show twin deficits, namely fiscal and trade deficits, since
2004. The U.S. budget deficit dropped sharply from 3.6% in 2004 to 2.6% of total GDP,
while its trade deficit rose from 5.9% to 6.4% of GDP.
The Japanese economy, thanks to resilient consumer spending and growing investment leading to greater employment, showed signs of recovery by turning around to
achieve a 2.6% growth rate. Such favorable signs indicate that the post-bubble adjustment
is coming to an end in Japan.
China’s economy continued to record a 9.9% annual growth in 2005 with the constant
increase in investment and consumption. Although China shifted to a floating exchange
rate system and revalued its currency by 2.1% to 8.11 yuan to the U.S. dollar on 21 July,
its exports remained unaffected.
In the Euro zone, the rejection of the EU Constitution in France and the Netherlands,
and uncertainties over the delayed structural reform weakened investment and consumer
confidence. Nonetheless, the economies picked up pace in the second half of the year to
record 1.3% growth.
The 2005 hike in oil prices, which was considered one of the major elements threatening the international economy, resulted from an imbalance between supply and demand.
While oil demand surged due to China’s increasing consumption and the sound world
economy, OPEC’s surplus production capacity fell to 1.5 million barrels per day. Other
factors such as the lack of refining facilities and concerns over geopolitical insecurity in
the Middle East have influenced the oil prices. Yet, with the development of alternative
energy sources which has reduced the dependency on oil, consumer confidence in low
inflation, and oil money spending by oil-producing countries, the impact of the oil price
surge was not significant compared to the oil shocks in the 1970s.
The WTO Doha Development Agenda (DDA) negotiations, with the aim of creating
a new world trade order, failed to reach an agreement at the WTO Ministerial Conference in Cancún (2003). However, the dialogue was resumed in 2004 and Mini-Ministerial
Meetings were held every two months in 2005 in an attempt to seek a breakthrough on
key controversial issues.
Whilst difficulties were experienced in the multilateral approach, many countries,
preparing against the possibility of the failure to come to an agreement in the DDA negotiations, sought to strengthen regional mechanism to complement multilateralism and
serve as a new engine of growth.
The Asian region in particular stood out amongst other regions for the marked

Chapter 1. Overview | 19

increase in activities in the pursuit of FTAs—not only did countries in the region actively
pursue FTAs with Asia and the Americas but also with other regions, including Oceania.
Moreover, following the conclusion of the China-ASEAN FTA, which came into effect in
July 2005, other countries in the region have hastened to fully embark on negotiations to
conclude FTAs with ASEAN.

###### 3. The Korean Peninsula and Northeast Asia in 2005

In 2005, while the Northeast Asian countries seeking a new security order in the region,
tensions over perceptions of history and territorial disputes intensified.
The North Korean nuclear issue remained the greatest factor of instability in the
region. The fourth round of Six-Party Talks was resumed after a thirteen month hiatus,
resulting in the adoption of the September 19 Joint Statement. The Statement, which sets
out the principles agreed by the parties, is seen as having laid the groundwork for the
peaceful resolution of the North Korean nuclear issue.
The U.S. government took a financial measure on Banco Delta Asia (BDA) in Macau
suspecting that the BDA provided Pyongyang with money laundering services for the
funds acquired from the North’s illicit activities. Hence, the fifth round of Six-Party Talks
recessed only with positions of each side out on the table, short of substantial progress.
North Korea refused to return to the Talks unless the U.S. lifted the measure, while the
U.S. emphasized that the measures were for law-enforcement and a separate matter from
the nuclear issue.
In the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the U.S. has focused its strategic efforts on
effectively dealing with non-traditional security threats such as terrorism and WMD
proliferation. As part of such efforts, the U.S. has strengthened security partnerships with
its Asia-Pacific allies, including Korea, Australia, Singapore and the Philippines. In particular, in May 2005, the U.S. agreed with Australia and Japan to launch the U.S.-AustraliaJapan Trilateral Strategic Dialogue by pulling together their U.S.-Australia alliance and
U.S.-Japan alliance. During the U.S.-Japan Security Consultative Committee (the 2+2
Meeting) in October 2005, the two sides adopted an interim report,[5] detailing a concrete
schedule for the implementation of the Global Posture Review. Through such steps,

20 |  2006 Diplomatic White Paper


-----

Japan has actively explored ways to expand its role in the international community, while
agreeing with the U.S. to expand the scope of the U.S.-Japan alliance to a global level to
cope with security threats together.
The economic interdependence between China and Japan is constantly deepening,
with the trade volume between the two countries reaching 184.4 billion dollars. However, tensions have continued with Prime Minister Koizumi’s visits to the Yasukuni Shrine,
territorial disputes over the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands and the development of energy
resources in the East China Sea.
In tandem with its economic development, China, while maintaining its traditional
policy of creating a stable security environment, actively pursued pragmatic and multidimensional diplomacy in 2005. Based on its cooperative relations with the U.S. in
counter-terrorism and counter-proliferation, China has endeavored to advance its strategic cooperative partnership with the U.S. In this context, China has made full use of
opportunities to strengthen dialogue with the U.S. on various occasions, including the
first U.S.-China Senior Dialogue in August; the UN Summit in September; U.S. Secretary
of Defense Rumsfeld’s visit to China in October; and U.S. President Bush’s visit to China
in November.
China-Taiwan relations were characterized by both tension and cooperation. In
February 2005, the two sides agreed to operate direct flights between the mainland and
the island, but tension arose again after China passed the Anti-Secession Law in March
2005. In response, Taiwanese President Chen Shuibian declared the abolition of the
National Unification Council and its guidelines in January 2006. China took it as a step
toward Taiwan’s independence and intensified diplomatic efforts to deter such a move.
Russia, while continuing its reforms for national development, further tightened
counter-terrorism measures. In addition, Russia has enhanced its cooperation with China
in various fields such as counter-terrorism and non-proliferation, security cooperation in
the areas bordering Central Asia, the Far East and Siberia, and curbing secessionist movements. To this end, Russia and China discussed plans for bilateral or international cooperation on many occasions, including the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO)[6]

5 The report outlines measures such as the realignment of U.S. Marine Corps Forces in Okinawa, the transfer of approximately 7,000 Marine officers
and enlisted personnel, strengthening coordination improvements in the Ballistic Missile Defense systems and humanitarian relief operations.

6 An intergovernmental forum founded in 2001 for the purpose of strengthening mutual trust and good-neighborly relations among member states;
building cooperative relations; security and stability in the region. The People’s Republic of China, Russian Federation, Republic of Kazakhstan,
Republic of Kyrgyzstan, Republic of Tajikistan and Republic of Uzbekistan are currently member states of the organization.

Summit in July 2005, the China-Russia Annual Summit in July (Moscow), and the UN
Summit in September.
North Korea, in the midst of tensions with the U.S., has actively worked to improve
its ties with China and Russia. North Korea has been seeking to strengthen its friendship
and economic cooperation with China and Russia through numerous exchanges of visits
including the visit to the North by Wang Jiarui, the Head of the International Liaison
Department of the Chinese Communist Party, in February 2005; the visit to China by
North Korea’s Prime Minister Park Pong-ju and First Vice Foreign Minister Kang Suk-ju
in March; and Chinese President Hu Jintao’s visit to Pyongyang in October.
The year 2005 paved the way for promoting multilateral security cooperation in
Northeast Asia. With the adoption of the September 19 Joint Statement at the Six-Party
Talks, an agreement was reached for the first time on exploring ways and means to
promote security cooperation in Northeast Asia. This was a meaningful step in terms of
allowing in-depth discussion of multilateral security cooperation in Northeast Asia at the
official level.
There was also substantial progress in the activities led by bodies aiming for regional
cooperation in the Asia-Pacific such as APEC, ASEAN+3, the EAS and ASEAN Regional
Forum (ARF). The first EAS in Kuala Lumpur in particular provided a venue for largescale multilateral diplomacy in the region. However, the Korea-China-Japan Summit,
scheduled to be held on the sidelines of the ASEAN+3 Summit, was postponed indefinitely as Japanese Prime Minister Koizumi made another visit to the Yasukuni Shrine,
despite the official protests by Korea and China.

### Peaceful Resolution of the North Korean Nuclear Issue

###### 1. The Resumption of the Six-Party Talks

After the third round of the Six-Party Talks in June 2004, with its passive attitude, North
Korea continued to delay the fourth round of the Talks. In particular, in early 2005,
North Korea took various steps which aggravated the situation. On February 10, in a
Statement by the Foreign Ministry, North Korea declared its possession of nuclear
weapons, and stated that it would indefinitely postpone its participation in the Six-Party
Talks. It went further to demand that the U.S. apologize for referring to the North as an
“Outpost of Tyranny” and withdraw the comment. At the end of March, in an official
memorandum by the Foreign Ministry Spokesperson, the North stated that the Six-Party
Talks should be transformed into nuclear disarmament talks. In May, the North also
announced that it had completed the extraction of spent fuel rods from its 5MWe reactor
at Yongbyun.
The Korean government expressed serious concerns over such moves of the North. In
an assessment that such actions purport to strengthen its position in future negotiations,
the government continued to make efforts to stably manage the situation and resume the
Six-Party Talks in cooperation with the parties concerned, while firmly adhering to the
three principles of: - zero-tolerance of the possession of nuclear weapons by North
Korea ▲ the peaceful resolution of the North Korean nuclear issue through dialogue ▲

active role of Korea in the
process.
In this regard, the government, in close cooperation with
the U.S. and China, actively
strived to foster a favorable
atmosphere and proposed various measures for the resumption of the Six-Party Talks,

Opening Ceremony of the Fourth Round of the Six-Party Talks (Beijing, July 26,

while consulting with the 2005)
parties concerned to refrain
from overreacting. In response, Washington also made efforts for the resumption of
negotiations and alleviation of North Korea’s negative perception by expressing its readiness to hold bilateral talks with the North within the framework of the Six-Party Talks
process as well as referring to the North as a “sovereign state.”
Through summit meetings with China (May 9) and the U.S. (June 10), a range of bilateral and multilateral consultations, including various Foreign Ministers’ meetings and
consultations between the Heads of Delegation to the Six-Party Talks, Korea persistently
persuaded the North to refrain from any further steps that might exacerbate the situation,
and to return to the Talks. In tandem with such efforts, Korea actively sought to carry on
the Talks through inter-Korean dialogue, including the Special Presidential Envoy’s visit
to the North in June to convey the proposal on electrical power transmission.[1] As a result,
the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Christopher Hill and
North Korea’s Vice Foreign Minister Kim Gye-gwan met in Beijing on July 9, where the
North promised to return to the Talks.

1 The proposal is that while the construction of the Shinpo LWR will cease, if North Korea agrees on nuclear dismantlement in the Six-Party Talks,
Seoul will provide 2 million kW of electricity to the North equivalent to the capacity of the Shinpo LWR (aiming to achieve North Korea’s nuclear
dismantlement and complete construction of facilities related to electrical power transmission within three years, once the agreement on nuclear
dismantlement is concluded).

###### 2. The Fourth Round of the Six-Party Talks: Outcomes

1) September 19 Joint Statement

On July 26, the Six-Party Talks were resumed, as the first session of the fourth round
convened in Beijing from July 26 to August 7, 2005. All participating countries were
engaged in a serious and focused discussion with determined manner to continue the
negotiations without any pre-arranged concluding date until an agreement was reached.
As a result, they agreed on the need to adopt a joint document setting out the goals and
principles of the Six-Party Talks. They also achieved a concurrence of views on most of
the points in the document, including the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, security guarantees for North Korea and the normalization of relations. The Six Parties, maintaining the momentum from the first session, reconvened at the second session on
September 13-19 and concentrated on coordinating views on key issues. Finally, they
adopted the Joint Statement on September 19 unanimously.

**Summary of the September 19 Joint Statement**

1) Realizing verifiable denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and addressing North Korea’s security
concerns

            - The DPRK committed to abandoning all nuclear weapons and existing nuclear programs and returning,

6) Agreement to hold the fifth round of the Six-Party Talks in Beijing in early November 2005


In the Joint Statement, North Korea committed to abandoning all nuclear weapons
and existing nuclear programs and returning, at an early date, to the Treaty on the NonProliferation of Nuclear Weapons and to IAEA safeguards.
In return, other parties, including the U.S., undertook to take steps to normalize their
relations with the North and to promote economic cooperation including energy assistance. In addition, the parties agreed that the directly related parties would negotiate a
permanent peace regime on the Korean Peninsula at an appropriate separate forum and
explore ways and means to promote security cooperation in Northeast Asia.
The September 19 Joint Statement is regarded as having laid an initial foundation for
the resolution of the North Korean nuclear issue. Moreover, as the statement also
comprehensively reflects the major concerns of North Korea—the normalization of relations, security assurances and economic assistance—it will provide an opportunity for
North Korea to open itself up to and become a responsible member of the international
community through the implementation of the Joint Statement.
Moreover, the Joint Statement addressed matters beyond the North Korean nuclear
issue, including easing tensions and removing the Cold War structure on the Korean
Peninsula. Thus, it has laid the groundwork for cooperation for peace and security in
Northeast Asia, which, unlike other regions, has suffered from a lack of security coopera

tion structure.
Not only the participants in the Six-Party Talks but indeed the international community
welcomed the adoption of the Joint Statement, and international concerns over the
security environment on the Korean Peninsula were eased subsequently.[2]

2) Korea’s Active Role in the Adoption of the Joint Statement

The adoption of the Joint Statement is a collective achievement of the strenuous diplomatic efforts President Roh Moo-hyun’s “Participatory Government” has consistently
made, in cooperation with the international community, based on the three principles
regarding the resolution of the North Korean nuclear issue. Over the last two years,
Korea has played an active role regarding the North Korean nuclear issue including
summit diplomacy with the U.S., China, Japan and Russia. It has also exerted efforts at
the inter-Korean level to achieve the
resumption of the Talks, such as the
proposal of provision of 2 million kW of
electricity to North Korea on July 12.
During the fourth round of the SixParty Talks, held in Beijing after the 13
month hiatus, Korea exerted active and
creative diplomatic efforts throughout
the negotiations. Even though there
were moments of crisis due to widely
diverging positions among the parties,
Korean delegation persisted in its opposi- Foreign Minister Ban Ki-moon and U.S. Secretary of State Rice in

tion to a recess until the draft was Six-Party Talks (Washington, August 23, 2005)

2 With the substantial and tangible results from the Six-Party Talks, including the adoption of the September 19 Joint Statement, international rating
agencies such as S&P and Fitch upgraded Korea’s sovereign rating, thereby enhancing international confidence in Korea. As a result, it is expected
that conditions will be improved for Korea to attract greater foreign investment and foreign capital.

The second session of the fourth round (September 13-19) overlapped with the visits
by President Roh Moo-hyun (September 14-16) and his Foreign Minister (September 1720) to the United Nations and the inter-Korean Ministerial Talks in Pyongyang (September 13-16). Korea made use of these opportunities to consult and cooperate with the
parties concerned to achieve progress in the Talks. In particular, Foreign Minister Ban Kimoon had seven phone conversations and meetings with the U.S. Secretary of State
Condoleezza Rice, and more than ten times with his counterparts of China and Japan in
order to reach final agreement in the Joint Statement. Conducting multi-dimensional
diplomacy linking Beijing, New York, Pyongyang and Seoul, during the second session of
the fourth round of the Six-Party Talks, Korea served as a driving force to finalize the
Joint Statement.

###### 3. The First Session of the Fifth Round of the Six-Party Talks

1) Keeping the Momentum

With the adoption of the September 19 Joint Statement, the follow-up task for the Six
Parties was to agree on an implementation plan for denuclearization and corresponding
measures, such as the timetable, means and procedures. The first session of the fifth
round of the Talks was held in Beijing (November 9-11) to negotiate the implementation
of the Joint Statement. In the session, the delegations set forth their respective ideas and
positions on how to implement the Joint Statement, providing an opportunity to gain a
better understanding of each other’s positions through active exchange of views.
Despite difficulties due to the North’s raising of the financial measure taken by the
U.S. on the North’s illicit activities, the participating parties reconfirmed their shared
commitment to the Six-Party process, producing a Chairman’s Statement. In the Statement, they reaffirmed their support for the full implementation of the Joint Statement,
and agreed to formulate concrete plans, measures and steps for the implementation and
hold the next session “at the earliest possible date.”
Meanwhile, the Leaders at the 2005 APEC Economic Leaders’ Meeting in Busan
(November 18-19) agreed to issue a Chairman’s oral statement welcoming the September
19 Joint Statement and encouraging its faithful implementation—President Roh Moohyun, as the Chair, presented it.
In addition, on the occasion of the APEC Summit, Korea reconfirmed the international community’s full support for the peaceful resolution of the North Korean nuclear
issue and the Six-Party Talks, through bilateral summits and ministerial meetings with
the four participating parties in the Six-Party Talks—the U.S., China, Japan, and Russia—
and other multilateral fora.

**Summary of Chairman’s Statement of the Fifth Round of the Six-Party Talks**

         - The Parties reaffirmed that they would fully implement the Joint Statement for the verifiable

2) The Banco Delta Asia Issue

Since the first session of the fifth round, North Korea has raised the issue of a financial
measure taken by the U.S. on its illicit activities and has insisted that it would not attend
the Six-Party Talks until the issue is resolved.
This issue arose when the U.S. Department of the Treasury designated the bank in
question as the “primary money laundering concern” under Section 311 of the Patriot
Act.[3] Such measures gave rise to fears over the insolvency of the BDA and depositors
simultaneously withdrew their funds, causing a bank-run. Consequently, the Macao
authorities blocked all withdrawals and the North Korean bank accounts in the BDA
were frozen.
The United States has urged North Korea to unconditionally return to the Six-Party
Talks, maintaining that such financial measures were to protect its national interest from
illicit activities and a non-negotiable issue of law enforcement, irrelevant to the Six-Party
Talks.
Regarding this issue, Korea has maintained the position that  - it shares grave
concerns over North Korea’s illicit activities ▲ North Korea should take necessary steps
to resolve the suspicions of the international community ▲ such issues should not hinder
the Six-Party Talks process ▲ the Six-Party Talks should be promptly resumed without
precondition. Under such position, Korea is working closely with other participants—the
U.S., China, Japan and Russia for the early resumption of the Talks.
Meanwhile, recognizing not only the resumption but also substantial progress of the
Talks is significant, the Korean government is continuously making all its efforts and
working closely with countries concerned to foster a favorable atmosphere for the
progress of the Talks and undertaking of the implementation of the Joint Statement.
On the basic stance that the position of the Korean government, as a party directly
concerned in the North Korean nuclear issue, should be fully respected and reflected in
the negotiating process, the Korean government will continue to strengthen its cooperation with the U.S., China, Japan and Russia as well as make good use of the inter-Korean
dialogue and cooperation based on the development of inter-Korean relations.

3 Under Section 311 of the U.S.A Patriot Act, it is possible to designate financial institutions with terrorist associations as of ‘primary money laundering
concern’, preventing U.S. financial institutions from engaging in transactions with the institution in question, and enabling the confiscation of its U.S.
accounts. The U.S. Department of the Treasury has designated Banco Delta Asia as of ‘primary money laundering concern’ on the grounds that BDA
has been supporting illicit activities through money laundering for over 20 years.

### Developing a Future-oriented ROK-U.S. Alliance Relationship

###### 1. Toward Strategic Partnership

Since the Participatory Government came into office, the Republic of Korea and the United States have continued to promote their bilateral relations based on the spirit of the
alliance, shared values of democracy, human rights, and free market economy, and
mutual trust.
In 2005, President Roh Moo-hyun
and U.S. President George W. Bush
held two bilateral summit meetings.
During the summit meetings, the two
heads of state discussed major pending
issues such as the North Korean nuclear
issue and other matters of mutual interest. They also had the opportunity to
discuss ways to promote the friendly
and cooperative relations between the
two countries.
During the bilateral summit meeting held in Washington D.C. on June ROK-U.S. Summit Meeting (Gyeongju, November 17, 2005)

11, President Roh enhanced mutual understanding on pressing challenges concerning the
ROK-U.S. alliance and facilitated the negotiation process for the North Korean nuclear
issue. Through his efforts, President Roh greatly contributed to resuming the long-stalled
negotiations process for the Six-Party Talks which resumed in September 2005 after a
year-long suspension.
When President Bush visited Korea to attend the APEC Economic Leaders’ Meeting
in Busan, the two leaders held the ROK-U.S. Summit meeting in Gyeongju on November
17. During the Summit, the two leaders had in-depth discussions on regional and international issues, discussed ways to enhance bilateral trade and economic cooperation, and
exchanged views on the issue of peace on the Korean Peninsula. Furthermore, they
signed the “Gyeongju Declaration” (Joint Declaration on ROK-U.S. alliance and Peace on
the Korean Peninsula), which is an agreement that reflects their extensive discussion.
This Joint Declaration serves as a significant milestone for the further development of a
more comprehensive, dynamic and mutually beneficial Korea-U.S. relationship.
In the Gyeongju Summit, the two leaders also agreed to launch the Strategic Consultation for Allied Partnership in an additional effort to solidify Korea-U.S. relations, alongside the Security Consultative Meeting.
In 2005, in addition to the summit meeting, Korea and the U.S. have been actively
engaged in high-level exchanges which include ministerial dialogues. Foreign Minister
Ban and U.S. Secretary of State Rice held eight ministerial meetings including exchange
visits and multilateral meetings. In particular, Foreign Minister Ban had several opportunities to work closely with Secretary
Rice and other Foreign Ministers from
the countries involved in the Six-Party
Talks on the occasion of the 60[th] UN
Summit held in New York on September 17-18, 2005. The Summit
contributed to concluding an agreement on conflicting issues, such as the
issue of light-water reactors at the ongoing Six-Party Talks in Beijing.

ton to hold the first ministerial level
meeting of the Strategic Consultation
for Allied Partnership with Secretary
Rice on January 19, 2006. The two highlevel diplomats, Minister Ban and Secretary Rice, welcomed the successful
launching of the dialogue as it offered a
great opportunity for both countries to
resolve pressing challenges concerning

bility of U.S. forces in Korea, defense

They pledged to work for further development of comprehensive, dynamic, and mutually beneficial Korea-U.S. relations and adopted a joint statement highlighting the
significance of their first ministerial-level Strategic Consultations.
Through the Strategic Consultation for Allied Partnership, the two countries reaffirmed the ROK-U.S. alliance as a key strategic partnership based on the common values
of democracy and market economy. Moreover, the Consultation laid the foundation for
building a mature partnership between the two countries, thereby allowing the two
countries to have in-depth discussions on comprehensive issues including regional and
international issues on a mid- to long-term basis.
Meanwhile, acknowledging the increasing importance in public diplomacy and the
growing role and voice of domestic opinion leaders in foreign policy-making and implementation process, the Participatory Government has made efforts to reach out, not only
to government officials, but also to the opinion leaders in the Congress, the academia and
media and explain Korea’s position in various issues including the ROK-U.S. alliance,
strategic flexibility of U.S. forces in Korea, and the North Korean nuclear standoff, as a
way to enhance understanding of Korea’s foreign policy.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade is working hard to join the U.S. Visa Waiver Program to allow Korean nationals to travel within the U.S. for a limited time without
a U.S. Visa, as a way to expand and strengthen cooperation and exchanges between
Korea and the U.S. The government is working to meet the statutory requirement needed to be eligible for VWP status. It is particularly focusing in enhancing law enforcement
cooperation with the U.S. There is wide recognition within the U.S. Congress that Korea

of Koreans in the U.S. Moreover, the passage of the two resolutions reflects the growing
interest and awareness of Korea in the U.S. Congress.

###### 2. Progress in Current Issues

The year 2005 witnessed a progress in major issues concerning the ROK-U.S. alliance,
namely the issues of the realignment of U.S. forces in Korea (USFK), defense burden sharing, and relocation of the U.S. Embassy.

1) ROK-U.S. Security Policy Initiative

To adapt to the changes of the new security environment, Korea and the U.S. have held
twelve meetings of the Future of the Alliance Policy Initiatives (FOTA) from January
2003 to September 2004. Previous FOTA meetings have produced mutually beneficial
results in matters concerning the readjustment of U.S. forces in Korea, including the relocation of the Yongsan Garrison, realignment of the USFK, transfer of military missions
and responsibilities, and enhancement of ROK-U.S. combined capabilities.
At the 36[th] Security Consultative Meeting (SCM) in October 2004, the two sides
agreed to launch the Security Policy Initiative (SPI), replacing FOTA to discuss ways to
further promote the future ROK-U.S. alliance. Since the launching of the SPI, a total of
seven meetings were held between the two sides from February 2005 to April 2006.
Through SPI consultations, both nations reviewed the progress of the implementation
of the agreements made earlier at FOTA and discussed ways to establish a long-term
blueprint for the future direction of the ROK-U.S. alliance, such as the Joint Study on the

vision of the ROK-U.S. alliance, in order to respond to the changing security environment, SPI consultations, which are held between the foreign and defense ministries of the
two sides, have served as an effective security forum for resolving pending issues
concerning the alliance. Based on the successful outcome of the previous SPI consultations, both sides have continued to hold bilateral discussions on issues concerning the
ROK-U.S. alliance in 2006.

2) Defense Burden Sharing

Since 1991, the Korean government, in consideration of the significance and strategic
value of the USFK and Korea’s need to increase its military role commensurate with its
economic development, has shouldered a portion of the stationing costs of the USFK in
accordance with the Special Measures Agreement Relating to Article V of the Status of
Forces Agreement (SOFA Special Agreement). In the past, the Ministry of Defense represented Korea in negotiations concerning defense costs. However, MOFAT recently
represented the Korean government in the 6[th] Special Measures Agreement covering
2005 and 2006. Under close consultations with related agencies including the Ministry of
Defense, MOFAT held five high-level talks and numerous working-level negotiations.
Ultimately, MOFAT concluded a new Special Measures Agreement with its U.S. counterpart in April 2005 and received the approval of the National Assembly in June.
In this agreement, Korea agreed to provide the USFK with a two-year annual contribution of 680.4 billion Korean won in 2005 and 2006, which is an 8.9% decrease from the
previous year. With this result, MOFAT decreased the amount of cost sharing for the first
time while providing an appropriate level of defense costs that ensures a sustainable
stationing environment for U.S. forces in Korea.
The 6[th] Special Measures Agreement achieved reasonable and equitable cost-sharing
goals reflecting various situations on the Korean Peninsula, such as USFK troop reduction
and realignment as well as Korean troop deployment in Iraq. It is expected to provide
stable stationing environment for the USFK, thus contributing to the enhancement of
their combined defense posture and reinforcing mutual understanding and confidence
between the two nations.

Chapter 2. Developing a Future-oriented ROK-U.S. Alliance Relationship | 47

3) Strategic Flexibility of U.S. Forces in Korea

In February 2005, the two governments made a decision to fully address the strategic flexibility of U.S. forces in Korea. After several consultations, both sides reached an agreement on the following two items as stipulated in the Joint statement of the ROK-U.S.
ministerial-level strategic dialogue (January 19, 2006):

###### • The Republic of Korea, as an ally, fully understands the rationale for the transformation
of the United States global military strategy, and respects the necessity for strategic flexibility of U.S. forces in ROK;

###### • In the implementation of strategic flexibility, the United States respects the ROK position that it shall not be involved in a regional conflict in Northeast Asia against the will
of the Korean people.

This agreement equally reflected the opinions of both sides and has been assessed as
the provision that serves as a basis for further strengthening the ROK-U.S. alliance so that
the two countries can effectively respond to the changing security environment in the 21[st]

century.

4) The Realignment of U.S. Forces in Korea

The two countries concluded an agreement on the realignment of the U.S. forces in
Korea by signing two agreements on the relocation of Yongsan Garrison and the
revised Land Partnership Plan (LPP) in October 2004. Both agreements entered into
force in December 2004 by the Korean National Assembly’s approval. After the two
agreements were effectuated, the two countries reviewed the progress that has been
made in the implementation of the agreements at the SPI consultations and concluded
the EMOU (Engineering Memorandum of Understanding) and Cost Management
Procedure in July and August, respectively. It is expected that successful relocation of
the USFK will lead to efficient use of land and improve the stationing environment for
U.S. forces, hence, strengthening the combined ROK-U.S. defense posture. The Korean
government will continue to take various follow-up measures to ensure the successful
implementation of the relocation.

48 | 2006 Diplomatic White Paper

5) Relocation of the U.S. Embassy

The relocation of the U.S. Embassy has
continued to be a significant issue
because of the gratuitous occupation of
land and the issue of the protection of
Korean cultural properties within USFK
facilities (e.g. Deoksugung Palace).
After close consultations with related
agencies, the government concluded an
MOU for the relocation of the U.S.

Exchanging MOUs for the relocation of the U.S. Embassy (Seoul,

Embassy with the U.S. on July 12, 2005. July 12, 2005)
The MOU provides important principles and conditions required to complete the relocation, enabling the restoration of
historic cultural sites such as Deoksugung Palace and the Road of Agwanpachun. Moreover, the MOU has found ways to resolve the issue of returning Non-DOD facilities and
areas at Yongsan Garrison to the Korean government. As follow-up measures, Korea is
currently working on an agreement with the U.S. to adopt subsequent amendments
regarding specific details such as Site Exchange Agreement.

###### 3. For the Improved Implementation of the ROK-U.S. SOFA

The government has made continuous efforts to improve the process of the implementation of the ROK-U.S. Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) to minimize public inconvenience in hosting American forces and provide a stable environment for the posting of
U.S. forces in Korea. In 2005, Korea and the U.S. reorganized the Special Task Force,
which has been operating since 2002, into the Special Joint Committee with a view to
improving the implementation of the ROK-U.S. SOFA, thereby establishing another
regular consultative forum in addition to the existing ROK-U.S. SOFA Joint Committee
and Subcommittees.
The Korean government has engaged in consultations and focused on resolving pend

ing SOFA issues on numerous occasions, including the 184[th] ROK-U.S.
SOFA Joint Committee Meeting (July 7,
2005), two Special Joint Committee
Meetings and various Subcommittee
Meetings. In particular, to better
preserve and manage Korean cultural
assets located within USFK installations,

The 184[th] ROK-U.S. SOFA Joint Committee Meeting (Seoul, July 7,

Committee Meeting, the two sides offi- 2005)
cially established an independent
Cultural Properties Protection Subcommittee to replace the Joint Working Group on
Cultural Properties Protection, which had been operating under the Environmental
Subcommittee. The two sides also agreed to assign the new Subcommittee two initial
tasks: drawing up procedures for surveys of Korean cultural properties within USFK facilities and areas, and conducting initial surveys. Pilot surveys on Korean cultural properties
at Camp Mujeok in Pohang and Yongsan Garrison in Seoul were conducted in September and the Cultural Properties Protection Subcommittee Field Survey Procedures, establishing a framework for the efficient management of the cultural properties within USFK
installations and training areas through mutual cooperation, were finalized.
Furthermore, at the 184[th] ROK-U.S. SOFA Joint Committee Meeting, the two sides
signed the Agreed Recommendation for Yongsan Relocation Plan Engineering Memorandum of Understanding (EMOU). The EMOU prescribes the general responsibilities
and procedures for planning, programming, designing and constructing facilities required
for the relocation of USFK to Pyongtaek. The conclusion of the EMOU provided a basis
for both sides to carry out the Yongsan Relocation Plan.
Moreover, the Korean government made progress in other major SOFA issues with
its U.S. counterparts. Such issues include establishing trial joint inspections of plant and
animal products, implementing general procedures and guidelines for employment of
family members of USFK personnel, and revising Procedures Concerning USFK Participation in the ROK Employment Insurance Plan for Korean nationals employed by the
USFK. Consequently, the domestic insurance benefits have been extended to non-regular
workers and elderly workers.
As for environmental issues, Korea reflected the interests of citizens in intense consul

tations with the U.S. The two sides discussed measures to deal with the soil contamination incident outside the Kunsan Air Base in the SOFA Environmental Subcommittee and
Joint Committee: they agreed to conduct detailed joint environmental surveys to investigate the contamination incident and identify the source of contamination—the survey
was initiated on November 14. In addition, the two governments exchanged views on
remedial actions concerning contamination in facilities and areas to be returned by the
USFK. The two sides held eight formal and informal consultations, such as through the
Environmental Subcommittee and the Special Joint Committee, and a number of meetings were held among related government agencies to find solutions.
The Korean government is committed to minimizing public inconvenience through
substantive and visible improvements in the implementation of the SOFA. Future efforts
will include elevating the SOFA and improving the stationing environment for U.S.
forces. The government plans to smoothly resolve outstanding SOFA issues through
cooperative efforts with the relevant agencies.

#### Developing Future-oriented Relations with Neighboring Countries

###### 1. Korea-Japan Relations

The year 2005 marked the 60[th] anniversary of Korea’s independence from Japanese colonial rule and the 40[th] anniversary of normalization of diplomatic relations with Japan. To
commemorate, Korea and Japan designated the year 2005 as the “Year of Korea-Japan
Friendship,”[1] hoping it would serve as a
stepping stone for building futureoriented relations between the two
countries.
Despite such efforts, a series of
events including the enactment of
February 22 as “Takeshima Day”
(Takeshima being the Japanese name for
Dokdo Island) by the Shimane Prefecture Assembly, Japanese government’s

1 The year 2005 was designated as the “Year of Korea-Japan Friendship” under the theme “Together! Toward the Future, Into the World”, to celebrate
the 40[th] anniversary of the normalization of Korea-Japan relations. A variety of economic and cultural exchanges contributed to the enhancement of
mutual understanding between Koreans and Japanese.

in early April, and Prime Minister
Koizumi’s continued visits to the
Yasukuni Shrine have been negative
repercussions on the relations
between the two nations.
The government, through various
occasions such as the President’s
address during the commemoration
of the March 1 Independence Movement, the National Security Coun- Dokdo Island
cil’s statement on its Japan policy, the
President’s Special Message on Korea-Japan Relations, and numerous summits and ministerial meetings, urged its Japanese counterpart to act to history-related issues in a responsible manner. The government also highlighted the significance of Japanese politicians
acting on a basis of a correct understanding of the past history for a future-oriented relationship.
Amid tensions over the history issue, Japan’s unwillingness to cease the seabed survey
in the Korean exclusive economic zone (EEZ) in mid-April further deteriorated bilateral
relations. Although the standoff was defused by the Korean government’s firm response
and the diplomatic efforts made through vice-ministerial meetings, the dispute had a
negative impact on bilateral ties.
In his Special Address on Korea-Japan relations on April 25, President Roh Moo-hyun
stressed that, in relation to
Dokdo which is Korean territory in terms of history, geography and international law,
Japanese provocation is not
merely a matter of territorial
rights over Dokdo, but an
emblematic issue of bringing
clouds to history and our sovereignty.
However, despite such diffi- President Roh Moo-hyun, the First Lady and former Japanese Prime Minister

than 700 events related to the “Year of KoreaJapan Friendship” were accomplished and
contributed to the exchanges and expansion of
cultural and economic cooperation between
the two countries.
In terms of people-to-people and economic
exchanges, the numbers increased from 4
million people and 67.8 billion dollars in 2004
to 4.1 million people and 72.4 billion dollars in
2005, respectively.
Starting from August 1, 2005, both countries agreed to increase the number of shuttle
flights between Gimpo and Haneda from 4
flights per day to 8. The two nations also “Bukgwandaecheopbi” on exhibition at the opening

ceremony of the National Museum of Korea (Seoul,

reached an agreement to permanently exempt October 28, 2005)
short-term visas as of March 1, 2006.[2] Such
efforts are expected to further strengthen bilateral relations.
There was noteworthy progress regarding some pending history-related issues; the
returning of the “Bukgwandaecheopbi”[3] taken by Japan 100 years ago, relaxing the
screening procedures that allow Korean victims of atomic bomb in the World War II to
apply for healthcare allowances, also known as the “hibakusha booklet”, and revising the
domestic law to compensate Korean leprosy patients who were forced into sanatoriums
during Japanese colonial rule.
In 2005, the government declassified documents concerning the Korea-Japan Normalization Treaty of 1965 to the public. Such an action was considered to have significantly
contributed to enhancing transparency and encouraging public access of government
documents.
Korea and Japan, sharing history and close geographical proximity, are bound to

invasion led by Hideyoshi Toyotomi (1592-1598). Japan plundered the monument during the Russo-Japanese war in 1904. The monument was
returned to South Korea on October 20, 2005 and put on exhibition at the National Museum of Korea before being handed over to North Korea on

maintain a close relationship. However, developing a future-oriented relationship may be
difficult if a gap in the understanding of history between the two countries exists. As such,
the first Korea-Japan Joint History Research, which was launched in 2002, produced more
than 55 papers covering 19 topics of the history of the bilateral relations upon its conclusion in May 2005. At present, both countries are working toward launching a second Joint
History Research project.

###### 2. Korea-China Relations

Since the establishment of diplomatic relations in
1992, Korea and China have made remarkable
progress in numerous fields including diplomacy,
security, economy and culture. In 2005, the two
nations developed a comprehensive and cooperative partnership through summits, bilateral and
multilateral meetings at the high-level.
In 2005, the Prime Minister Lee Hae-chan’s
visit to China in June and Chinese President Hu
Jintao’s visit to Korea in November enabled the
two countries to maintain closer bilateral relations. Due to growing concerns over the North
Korean nuclear crisis, the two governments have

The two nations have also been successful in
economic and trade cooperation. In particular, bilateral trade volume between Korea and
China increased 26.6% from 79.4 billion dollars in 2004 to 100.5 billion dollars in 2005.
People-to-people exchange has also been steadily increasing as the number of visitors of
both countries has reached nearly 4,250,000 people in 2005. Moreover, with Korean soap
operas gaining popularity, the “Korean Wave” phenomenon is attracting wide interest in
China while Chinese culture is receiving attention in Korea.
The two governments worked together to resolve various bilateral issues such as

###### 3. Korea-China-Japan Trilateral Cooperation

Northeast Asia is emerging as one of the world’s third largest trading areas following
North America and the EU, and effective procedures to facilitate trilateral trading relations have been set up in various fields of cooperation.
The Korea-China-Japan Summit, launched in 1999, has become an annual meeting
with holding at the sidelines of the ASEAN+3 Summit and has widened the channels of
communication to ministerial and working group levels.
However, due to the Japanese Prime Minister Koizumi’s visit to the Yasukuni Shrine,
the trilateral summit meeting was not held in 2005, serving stumbling blocks to the cooperation among three nations.
Furthermore, the trilateral cooperation operates through a number of mechanisms at
various levels such as ministerial or senior levels in the fields of diplomacy, economy and

weather forecasting, fishery resource conservation, and so on. In 2005, the three countries held ministerial level meetings in those fields.
Overcoming the history-related issue and enhancing cooperation among the three
countries remains a challenge that Northeast Asia must address to achieve future-oriented relations.

ASEAN is Korea’s fifth largest trade partner (53.5 billion dollars), the second largest
market for the construction industry (36.7 billion dollars), and the third largest destination for Korean investment (13.8 billion dollars). Moreover, ASEAN is the major security
partner that actively supports the Policy of Peace and Prosperity.
Korea began to further strengthen its relationship with ASEAN in the early 1990s by

###### Policy of Peace and Prosperity and Diplomatic Support for Inter-Korean Exchanges and Cooperation

Since its inauguration of the Participatory Government, the government has been consistent in its pursuit of the Policy of Peace and Prosperity, which aims to bring permanent
peace and co-prosperity to the Korean Peninsula. The Policy of Peace and Prosperity is
formulated on the belief that transforming the Korean Peninsula—the epicenter of
conflict and disagreement—into a hub of peace and prosperity will contribute to peace
and stability in Northeast Asia and the world.
To this end, the government has placed a high priority on the peaceful resolution of
the security issues on the Korean Peninsula, while at the same time striving to strike a
harmonious balance between advances in inter-Korean relations and the peaceful resolution of the North Korean nuclear issue. Furthermore, in the mid- to long-term, while
establishing a durable peace regime and inter-Korean economic community, the government has been making efforts to take the initiative in creating a cooperative framework
for peace and prosperity in Northeast Asia.

###### 1. Securing the Support of the International Community for the Policy of Peace and Prosperity

To realize peace and prosperity on the Korean Peninsula and in Northeast Asia through
the pursuit of the Policy of Peace and Prosperity, Korea has been concentrating its diplomatic efforts to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue and secure international support
and cooperation.
Korea has explained its position on a range of outstanding issues and strived to gain
the support from the international community on the occasion of multilateral summits
such as the 60[th] UN General Assembly on September 13-16, APEC Economic Leaders’
Meeting on November 18-19, ASEAN+3 Summit on December 12, Korea-ASEAN
Summit on December 13 and East
Asia Summit on December 14, as
well as other summit meetings
with major countries including
the United States, China, Japan
and Russia. To that end, the
government has also taken advantage of various occasions such as
the ASEM Senior Officials’ Meeting on March 11-12, 16[th] Northeast Asia Cooperation Dialogue ASEM Foreign Ministers’ Meeting (Kyoto, May 6-7, 2005)

###### 2. Fostering Favorable Environment Conducive to Inter-Korean Cooperation

1) Steady Progress in Inter-Korean Relations

Following the suspension of dialogue after July 2004, inter-Korean dialogue got back on
track in 2005 with the Inter-Korean Vice-Ministerial Meeting on May 16-19 and Special
Envoy Chung Dong-young’s meeting with North Korea’s Chairman Kim Jong-il on June
17.
Since then, the South and the North have held thirty-four rounds of regular interKorean dialogue. Exchanges of goods and people have also expanded greatly, with the
number of visitors between the two Koreas reaching 88,341 compared to 26,534 in 2004,
and trade volume totaling 1.05 billion dollars (compared to 697 million dollars in 2004).
Inter-Korean economic cooperation has proceeded smoothly in the three major economic cooperation projects.

2) International Support for Inter-Korean Economic Cooperation

Korea has exerted diplomatic efforts to
secure the international support for the
inter-Korean economic cooperation
projects including the development of the
Gaesong Industrial Complex (GIC), and to
forge international consensus on the significance and meaning of these initiatives. To
this end, it has made full use of various
opportunities—such as the Korea-ASEAN ASEAN+3 Foreign Ministers’ Meeting (Vientiane, July 27-31,

2005)

Summit, various international meetings
and bilateral Foreign Ministers’ Meetings and working-level meetings. As a result of such
efforts, at the 9[th] Korea-ASEAN Summit on December 13, Korea and ASEAN agreed in
principle to the inclusion of products from the GIC in the Korea-ASEAN FTA.
ASEAN reaffirmed its commitment to support and complement Korea’s efforts for
peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula.

3) Efforts to Resolve Regulation Issues in Gaesong Industrial Complex (GIC)

Through consultations with
the U.S., Korea came to an
early agreement on resolving
the problem of transporting
strategically sensitive materials[1] to two of the fifteen
companies operating at the
GIC which had been a pending issue. Korea also sent a
delegation to the U.S. on July
20-24 to explain the need to

equipment to the GIC for the
purpose of infrastructure expansion in the Complex. The delegation engaged in close
consultations with the U.S. and as a result, telecommunication services in the GIC were
successfully launched at the end of December. Moreover, to secure international markets
for GIC products, an agreement on granting preferential tariff treatment was reached in
the FTA negotiations including the Korea-ASEAN FTA. The government will continue
to obtain the same treatment for GIC products as South Korean products in FTA negotiations with other countries.

4) Inter-Korean Contacts in the International Arena

Korean officials have had various opportunities to meet with high-ranking North Korean
officials on the occasion of international meetings, to engage in discussions on pending
issues on the Korean Peninsula. The Prime Minister Lee Hae-chan and President Kim
Yong-nam of the Supreme People’s Assembly Presidium met on the sidelines of the AsiaAfrica Summit in Jakarta on April 22, and shared a common understanding on the need

reaffirming their efforts to strengthen
cooperation on the international stage
and resolve the North Korean nuclear issue in a peaceful manner.

###### 3. International Humanitarian Assistance and Cooperation Projects

1) Status of International Humanitarian Assistance to North Korea

The government has been exerting diplomatic efforts to actively promote international
humanitarian assistance and training projects so as to improve the humanitarian situation
in North Korea and to facilitate greater contact with the international community.
International humanitarian assistance to North Korea was initiated upon the North’s
request for emergency aid for flood disaster relief in August 1995 and the United Nations
Department of Humanitarian Affairs (UNDHA)’s call for emergency appeal for humanitarian assistance in September of the same year. A total of ten rounds of assistance under
the United Nations Consolidated Appeals Process were provided until North Korea
requested that it be suspended in 2004.
There has been an overall decrease in international humanitarian assistance to North
Korea since 2001. The U.S.’s assistance to the North through the World Food Program

(WFP) had been gradually reduced
since 2001 and the U.S. has suspended
aid because of the insufficient monitoring of food distribution in North Korea.
The EU adopted the Plan for North
Korean Aid on June 27, 2005 that aims
to provide food aid ( 3 million) and
support the health sector ( 10.72
million), and has implemented 15.70

million worth of humanitarian aid to (Seoul, December 20, 2005)
the North. At the second North KoreaJapan Summit in May 2004, Japan pledged to offer humanitarian assistance through the
WFP and UNICEF, and has provided 125 thousand metric tons of food and 7 million
dollars worth of medical supplies. However, Japan also suspended its aid after the controversy over North Korea’s return of allegedly fake remains of a Japanese abductee. China
is also known to be offering a considerable amount of aid to the North annually.
The WFP has contributed 4 million metric tons of food aid since 1995, and provided
280,000 metric tons of food in 2005 alone. The World Health Organization (WHO)’s
initiatives have mainly consisted of providing medical facilities and supplies, improving
medical training, epidemic control, and the eradication of tuberculosis and malaria. The
WHO contributed 2.18 million dollars worth of aid in 2005. The United Nations Development Program (UNDP) is pursuing cooperative projects with the North of a value of
22.22 million dollars for 2005-2006, and UNICEF has carried out programs of a value of
10.30 million dollars that focus on child health, nutrition and education.

2) Assistance to North Korea through International Channels

Korea has actively engaged in a wide range of international aid projects to North Korea
since 1995. In 2005, it provided 1 million dollars for UNICEF’s projects directed at
improving child nutrition and 98,000 dollars for the WHO’s malaria prevention and
control program.
The government has also contributed to the United Nations Economic and Social
Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP)’s programs for training and educating
North Korean workers and experts. During the first half of 2005, UNESCAP’s first training programs in various fields—energy, environment, and transportation—provided
North Korean workers with an opportunity to broaden their understanding of the
outside world and to participate in the international community.
In August, the North, saying that as the food situation there had improved they no
longer needed food aid, requested that international organizations and NGOs wind up
emergency food aid projects by the end of 2005, calling for development assistance
instead.
However, the Korean government, considering that the North continues to face food
shortages and that international organizations would be unable to respond to emergency
situations in a timely and effective manner once they withdrew from the region, has
engaged in close consultations with international organizations such as the WFP and
major donor countries, actively endeavoring to ensure their continued humanitarian
assistance to North Korea. Furthermore, through inter-Korean dialogue channels, including the Inter-Korean Ministerial Talks, Korea has urged the North to continue to accept
international humanitarian assistance.

###### 4. North Korean Asylum Seekers

Korea, on humanitarian grounds, has been accepting North Korean asylum seekers who
wish to settle in Korea on their own free will, and also providing assistance to those wishing to settle in their current place of residence.
In dealing with the issues, a priority has been placed on ensuring the safety of individ

uals. The diplomatic cooperation and understanding of the host government is essential
for the transfer of refugees to Korea, and the Korean government has been taking a
rather ‘quiet’ approach to avoid unnecessary publicity. However, it has been requesting
host countries to help prevent any forced deportation to North Korea. It has also been
closely cooperating with host governments and international organizations, including the
UNHCR, for the prompt and safe transfer of individuals fleeing from the North and wishing to reside in Korea. From a long-term perspective, it has continued to make efforts,
through the pursuit of the Policy of Peace and Prosperity, to achieve improvements in
the humanitarian situation, including food shortages, in the North, thereby addressing
fundamental causes of North Korean asylum seekers.
The number of North Korean asylum seekers rose drastically every year up until 2002,
and has been gradually rising since 2003. 1,387 North Korean asylum seekers settled in
Korea in accordance with their own wishes in 2005.

##### Promoting National Interest through Multi-dimensional Summit Diplomacy

Korea has undertaken a more vigorous role, commensurate to its national status based
on matured development within the international community.
The scope of summit diplomacy has been extended beyond the Northeast Asia, where
its neighboring countries have been maintaining friendly and cooperative relations with
Korea, to areas including Europe, Central Asia and Latin America in 2005. Summit diplomacy has indeed provided Korea with ample opportunities in negotiating issues directly
related to national interests, such as resources, energy, developing and maintaining
foreign markets and establishing a fair and just international economic order.
Furthermore, by participating in multilateral summit meetings such as the ASEAN+3
and the EAS, Korea’s diplomatic competency has been revived. The successful hosting of
the 13[th] APEC Economic Leaders’ Meeting, in particular, vividly demonstrated the capability of summit diplomacy to the rest of the world.

###### 3. High-Level Diplomacy Complementing Summit Diplomacy

Summit diplomacy is undoubtedly of great importance. Yet, given the balance between
conducting state affairs and foreign policy, as well as the time and geographical limits, it is
impossible to cover all international affairs and regions by summit diplomacy alone.
Diplomacy conducted at a high-level complements summit diplomacy in this regard.
Diversification and implementation of high-level diplomacy on a regular basis increases
mutual understanding and policy coordination with other countries. Moreover, it is a
useful tool for closer coordination between the working level officials in the fields of

economic and trade cooperation as well as in
political affairs. In this respect, high-level
diplomacy is as important as summit diplomacy.

Assembly, Prime Minister, and Minister of

diplomacy to a great extent.

**“Meeting the World Leaders”**
An Essay by a Volunteer at the Busan APEC Summit

By Hur Nany (Junior, Division of Int. Studies, Korea University)

It was with some unease that I met my professors in early November. I had been selected to take part as

a volunteer in the Busan APEC Summit from November 8 to 20. Yet, it meant that I would have to miss

some of my classes. As a student of International Relations, this was, in fact, a good opportunity to gain

real experience in the diplomatic field. Fortunately, my professors understood my absence and even gave

me some encouragement.

I arrived in Busan on November 8. The APEC Summit was held in the main conference hall of BEXCO

located near Haeundae Beach Busan city. We had a good view of the Nurimaru APEC House, the

conference hall of APEC, from our accommodation building. I was so thrilled to be part of the summit and

could feel the fresh sea breeze as I headed for the hotel.

I worked as a Temporary Protocol Officer until November 16. The Temporary Protocol Officers were in

charge of communicating with the 21 APEC Member States, and the APEC Secretariat and its other

agencies. We were also responsible for attending to the Senior Officials of the APEC member countries,

ranging from managing their transportation schedules to arranging bilateral meetings.

I was tasked with attending to the schedules for the Executive Director of the APEC Secretariat,

Ambassador of the host country the ROK, the Deputy Executive Director, and the Ambassador of Vietnam,

the host of next year’s summit.

The Secretariat staff were from very different cultural backgrounds but what they had in common was

warmth and kindness.

The most unforgettable moment during the summit was the huge fireworks displayed over the

Gwangan Grand Bridge in Busan. When I took the Deputy Executive Director to the ceremony, we found

ourselves amongst a crowd of thousands of people. With some difficulty, I managed to lead him to his

designated seat. Even now, when I think of that day, I clearly remember feeling so tense that I could cry.

The Deputy Executive Director invited me for dinner with other Vietnamese participants, and gave me a

present of traditional Vietnamese crafts.

After successfully fulfilling my role as a Temporary Protocol Officer, I left the APEC Secretariat to carry

out another task of assisting the summit leaders. The responsibilities of this time were to assist summit

leaders at dinner parties and assist them in wearing the Durumagi (Korean traditional coat) at the second

session of the Summit meeting which was held at the Nurimaru APEC House. The twenty-four support

staff practiced many times wearing the Hanbok (traditional Korean clothing) which was designed by Lee

Young-hee and we were also taught proper etiquette.

At the dinner party on November 18, I

was worried that I would make mistakes

wearing the Hanbok and Kokshin

(traditional shoes for women) as I was not

I was assigned to assist the President

of Vietnam. Finally, the summit leaders

from each economy gathered,

accompanied by their own staff

members, and headed to the dinner party. Meeting with Busan APEC volunteers (Seoul, July 7, 2005)

I was very excited to see the summit

leaders from so close, when otherwise I would only be able to watch them on TV.

The President of Vietnam welcomed me with a big smile, followed by a handshake. After showing him

to his seat, I left the banquet with a feeling of great satisfaction.

On the last day of the summit, we got dressed up and headed for the Nurimaru APEC House. We

waited for the Leaders, each of us holding the Durumagi (Korean traditional coat) in our hands. The APEC

Leaders who had finished their luncheon warmly welcomed us. Seeing them so close, I felt that these

leaders were just as humble and warm-hearted as the rest of us. After the summit meeting, I left the

Nurimaru feeling grateful for this memorable experience.

It took me a while to adjust back to my normal routine. I felt as if I was having after-effects of the

APEC Summit and my coworkers seemed to feel the same way. We knew exactly what these after-effects

were. It felt like looking at the endless horizon from the top of a mountain.

Du Fu, a Chinese poet, once recited a piece of verse saying, “I will climb the great mountain and see

how small the other mountains are.” He was only twenty at that time.

I feel proud to say that the APEC Summit provided me with memories to cherish as well as inspiring in

me the motivation to have a goal to pursue in my life.

Board of Governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in 2005. This has
laid a firmer basis for Korea to further reflect its national interests in the said international
organizations.
For the first time since its admission to the UN, Korea was appointed as the Chair of
the First Committee of the 60[th] Session of the UN General Assembly in 2005. Moreover,
Korea has assumed the chairmanship and presidency of major international organizations, such as the Chair of the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR). The government will also continue its diplomatic efforts to serve as a member of Executive Committees and to assume the presidency and chairmanship of major international organizations.

2) Recruitments of Koreans in International Organizations

With the aim of elevating the national status and increasing its influence in the international arena, the government has been encouraging Korean nationals to assume highprofile positions on Executive Committees and senior positions in major international
organizations.
The International Organizations Human Resources Center of Korea, since its establishment in 1996, has been actively undertaking activities to promote the recruitment of

employment opportunities in international organizations.
Building upon the existing infrastructure and the progress made, MOFAT will continue to encourage competent Korean nationals to apply for international organizations.

3) Hosting International Organizations

Following a resolution adopted by the UN
Economic and Social Commission for Asia
and the Pacific (ESCAP) in November 2005
on the launch of the Asian and Pacific Training Center for Information and Communication Technology for Development (APCICT), the center was opened in Incheon on
June 16, 2006 as the first subsidiary organ of
the UN in Korea.
It is envisaged that through the Center,
Korea will play a leading role in the training
of human resources in information and
communication technology in the AsiaPacific region. Through sharing Korea’s
information technology, Korea will APCICT Inaugural Ceremony (Incheon, June 16, 2006)
contribute to bridging the digital divide in
developing countries and in turn enhance its national status.
Moreover, the funding is in place for the International Vaccine Institute (IVI), also
located in Korea, and is now preparing to fully embark on its activities. The IVI will give
rise to greater opportunities for Korea to make a valuable contribution in the field of
health and welfare on the international level.

###### 3. Other Activities in International Organizations

1) Expansion of UN Peacekeeping Operations (PKO)[2]

As the 10[th] largest contributor to the UN PKO budget, Korea has been gradually expanding its PKO related activities, increasing its financial contributions to PKO and sending
eight military observers to the UN Mission in Sudan (UNMIS). In addition, once the
discussions on introducing the procedures for rapid dispatch[3] is concluded at the National
Assembly, more active participation is expected.
Korea ranks 67[th] in terms of the number of PKO troops dispatched as of May 2006.

2 “Peacekeeping Operations (PKO)” refers to activities whereby, with the approval of the concerned parties, the UN dispatches peacekeeping troops or
observer missions to the conflict zone to engage in monitoring ceasefires and armistices and maintaining public order.

3 The relatively low participation by Korea in PKO activities has been attributed not only to the fact that it takes from 6 to 12 months to dispatch troops
but also that it is difficult to obtain approval by the National Assembly during the recess.

After a series of efforts by the government to resolve the issue, the National
Assembly agreed to dissolve Korea’s
overdues by 2008. Korea’s overdue UN
bills have been accumulating since 2001
after the decision at the UN General
Assembly to increase Korea’s contribution to the UN regular budget was made
in 2001.

Korea has participated in the UN Commission on Human Rights, stating its position on
human rights issues and presenting the government’s policies on the protection and
enhancement of human rights.
At the 61[st] Session of the Commission on Human Rights in 2005, the Resolution on
the Situation of Human Rights in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK),
which has been passed in three consecutive years since the 59[th] UN Commission on
Human Rights in 2003, was adopted. Given the special nature of inter-Korean relations,
Korea abstained from voting. However, it expressed its deep concern over human rights
violations in North Korea by delivering an Explanation of Vote (EOV). Moreover, in
order to foster an environment conducive to North Korea’s voluntary participation in the
international community and to enhance its human rights situation, the government
made clear that it intended to support the opening up and reform of North Korea and

offer humanitarian assistance as well as pursue
economic cooperation projects. Korea also
urged the North to improve the human rights
of its people through international dialogue
and cooperation.
In addition, the government actively
participated in discussions on protecting and
enhancing human rights by co-sponsoring
twenty-one resolutions, including the resolution on the human rights situation in Myanmar.

3) Women’s and Children’s Rights

The Korean delegation, headed by Jang Ha-jin, Minister of Gender Equality and Family,
attended the meeting to commemorate the 10[th] anniversary of the fourth UN World
Conference on Women held in Beijing on August 29-September 1, 2005. Minister Jang
presented the efforts and accomplishments by the Participatory Government in implementing the Beijing Platform for Action adopted in 1995, including the establishment of
the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family, and pledged to participate in the efforts by
the international community to enhance the status of women.
Moreover, Shin Hei-soo, the Chairperson of the Korean Council for the Women
Drafted for Military Sexual Slavery by Japan, was reelected as a member of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) for the term 20052008. She has been actively involved in the Committee since 2001.
The second bilateral meeting between Korea and the United Nations Children’s Fund
(UNICEF) was held in New York in January 2005. Korea, as one of the few countries to
have developed from a beneficiary into a donor country at UNICEF, will strengthen its
cooperation on protecting children through bilateral consultations with the organization.
In addition, in 2005, Professor Lee Yang-hee was reelected as a member of the
Committee on the Rights of the Child, the body that monitors the implementation of the
Convention on the Rights of the Child. Initially

Meeting on Avian Influenza at the WHO (Geneva, November 7, 2005)

Geun-tae, the Minister of
Health and Welfare,
attended the 58[th] World Health Assembly of the WHO in Geneva, Switzerland from May
15-20, 2005. He set forth Korea’s views on current health matters such as the international response to malaria, polio, tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, avian influenza (AI) and the
amendment of health regulations.
Moreover, on May 16, the government met with its North Korean counterpart and
proposed an inter-Korean cooperation on various health issues, such as AI, tuberculosis,
malaria and oriental medicine.
The AI, which has been recurring intermittently in East Asia since 1997, had spread
around the world in August 2005, reaching Turkey and Romania. In the midst of growing
concerns over its spread through humans, the government has actively participated in
regional and international discussions on measures to combat AI.

###### 5. Participation in Disarmament and Non-Proliferation Activities

1) International Trends

Since the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD)

118 | 2006 Diplomatic White Paper


-----

and their delivery means has emerged as the greatest threat to international peace and
security. Recently, there have been growing concerns that loopholes in international nonproliferation arrangements might be exploited, for example by developing nuclear
weapons under the guise of peaceful uses of nuclear energy. Moreover, there is an
increasing risk of terrorist groups acquiring WMD and their delivery means. In particular,
the black market network, led by Pakistani Dr. Khan, has only too clearly highlighted the
shortcomings in the current non-proliferation regimes.
In an effort to deal with the proliferation of WMD, the international community has
been strengthening and restructuring international non-proliferation arrangements.
Those efforts may be grouped into the following three broad categories.
First, multilateral controls have been tightened. The International Atomic Energy
Agency (IAEA) has adopted Additional Protocols[5] to prevent the illegal use of nuclear
materials. Furthermore, in an effort to deal with new threats, the multilateral export
control regime[6] also strengthened its mechanisms to control the transfer of strategic
materials.[7]

Second, policy coordination among countries sharing similar policy frameworks has
been strengthened. For example, leaders at the G8 Summit in June 2002 launched the
Global Partnership[8] to contain the proliferation of WMD and related materials and,
launched the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI)[9] in the 2003.

5 An Additional Safeguards Protocol to the comprehensive safeguards agreements (CSAs) with the IAEA was adopted by the IAEA’s Board of Governors
in 1997, under which the IAEA is granted additional authority to conduct inspections. Under the CSA, all non-nuclear weapon states are obliged to
declare all their nuclear facilities and materials, and the IAEA uses the declaration as a kind of nuclear inventory checklist for that country. However,
due to concerns over Iraq and North Korea, and recent discoveries of undeclared nuclear activities by Iran, the IAEA has sought to complement and
strengthen its verification system through the Additional Protocol.

6 Strategic goods refers to items for military use that can be employed for the development, production and use of WMD and conventional weapons,
including dual-use goods and technologies and deadly weapons.

7 The multilateral export control regime is a voluntary system for consultations among countries to prevent the illegal export and diversion of strategic
goods, illegal export of conventional weapons and consequent destabilization of regional security. Nuclear materials are controlled by the Nuclear
Suppliers Group (NSG) and Zangger Committee (ZC), biological and chemical materials by the Australia Group (AG), missile related goods by the
Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR), and dual-use goods and conventional weapons by the Wassenaar Arrangement (WA).

8 The Global Partnership was formed to expand the Cooperative Threat Reduction initiatives through the participation by a great number of countries
with the G-8 at its core. The Cooperative Threat Reduction was pursued by the U.S. in an effort to ensure the security of Soviet nuclear facilities and
nuclear material after the end of the Cold War. Twenty-four countries, including the EU, currently participate in the G8 GP under the “Ten Plus over
Ten” plan whereby the U.S. pledges and other countries each pledge 10 billion dollars over the next 10 years from 2002.

9 The Proliferation Security Initiative is a voluntary system for policy coordination among countries to stop the shipment of WMD, their delivery means,
related equipment and materials to countries and groups of proliferation concern. 80 countries currently officially participate in the PSI as of October
2006.

Chapter 3. Strengthening Cooperation in the International Arena | 119


-----

Third, non-proliferation norms have emerged and been spreading. In April 2004, the
UN Security Council adopted Resolution 1540 prohibiting its members from supporting
non-state actors’ development, acquisition and transfer of WMD and their delivery
means. In order to sever connections between terrorism and WMD, it mandated effective export controls by all UN member states. Accordingly, the International Maritime
Organization (IMO) adopted a Protocol revising the Convention for the Suppression of
Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Maritime Navigation (SUA) in October 2005, thereby
reinforcing international laws applicable to the control of illegal exports of WMD and
related materials.

2) Activities of Korea

The Korean government, as a member of major agreements on disarmament and nonproliferation as well as multilateral export control arrangements, recognizes WMD proliferation as a threat to international and national security, and actively participates in the
international efforts for non-proliferation of WMD. Its major activities during 2005 in the
frameworks for multilateral cooperation are as follows.

120 | 2006 Diplomatic White Paper


-----

First, the government took part
in the UN’s multilateral disarmament and non-proliferation activities. In September 2005, it assumed
the chairmanship of the First
Committee on Disarmament and
International Security of the 60[th]

Session of the UN General Assembly. Korea has contributed to the
greater participation of international
civic society such as NGOs and to The Fourth Joint Conference on Disarmament and Non-Proliferation
the more efficient operation of the (Busan, December 1, 2005)
committee. Moreover, from February to March 2006, it chaired the Geneva Conference on Disarmament (CD), the only
multilateral organization for disarmament negotiations in the world.
Second, the government actively contributed to international counter-proliferation
efforts by holding the chairmanship of multilateral export control regimes. It chaired the
Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR)[10] for a year from September 2004. In October 2004, it hosted the Plenary Meeting of the MTCR in Seoul, thereby raising awareness
of missile proliferation in Northeast Asia. As the Chair of the MTCR for the following
year, Korea made efforts for international missile non-proliferation, actively conducting
outreach to the Asian and Middle East regions.
Furthermore, in 2005, it held the chairmanship of the Wassenaar Arrangement (WA)
General Working Group, which controls the transfers of conventional arms, dual-use
goods and technologies.
Fourth, the government commenced its official financial contributions to the G8
Global Partnership, in which it has participated since the 2004 G8 summit at Sea Island in
the U.S. in June 2004. In 2005, the government provided $250,000 for each of the two
joint projects, one of which aims to dismantle decommissioned Russian nuclear
submarines with Norway, and the other to provide alternative energy following the
dismantlement of Russia’s outdated nuclear reactors in Zheleznogorsk with the U.S. and

10 The Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) was established in 1987 in order to prevent the proliferation of missiles, unmanned air vehicles and
related technology as well as to control the export of devices capable of delivering weapons of mass destruction (WMD). Korea joined in 2001 and
has actively participated in controlling the export of related equipment and technology, and in the exchange of information on missile related trends.

others. Furthermore, Korea actively participated in nuclear non-proliferation efforts at
the international level, for example, by providing $710,000 for a project to support the
International Science and Technology Center (ISTC) in Moscow.
Fifth, the government and the UN Regional Center for Peace and Disarmament in
Asia and the Pacific jointly hosted the fourth Joint Conference on Disarmament and NonProliferation in Busan in December 2005. Participants discussed major issues such as the
non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and WMD, the implementation of the UN Security
Council Resolution 1540, as well as the North Korean and Iranian nuclear issues in the
field of disarmament and non-proliferation. During the conference, Korea facilitated
active dialogue among countries within the region, including the U.S., Japan, China and
Russia, thereby enhancing its status in the field.

###### 6. Strengthening Multilateral Security Cooperation

1) International Cooperation against Terrorism

**(1) International Trends**

The 9/11 terrorist attack brought into sharp focus the serious threat that terrorism poses
to international peace and security, and indeed human civilization itself. In 2005, there
were 1,877 terrorist attacks around the world, representing a 50% increase over 2004.
Large-scale terrorist attacks occurred all around the globe in 2005, including the
terrorist bombings in London in July, Bali in October and Amman in November. Particularly, terrorist attacks in Iraq, which indiscriminately targeted diplomats, Iraqi security
forces, government officials and civilians alarmed the world.
It is believed that the majority of the acts of terror were committed by forces with
links to Al-Qaeda. The Al-Qaeda network, the main perpetrator of the 9/11 attacks, has
been significantly weakened through international efforts. However, its remaining forces
are still exercising influence, calling for a jihad through the media and the internet. Scattered forces connected with Al-Qaeda such as Al-Zarqawi and Jemaah Islamiah, are also

122 | 2006 Diplomatic White Paper


-----

instigating terrorist attacks. In addition, the London bombings in July 2005, which were
perpetrated by indigenous radicalized British nationals, shocked the international
community.
In 2005, given the possibility that Korea could become a victim of such terrorist
threats due to its deployment of troops to Iraq and the hosting of the APEC Economic
Leaders’ Meeting in Busan, the government exerted every possible effort to ensure security. As a result, although six Korean nationals were injured in the Bali Bombings in October, there were no other serious cases of damage as a result of terrorism and the APEC
Economic Leaders’ Meeting was held in safety.

**(2) Strengthening the Domestic System for Countermeasures**

The government amended its “National
Anti-Terror Action Directive” (Presidential Decree No. 47) in March 2005 and
established a governmental system
against terrorism by launching the
Counter-Terrorism Council presided by
the Prime Minister, and the Standing
Committee for Counter-Terrorism
presided by the Director of the National Briefing of Crisis Management Manual for disaster management

(Seoul, November 29, 2005)

Intelligence Service. The CounterTerrorism Working Group Meeting attended by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and
Trade, National Intelligence Service, and National Police Agency, is being held on a regular basis to ensure a rapid and effective response to terror-related problems. Furthermore,
MOFAT created the International Counter-Terrorism Cooperation Division.
Moreover, the government created the National Crisis Management Manual comprising
eight categories including the overseas, maritime, aviation, radioactive, and biochemical
fields, to enable a systematic and comprehensive response in the event of a whole range
of terrorist attacks and threats.
In particular, the _Crisis Management Manual indicates that the Government Joint_
Response Team, composed of concerned government authorities—such as MOFAT, the
Ministry of Defense, and the National Police Agency—will be promptly dispatched to the
scene in case of a major terrorist attack.

**(3) Korea's International Counter-Terrorism Cooperation**

International cooperation is essential
in safeguarding the world from terrorist threats and attacks. In this regard,
the government actively participates
in internationally concerted efforts
through the UN, the ARF, APEC and
ASEM for the prevention of and
response to terrorism. It has also
strived to strengthen bilateral cooperation with countries such as Russia,

The Signing of the Korea-ASEAN Joint Declaration to combat

China, Spain and Southeast Asian international terrorism (Vientiane, July 27, 2005)
nations.
The UN, the main platform for international cooperation against terrorism, adopted a
number of Security Council resolutions including 1373[11], 1540[12], and 1566[13] and urges
member states to take comprehensive measures against terrorism.
The Korean government submitted four reports regarding the implementations to the
UN Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) and actively carried out the relevant
measures. The nation is party to twelve anti-terrorism conventions and protocols[14] and
signed the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism,[15]

11 Resolution 1373 urges each nation to take actions against terrorism in areas such as suppressing the funding of terrorism and border controls. The
CTC was established for the implementation of the resolution.

12 Resolution 1540 urges each nation to take steps to prevent terrorists from having access to WMD.

13 Resolution 1566 defines Al-Qaeda, the Taliban and related organizations as terrorist organizations and imposes sanctions on them.

In 2005, as the host country of the APEC Economic Leaders’ Meeting, Korea hosted
the third APEC Secure Trade in the APEC Region Conference (STAR III) in Incheon on
February 25-26, to explore measures for cooperation in the areas of maritime and aviation security. Furthermore, at the first ASEM Cyber Security Workshop in Seoul on June
23-24, the government suggested counter measures against cyber-terrorism, drawing
upon its leading information technology.
In addition, Foreign Minister Ban Ki-moon attended the ASEAN+3 Foreign Ministers’
Meeting on July 27, to reinforce cooperation against terrorism with the Southeast Asian
countries and signed the Korea-ASEAN Joint Declaration for Cooperation to combat
international terrorism.

2) Multilateral Security Cooperation

**(1) ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF)[16]**


Korea has actively participated in
the ARF process at various levels,
including the annual Ministerial
Meetings, since its launch in 1994.
At the 12[th] ARF Ministerial
Meeting held in Vientiane, Laos on
July 29, 2005, the twenty-five
participating countries, including
the two Koreas, discussed ways to
respond to newly emerging security threats such as terrorism and
transnational crime, as well as the
future direction of the ARF. During


12[th] ARF Foreign Ministers’ Meeting (Vientiane, July 29, 2005)


16 The ASEAN Regional Forum, established in 1994, draws together 26 countries which have a bearing on the security of the Asia-Pacific region. It
comprises the 10 ASEAN member states and dialogue partners such as Australia, Canada, China, EU, Japan, Russia and the U.S. Annually, the ARF
holds two ARF Intersessional Support Group (ISG) Meetings on Confidence Building Measures (CBM) and Preventive Diplomacy (PD) and the ARF
Senior Officials’ Meeting (SOM) at official level to discuss important security issues of the region.

the meeting, the participants agreed that the ARF is currently in the process of moving
toward preventive diplomacy from the confidence-building stage, and welcomed the
Korean government’s proposal to host the inaugural meeting of the ARF Experts and
Eminent Persons (EEPs).
In the meeting, Foreign Minister Ban Ki-moon explained the status of the North Korean nuclear issue, as well as current developments in the Six-Party Talks and inter-Korean
relations. He also participated in the discussions on global security issues such as terrorism and the situation in Iraq. Furthermore, Foreign Minister Ban met with his North
Korean counterpart, Paek Nam-sun, and exchanged views on inter-Korean relations and
joint efforts to achieve advances in the Six-Party Talks process, as well as in inter-Korean
cooperation in the international arena. The results were released in a Joint Press Statement at the conclusion of the meeting.

**(2) Cooperation with International Security Organizations**

**• North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)**
Since the end of Cold War, NATO, with the
enlargement of its membership, has taken on additional responsibilities including peace-keeping and
peace-supporting operations in order to confront
proactively the new security challenges of the 21[st]

century, such as those posed by international
terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction (WMD). NATO, thus, has been
expanding its role both in terms of geographical
scope and functions.
Foreign Minister Ban, on the invitation of the
NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, Foreign Minister Ban attending the North Atlantic
became the first Korean high-level official to make Council of NATO (Brussels, December 2, 2005)
an official visit to the NATO headquarters in Brussels. He attended the North Atlantic Council (NAC), NATO’s highest decision-making
body, on December 2, 2005 and delivered a speech to the Ambassadors of the twenty-six
NATO member states on the North Korean nuclear issue, inter-Korean relations, the
Northeast Asian security situation and the future development of the Korea-NATO coop

eration. Minister Ban’s visit to NATO was only the second official visit by a Foreign
Minister of a non-NATO country without any partnership relations with NATO, following that by Australia.
The visit served as an opportunity to convey Korea’s perspectives and positions on the
North Korean nuclear issue and Northeast Asian security situation to NATO member
states and paved the way for security cooperation at the international level beyond the
Asia-Pacific region.

**• The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)**
Foreign Minister Ban attended the 13[th] Session of the Ministerial Council of the Organization for Security and Cooperation (OSCE) in Slovenia on December 5-6, 2005, with the
aim of stepping up cooperation with the organization. The members of the OSCE
comprise all European countries, the United States, Russia and Canada.
Foreign Minister Ban delivered a speech in the Plenary Session of the Ministerial
Council on the current situation on the Korean Peninsula and in Northeast Asia. While
explaining the various initiatives taken to draw upon the experience of the OSCE in
Northeast Asia, he emphasized the need to bolster an overall cooperation between Korea
and the OSCE.
To that end, following upon the first Korea-OSCE Conference in 2001, the government hosted the Korea-OSCE Conference in Seoul under the title of “New Security
Threats and New Security
Paradigm” on April 25-26,
2005. During the conference,
more than 120 delegates from
the OSCE member states and
the ARF held in-depth discussions on the new security
threats of the 21[st] century as
well as ways to respond to
these threats and the possibilities for applying the OSCE
security cooperation model to Foreign Minister Ban attending the Ministerial Council of the Organization for

**(3) Multilateral Security Dialogue at the Non-Governmental Level**

**• Northeast Asia Cooperation Dialogue (NEACD)[17]**

The Korean government, seeking to secure permanent peace and security in Northeast
Asia through the promotion of mutual understanding and confidence-building in the
region, has emphasized the need to create a regional multilateral security cooperation
mechanism and encouraged the U.S., China, Japan and Russia to join in its efforts. Also,
apart from such governmental efforts, multilateral security dialogue at the non-governmental level has also been under way.
The 16[th] NEACD was held in Seoul in April 2005, providing a venue for meaningful
discussions on regional security issues,
including the Six-Party Talks, the North
Korean nuclear issue and issues of history. North Korea, which had participated
in the NEACD since 2002, did not attend
the 16[th] meeting. At the 17[th] NEACD
meeting held in Tokyo in April 2006, all
the parties to the Six-Party Talks participated for in-depth discussions on major
security issues in the region. 16[th] NEACD (Seoul, April 12, 2005)

**• Council for Security Cooperation in the Asia-Pacific (CSCAP)**
The CSCAP is a non-governmental security cooperation forum in which twenty-one
countries from the Asia-Pacific region participate in discussions on regional security
issues. Each CSCAP member country has its own national CSCAP Committee. The
CSCAP has established six Study Groups which carry out in-depth research on various
topics—future prospects for a multilateral security framework in Northeast Asia,
maritime security cooperation and counter-proliferation of WMD—putting forward suitable measures for the advancement of dialogue at the government level. In particular,
CSCAP is the only non-governmental security cooperation forum in which North Korea
participates as a full member.

17 The Northeast Asia Cooperation Dialogue (NEACD) was founded by the IGCC in 1993 as an informal track-two dialogue exploring the potential for
cooperation on security issues among China, Japan, Russia, the two Koreas and the U.S. The annual meetings are held to discuss on the issues
such as confidence building in Northeast Asia.

The Korean government held the CSCAP Study Group meeting on Multilateral Security Cooperation in Seoul in November 2005, inviting distinguished scholars from CSCAP
member countries. In August, Korea also held a seminar under the theme of “New
Approaches to Northeast Asian Security Cooperation” in association with the CSCAP
Korea, inviting members of the diplomatic corps in Seoul to attend.

**• Jeju Peace Forum**
The Korean government has been holding the
biennial Jeju Peace Forum since 2001 to
commemorate the historic Inter-Korean
Summit of June 15, 2000, and to provide a
valuable opportunity to enhance regional
cooperation and confidence-building in Northeast Asia.
The third Jeju Peace Forum was held on
Jeju Island on June 9-11, 2005, under the theme
“Building a Northeast Asian Community:
Towards Peace and Prosperity,” with more
than one hundred distinguished scholars, businessmen, and government officials attending. Prime Minister Lee Hae-chan delivering his keynote

speech of the third Jeju Peace Forum (Jeju, June 10,

Participants included Prime Minister Lee 2005)

Tomiichi Murayama, and former Chinese Vice Premier Qian Qichen. They recognized
the need for confidence-building and peaceful resolution of the North Korean nuclear
issue in order to overcome the vestiges of the Cold War in Northeast Asia.
At the close of the forum, the “Jeju Declaration on Building a Northeast Asian
Community” was adopted, urging countries concerned to take prompt action for the
realization of a Northeast Asian community.
This was the first international forum held in Jeju since its designation as the “Island of
World Peace” in 2005. The forum has contributed to the promotion of dialogue among
the countries in Northeast Asia as well as enhancing international recognition of the
Island.

###### Contribution to the International Community through Development Cooperation

 1. Korea’s Current ODA

1) The ODA[1] in 2005

Korea’s Official Development Assistance (ODA) in 2005 amounted to 743.64 million
dollars, which was a 75.7% increase from 423.32 million dollars in 2004. More specifically,
the bilateral assistance amounted to 456.49 million dollars and multilateral assistance
through international organizations summed up to 287.15 million dollars.
Although its scale of ODA has been steadily increasing, the total amount of Korea’s
ODA in absolute terms and the ratio of aid grants still remain low.
As a reference, compared to the developed donor countries such as OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC)[2] members, the size of Korea’s ODA marked the 18[th]

1 Official Development Assistance (ODA) refers to the grant and concessional loans provided by a government agency to the developing countries to
assist their economic and social development, and is also called Development Cooperation or International Cooperation.

2 Development Assistance Committee (DAC) is a committee under the OECD in which the development assistance providing states discuss
development assistance policy adjustment and methods to increase efficiency of the assistance.

largest and further lower in terms of the GNI ratio. In addition, it could be noted that
Korea’s share of grants in bilateral ODA stays in the range of less than 70 percent; to the
contrary, the DAC members are providing almost 99 percent of their bilateral assistance
as grant.

2) The ODA of Developed Countries

The total amount of assistance provided by the OECD DAC member states to developing countries mounted to 106.5 billion dollars in 2005. Their ODA to GNI ratio in average was 0.33%, which is 0.07% higher than that of 2004.
The U.S. provided the largest assistance in absolute value, which was 27.4 billion
dollars, and was followed by other nations such as Japan ($13.1 billion), Great Britain
($10.7 billion), France ($10.0 billion), and Germany ($9.9 billion). After the 9/11, the U.S.
has steadily increased the amount of ODA and maintained the highest amount of assistance in the world since 2001. Japan’s ODA had been decreasing since 2001, however it
increased by 47% in 2005 compared to that of the previous year.
Among the developed donor countries, only five countries met the UN’s recommended rate of 0.7% in terms of ODA to GNI ratio; the countries include Norway (0.93%),
Sweden (0.92%), Luxembourg (0.87%), the Netherlands (0.82%), and Denmark (0.81%).

###### 2. Major Outcomes of the ODA

1) Scaling Up of the ODA and Improvement of the Assistance System

Advancing to one of the 10[th] largest economies in the world, Korea is expected to
increase its ODA to the developing countries in proportion to its increased economic
power. To that end, Korea has made efforts to increase its ODA.

**ODA/GNI Ratio of the OECD Countries**


_Source: OECD, International Development Statistics Online DB, 2005 (est.)_

First of all, a mid-term national ODA budget plan for 2005-2009 was adopted with the
incremental financial allocations of the ODA up to 0.1% of GNI. The government has
approved a national plan for the improvement of the ODA that was confirmed at the
Cabinet Ministers’ Meeting on November 15, 2005.
Looking back on the 20 years of Korea’s ODA, the government attaches a great significance not only to reach a consensual understanding on the need to increase the ODA but
also to establish a comprehensive national ODA plan aimed at streamlining its assistance
system, which covers concessional loans and grants as well. In this line, the government
designated the Prime Minister as the chairman for the International Development Cooperation Committee (IDCC). The government also plans to hold an IDCC meeting on a

countries are providing over 90% of their assistance as grants, Korea also faces the need
to increase its assistance as grants.

2) Assistance for Iraq Reconstruction

The government has promised to provide 260 million dollars of grant aid for the period
of 2003-2007 for the reconstruction of Iraq. Following the commitment, Korea provided
60 million dollars between 2003 and 2004, and another 60 million dollars in 2005 as grant.
The assistance to Iraq is subject to the Iraqi central government and the local government
of Arbil, where Korea’s Zaytun unit is deployed. The objective of the grant is to improve
Iraq’s administrative ability, social infrastructure and human resource development.
In 2005, the government invited 488 Iraqi government officials from the central
government and Arbil local government to Korea for training and has supported four
projects such as building school in Arbil. It also provided equipments and vaccines for the
Avian Influenza to Arbil, which was affected by the epidemic.
Apart from the bilateral assistance to Iraq, Korea provided a total amount of 15
million dollars to the International Reconstruction Fund Facility for Iraq through the UN
and the World Bank between 2004 and 2005.
Its decision to assist Iraq with 260 million dollars is the largest amount of Korean ODA
provided to a single country. This commitment enabled Korea to participate as a

member state of the Iraq Core Group and Donor Committee for Reconstruction of Iraq,
which is the body that determines the basic direction for the reconstruction project in
Iraq.
Through the active participation in major organizations for the Iraq reconstruction,
Korea expanded its contribution to the reconstruction of Iraq.

3) Assistance for Afghanistan Reconstruction

In the Donor’s Ministerial Meeting to
assist Afghanistan held in Tokyo (January 2002), the government announced
its plan to provide a total amount 45
million dollars of grant between 2002
and 2004 for Afghanistan. Korea had
provided 10 million dollars in 2002, 15
million dollars in 2003 and 20 million
dollars in 2004 and has successfully

concluded the assistance project. The of Technology (Kabul, March 31, 2005)
government provided an additional 1.5
million dollars in 2005 for the management and maintenance of previous projects, thus
fully dedicated itself to the reconstruction of Afghanistan.
The government plans to assist Afghanistan’s rural area development project and
public sector reformation by providing a total grant of 8 million dollars between 2006 and
2008.

4) Assistance to South Asia after the Damages Caused by the Seismic Wave

The earthquake-triggered waves in the Indian Ocean on December 26, 2004 caused over
200 thousand deaths, with 120 thousand deaths in Indonesia alone, one million refugees
and highest-ever losses in human and physical assets.
Immediately after the hit, the government decided to provide 50 million dollars to
eight countries including Indonesia and Sri Lanka. It was the largest amount of foreign

emergency aid by Korea to assist relief
activities for natural disasters. From the
committed amount of aid, the government
immediately sent 5 million dollars worth
of cash, commodities and emergency
rescue teams. The rest of the 45 million
dollars were to be sent to the damaged
states for the mid- and long-term reconstruction.

organized and systematic manner. Thus, Korea introduced the Foreign Emergent Rescue
Act and related manuals. Furthermore, faced with the unprecedented natural disaster,
Korea learned the lesson of the importance of forming alliance between government and
non-governmental organizations to help countries affected by natural disasters.

5) Relief Assistance to Pakistan after the Earthquake Damage

Immediately after the mass scale damages caused by the earthquake in Pakistan on October 8, 2005, the government made a decision to aid a total amount of 3 million dollars.
First of all, as an immediate measure, the government sent the Korea International
Cooperation Agency (KOICA) emergency rescue team to the affected areas
for relief and the governmental and
civilian rescue teams afterwards. Later,
another rescue team composed of 39
medical and rescue staff was sent for
further rescue activities.
Yet, as the death toll reached 80
thousand and the damage worsened,
international aid increased. Following

provided additional million dollars to Pakistan.
Altogether, the committed grant to Pakistan amounted to 4.2 million dollars. Apart
from the grant, a loan of 20 million dollars is under negotiations between the two countries.

6) Korea’s Initiatives for Africa’s Development

After his visit to three African countries,
President Roh Moo-hyun presented
“Korea’s Initiatives for Africa’s Development” in March 2006.
The core of the initiatives, which
includes methods to assist Africa in ten
areas, is that Korea will triple its ODA
contribution to Africa by 2008.
Furthermore, the increased budget

The government will take the initiatives to assist African development with countryspecific plans to meet each country’s demand on its economic development plan. The
initiatives have already broken the ground for the development of water resources in
order to relieve the famine in East Africa, which has been a critical humanitarian issue in
the international community.

###### 3. Future Directions of Development Cooperation

After the Korean War, Korea has successfully achieved economic development and
democratization; and within half a century, the country has become the world’s 11[th]

largest economy. Its success story is an unprecedented example of economic and social
development in modern history, and it serves as a development model for other developing countries.
For this reason, the international community calls on Korea to play a more active role.
The most urgent issue for Korea is to expand its ODA. In addition, considering that most
developed countries provide 90% of their ODA as grants, Korea also strives to increase its
grants.
Along with the increased amount of ODA, maximizing the effectiveness of its ODA
program is also an important challenge.
Korea has provided assistance to many countries in small amounts. However, later
on, it will focus on key recipient countries to concentrate its limited resources to those
countries based on the principle of “Selection and Concentration.” In addition, to keep
up with the current trend in the international development cooperation, Korea will also
pay more attention to fighting against poverty and disease in the LDCs, especially in
Africa.
Therefore, the government is considering to enact a “Basic Law of Official Development Assistance” as soon as possible, which will set the principles, objectives, and organizational coordination of the ODA.

Film Festival at the German Historical Museum in
Berlin (December 6) and Korea Fantasy Performance at the National Theater.
Both events had a special committee[1]

comprised of government officials and nongovernmental personnel to systematically reflect
experts’ and public opinions during the preparation of the events. In addition, related Ministries
and offices worked closely together to maximize
the output from a limited budget, contributing to
the success of the cultural events.

###### 2. Support for Overseas Performance of Non-governmental Art Groups

The government sent a total number of 26 nongovernmental art groups to 34 countries for important events including the 30[th] anniversary of diplomatic relations between Korea and Singapore, the
15[th] anniversary of diplomatic relations between
Korea and Czech, the 15[th] anniversary of diplomatic
relations between Korea and Russia, the 40 [th]

anniversary of diplomatic relations between Korea
and Venezuela, and the 100[th] anniversary of Korean
immigration to Mexico.

**KOREA-JAPAN UNIVERSITY STUDENT EXCHANGE PROGRAM**

Kim Hyun-suk (Hanyang University)

Although it would be difficult to mention all the experiences and lessons I have learned in Japan, I would like

to point them out it three categories.

First is the preservation of traditional culture. Despite the fact that Japan had begun its westernization much

earlier than Korea, beginning with Meiji Reform, it was interesting to note how well the cultural traditions have

been preserved. Many Japanese still often enjoy wearing the Kimono, Japanese traditional robe, and various

traditional culture activities such as Sumo, Kabuki as well as traditional Japanese food still prevail in modern

times. In addition, I found out that while we can only get to know our cultural traditions by visiting museums or

by lectures of professionals, Japanese cultural traditions have been inherited to the younger generations,

maintaining their own uniqueness.

Before my visit to Japan, I had thought only of the similarities between the two cultures, but afterwards, I

discovered that there are many differences between the two. Hence, to sum up, my experience confirmed the

old saying, “Seeing is believing.”

Second is the national characteristic of always being prepared. Our guides, Mr. Kikai, Mr. Morishita and Mr.

Sakamoto, were always perfectly ready to guide the group. It was impressive to see their punctuality and

effort to precede the program without any delay. They even cared about little things, such as providing a PDA

for translations at museums. Especially through their emphasis on manners to elders during lectures and

watching them thank the staff for their cooperation and understanding, I was able to learn about the

Japanese’s deep consideration for others. Moreover, through my meeting with the local people in Tokyo,

Kyoto and especially, Oostu, where we enjoyed the home stay, I was able to further learn of the Japanese

national characteristic of always being prepared.

Lastly, I was impressed by the Japanese transportation system and municipal administration. As an

example, there was no worry of the pedestrian road being occupied by street vendors. How well drivers

abided by the traffic signs and stop lines were also impressive. Public facilities had signs in three

languages—English, Chinese and Korean—as a

consideration for foreigners. Streets in Japan were

well-planned and equipped accordingly to the strict road

system that anybody could locate the place they wished to

go. Although the night scenes of Tokyo seemed similar to

that of Seoul, I believe the city system of Japan could be

benchmarked. The visit to Japan was significant in that it

provided me with an opportunity to better know the country

personally rather than by vague, abstracted impression and

understanding.

**Female Korean Traditional Chamber Music Group’s Performance**

Kim Ki (From an article of Ohmynews, July 10, 2005)

The Korean performance on July 5 at Al Hussein Theater in Amman, the capital of Jordan, rocked whole
Amman. Invited by the Korean Embassy in Jordan (Ambassador Shin Yoen-sung) and sponsored by the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Dasreum, the female Korean Traditional Chamber Music Group, on an
ambitious undertaking, moved the hearts of Jordanians including the Minister of Culture of Jordan as well as

  - ••••

The first part of Dasreum’s performance was mainly traditional strings combined with traditional wind
instruments, including traditional ballads and Pansori, the Korean traditional narrative songs. Beautifully
dressed with the traditional court dress, Dasreum was able to capture the audience’s attention. Although there
had been concerns that Korean traditional music might be boring for the people who are used to popular
music of Middle East with fast beats, they only turned out to be unnecessary worries. Jordanians became very
interested in Korean traditional music.

The second part of the performance was creative music performance, and the audience seemed more
relaxed than they did in the previous part. Especially, the performance touched the hearts of Koreans living in
Jordan including immigrants and students.

(ellipsis) ••••••

The performance was continued by songs written by prominent composers such as Park Bum-hoon, Lee
Jun-ho and the president of Dasreum, Yoo Eun-sun. They also performed folksongs from Ireland, Korea and
foreign performers performed songs of their country. As for the Jordanian folk song all Jordanians in the
theatre, began to sing along. As the applause continued endlessly even after the performance was over,
Dasreum had to come back to the stage and play Arirang, a traditional Korean song, and Jordanian folk song.
During the encore, while Jordanian folksongs were being played, Jordanians went up to the stage and sang

#### Promoting Multi-track Free Trade Agreements (FTA)

###### 1. Overview

Korea is recognized as a country that has made exemplary use of the multilateral trading
system established under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Since
entering the GATT in 1976, the nation pursued export oriented economic growth for
thirty years and maintained such growth—also known as the “Miracle of Han River.” In
the process, Korea heavily relied on the multilateral trading system without paying much
attention to regional trade agreements.
Yet in the process of overcoming the 1997 Asian financial crisis, Korea reevaluated its
foreign trade policy. As a result, the Korean government turned to the FTA.
Korea’s FTA policy went into effect in November 1998, with Chile as Korea’s first
FTA partner. Ever since, Korea’s FTA negotiations have expedited in pace and expanded
in scope. The Roh Moo-hyun administration strengthened the momentum by negotiating FTAs on a multi-track basis, pursuing at the same time FTAs with Japan, Singapore
and the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) respectively. In April 2004, the KoreaChile FTA came into effect, and Korea-Singapore negotiations were concluded in
November 2004, and the Korea-EFTA negotiations were concluded in July 2005.
Korea is in the course of carrying out FTA negotiations or pre-FTA discussions with

**Status of Korea’s FTA**


twenty countries including ASEAN members and Canada. In 2005, Korea achieved significant progress in negotiations with major trading partners, such as ASEAN and Canada,
and also held successful pre-FTA discussions with potential FTA partners, including India.
Building upon these results, in the first half of 2006, an agreement on trade in goods was
concluded between Korea and ASEAN and negotiations for the Korea-U.S. FTA, the
Korea-India Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) and the KoreaMexico Strategic Economic Complementation Agreement (SECA) were launched.
Meanwhile, six rounds of negotiations have taken place with Japan since December
2003, but due to Japan’s proposal of an excessively low level of concessions in agricultural
products, negotiations have been suspended without reaching an agreement in November 2004. In the future, while adhering to the position that the content of the agreement
is more important than time limit of negotiation, the government will consider resuming
talks when Japan is ready to present a positive proposal for agricultural products.

###### 2. Conclusion and Implementation of FTA

1) Successful Implementation of the Korea-Chile FTA

For the effective implementation of the Korea-Chile FTA, which came into effect on
April 1, 2004, the second Free Trade Commission (FTC), co-led by the Ministers for
Trade from Korea and Chile, was held in Jeju Island on June 3, 2005. During the FTC, the
results of the FTA were evaluated and future prospects discussed. Committees evaluated
the implementation of the agreement by each section. The increase in bilateral trade
between Korea and Chile—48.8% in the first year and 33.6% in the second year—after
the FTA came into effect, shows that the economic benefits of establishing an FTA are
becoming more visible.

1 Regional Trade Agreements (RTA) exist in two different forms. First, there is the customs union, which eliminates internal tariffs and also sets up a
common external tariff rate. Second, there is the free trade area, which only eliminates internal tariffs. The FTA, which belongs to the latter, is one of
the most common forms of regional trade agreements that are currently in effect. By expanding in scope to cover a wider range of trade, including
services, investment, intellectual property, government procurement, competition and cooperation, recent RTAs are more advanced in form than the
WTO agreement and are clearly different from traditional RTAs that were focused on tariff elimination.

2) Signing and Coming into Effect of the Korea-Singapore FTA

Korea’s FTA negotiations with Singapore started in January 2004. The finalized agreement was signed in August
2005 and came into effect on March 2,
2006.
The Korea-Singapore FTA is a
comprehensive agreement with wide
coverage, including goods, services,
investment, Mutual Recognition Agreement (MRA), government procurement, intellectual property rights and The Singing of Korea-Singapore FTA (Seoul, August 4, 2005)
cooperation. According to the KoreaSingapore FTA domestic market liberalization plan, Singapore committed itself
to eliminate tariffs on all its goods on
entry into force of the agreement and
Korea is committed to remove tariffs
on 91.6% of tariff lines within the next
ten years. In the service and investment
areas, the two countries reached a
much more comprehensive and
detailed agreement than that of the Products from the Gaesong Industrial complex labelled “Made in

Korea”

WTO by adopting the negative list
which promises liberalization in principle except in certain reserved areas. Notably, it agrees to eliminate tariffs on the products
manufactured in the Gaesong Industrial Complex, treating them as our domestic products. The agreement has become a precedent for the following FTAs—Korea-EFTA FTA
and Korea-ASEAN FTA—and an important basis for Gaesong products to secure an
external route for export.
It is expected that through the Korea-Singapore FTA and the Korea-ASEAN FTA,
national enterprises will be able to actively enter the attractive Southeast Asian market
with Singapore as the springboard.

3) Signing of the Korea-EFTA FTA

The European Free Trade Association (EFTA) consists of the four small but strong trading countries of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. The official negotiations for an FTA with EFTA started in January 2005 in Geneva and were concluded as the
Ministers for Trade from both sides signed the agreement on December 15, 2005.
Currently, domestic procedures are taking place for its effectuation.
The Korea-EFTA FTA is a comprehensive agreement that not only includes trade in
goods and services, but also financial services, intellectual property rights and competition. The Korean government is committed to reducing tariffs on 99.1% of goods, and
has agreed to the immediate tariff removal for 86.3% of goods on the entry into force of
the agreement. The EFTA agreed to eliminate tariffs on 100% of Korean goods, with the
exception of a few sensitive agricultural products, when the agreement comes into effect.
Following the precedent of the Korea-Singapore FTA, the Korea-EFTA FTA will also
eliminate tariffs on the products of the Gaesong Industrial Complex.
The Korea-EFTA FTA, as the first FTA between the European countries and a Northeast Asian country, is expected to bring mutual economic benefits for all parties involved,
based on complementary industry structure. Not only is it foreseen that Korean businesses will have better opportunity to enter the EFTA market, but it is also expected that they
will obtain an additional opportunity to enter the adjacent EU market as well. According
to the Korea Institute for International Economic Policy, once the FTA goes into effect,
the size of bilateral trade between the two partners will increase by 1.4 billion dollars.

###### 3. Pursuit of Multi-track FTA Negotiations

1) Launch of the KORUS FTA Negotiations

During the year 2005, Korea and the United States held three rounds of FTA Review
Discussions and six meetings of the trade ministers to discuss the feasibility and desirability of a bilateral FTA. As a result of those meetings, the two countries came to a common

Chapter 1. Promoting Multi-track Free Trade Agreements (FTA) | 157


-----

understanding that a bilateral FTA would
bring benefits to both countries and officially announced the launch of the
KORUS FTA negotiations on February 3,
2006.
Before entering into formal negotiating
rounds, the two sides held two informal
preparatory meetings in March and April

Korea and U.S. officially agree to hold Korea-U.S. FTA

2006. During those prior consultations, negotiations (Washington, February 3, 2006)
the two sides agreed to hold five rounds of
negotiations in 2006, to establish 17 negotiating groups and 2 working groups, to dub this
negotiation as KORUS FTA, and to keep negotiating documents confidential for 3 years
after the entry into force of the agreement while the final texts of the agreement shall be
made public upon the conclusion of the negotiations.
A dedicated negotiating team comprising about 150 government officials representing
26 government agencies was established within the government in order to conduct the
KORUS FTA negotiations, and the Office of the KORUS FTA has been set up within
MOFAT to coordinate the negotiation. Many government agencies have also set up
KORUS FTA Task Force Teams to provide necessary assistance for intra- and interagency coordination and information sharing.
The Ministerial Meeting for External Economic Affairs is being held every other week
to evaluate progress of the negotiations, to provide necessary guidance to the negotiating
team, and to review programs to assist the sectors that are expected to be adversely
affected by the result of the KORUS FTA. Furthermore, the Presidential Committee on
Facilitating KORUS FTA is established in order to garner public support for the KORUS
FTA by providing relevant information to the public and enhance their understanding of
the negotiations. The National Assembly set up the special KORUS FTA Committee to
review the negotiation process and provide its input to the government.
The successful conclusion of the KORUS FTA negotiations hinges on the support
from the relevant stakeholders and the general public. Therefore, MOFAT has sought
opinions from the relevant stakeholders and the general public by seeking their
comments and requests on the KORUS FTA through the official gazette and its designated websites from the launch of the negotiations. Through the initial comment period
which ended in May, 2006, over 190 separate comments and requests were received and

158 | 2006 Diplomatic White Paper


-----

reviewed by the negotiating team and taken into account in the negotiations.
The Korean government is making every effort to achieve a high quality free trade
agreement which strikes a balance of interests between and is acceptable to, the two
sides. At the same time, due consideration should also be given to areas with high sensitivities which need to be addressed with caution at the negotiations.

**KORUS FTA Factsheet**

**1. Why does Korea pursue a bilateral FTA with the United States?**

           - If Korea does not continue its effort to reform and liberalize, Korea cannot maintain its

competitiveness and its status as the 11[th] largest economy in the world.

            - While developed countries continue to stay steps ahead of Korea, emerging economies such as BRICs are

rapidly growing and catching up fast.

           - The United States is the largest economy in the world with an import market worth of $1.7 trillion

which is larger than that of China, Japan and ASEAN combined.

            - While China’s share in the U. S. market has increased steadily (6.1%→14.6%), Korea’s share has

decreased (3.3%→2.6%) since 1995.

           - Korea needs a new strategy in its trade policy to regain its competitiveness in the U.S. and global

**2. Expected Benefits of the KORUS FTA**

- According to the analyses by various research institutions, considerable economic gains are

expected in areas such as increase in national income, welfare, trade volume, production, and

- Intangible benefits are also expected:

- Korean consumers will be able to afford better goods and services by having a broader selection of goods

at lower prices.

- Improved access to the biggest market in the world

- Increased investment in Korea from the United States, which would bring the positive impact on the Korean

economy as it would induce technology transfers and create new jobs.

- Upgraded market economy which would enhance national competitiveness

- Strengthened bilateral relations with the United States


2) Korea-ASEAN FTA Negotiations and the Basic Agreement

At the Korea-ASEAN Summit held in
Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia in December
13, 2005, the 10 ASEAN countries
signed the Framework Agreement on
Comprehensive Economic Cooperation
with the Republic of Korea. Prior to the
agreement on December 9, 2005,
Korea-ASEAN signed an agreement on
dispute settlement and agreed upon the

The conclusion of the Korea-ASEAN FTA on trade in goods (Manila,

main content of goods agreement and May 16, 2006)
method of liberalization which was the
core of the FTA negotiations.
Although Korea started to negotiate an FTA with ASEAN relatively late compared to
other countries, the joint study on the FTA started in March 2004 and was finished in five
months. The first round of negotiations started in February 2005 and in ten months, the
two sides reached an agreement on the core content of the Korea-ASEAN FTA that
includes the general agreement, goods liberalization method and dispute settlement

160 | 2006 Diplomatic White Paper


-----

procedure agreement. By concluding the agreement in less than two years, Korea not
only overcame the disadvantage of being a late starter but also developed an important
basis for the Korea-ASEAN FTA final agreement.
In the 11[th] negotiation held in April 2006, the remaining parts of the agreement on
trade in goods including item-by-item concession schedule and rules of origin were
agreed, and thus the agreement on trade in goods was concluded. The Korea-ASEAN
FTA will be finalized once an agreement in service and investment is concluded.
The outcomes of the Korea-ASEAN FTA negotiations hold great significance for
Korea in the sense that they are the direct products of the government’s multi-track strategy for FTAs. Furthermore, in terms of policy, they will help stimulate pursuing FTAs
with the world’s largest economies such as the U.S., Japan, EU and newly rising emerging
economies such as BRICs.
The Korea-ASEAN FTA is a free trade agreement with the biggest economic and trading partners out of the FTAs that Korea has concluded until now. ASEAN is a newly
rising market of 500 million people with strong potential. It is currently Korea’s fifth
largest export market and many ASEAN countries have maintained high tariffs on Korean goods. Once the Korea-ASEAN FTA goes into effect, Korea’s exports to ASEAN in the
mid- to long-term will increase by approximately 10 billion dollars.
Furthermore, the Korea-ASEAN FTA has provided Korea with an important opportunity to establish itself as the hub of East Asian economic integration. If the Northeast
Asian market and the Southeast Asian market integrate into one, it will lay the basis for
the future development of the East Asian community.
In addition, the government reached an agreement with ASEAN on the FTA principle
of lifting tariffs on goods produced in the Gaesong Industrial Complex. Following the
FTA with Singapore and EFTA, this is the third case in which the government was able
to incorporate preferential tariff treatment for products of the Gaesong Industrial
Complex into an FTA.

3) Korea-Canada FTA Negotiations

Concluding an FTA with Canada, a member of North American Free Trade Agreement
(NAFTA), was seen as a possible entryway into the North American market. Thus, the
Korean government decided to pursue an FTA with Canada. In the Korea-Canada

Chapter 1. Promoting Multi-track Free Trade Agreements (FTA) | 161

Summit and meeting for Ministers for
Trade, which were held on the margins
of the November 2004 APEC Economic
Leaders’ Meeting, the two countries
agreed to hold government level
preparatory meetings to determine the
feasibility and appropriateness of pursuing a Korea-Canada FTA, thereby taking
the first step towards establishing a free

Second Korea-Canada FTA negotiation (Seoul, September 27-30,

trade agreement. 2005)
In the Korea-Canada meeting in
Dalian, held on occasion of the DDA small group minister-level conference in July 2005,
the Ministers for Trade from both countries agreed to launch Korea-Canada FTA negotiations. In the fifth round of negotiations held in Ottawa, April 2006, the two countries
exchanged tariff offers on goods and reservation lists for services, thereby entering into
full-fledged negotiations.
It is expected that building upon the complementary industrial structure of the two
economies, seen in Korea’s competitive manufacturing sector and Canada’s abundant
natural resource base, the conclusion of the Korea-Canada FTA will further strengthen
the mutually beneficial trade relations between the two countries. In the negotiation
process, the government will pursue to the extent possible a high level of liberalization,
while taking into consideration the sensitive sectors of our industry.

###### 4. Joint Studies on FTAs with Potential Partner Countries

1) Completion of the Korea-Mexico Joint Study and Pursuit of SECA

During President Roh’s visit to Mexico on September 9, 2005, the two heads of state
agreed to pursue a Strategic Economic Complementation Agreement (SECA). Both sides
held a preparatory meeting to start SECA negotiations in November 2005 and agreed

162 | 2006 Diplomatic White Paper


-----

upon the basic content of the negotiation in 2006. The first round of
negotiations was held on February
7-9, 2006, and the second round on
April 18-20, 2006, in Seoul and
Mexico respectively. In both
rounds, the two parties discussed
the main contents of the agreement.
Pursuing a SECA with Mexico is
expected to assist in reducing the
disadvantages that Korean businesses face in Mexico, and to create
more opportunities for them to
enter the Latin American market.


First Korea-Mexico SECA negotiation (Seoul, February 7-9, 2006)


2) Completion of the Korea-India CEPA Joint-Study and Pursuit of Negotiations

In the Summit meeting held in October, 2004, the two heads of state agreed to establish a
Korea-India Joint Study Group (JSG) and to evaluate the appropriateness and feasibility of
pursuing a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) as part of the
efforts to build a strategic partnership between the two countries through expanded
economic ties.
As a result of four JSG conferences held since January 2005, the Korean and Indian
governments adopted a joint study report recommending that the governments go ahead
with the CEPA negotiations in January, 2006. The report stated that considering the similarities in economic policies and the complementary economic structures of the two
countries, a CEPA is needed as an institutional framework for building a comprehensive
and forward-looking economic relationship between the two countries.
In this context, the report recommended that both governments pursue a comprehensive and high level CEPA that would cover trade in goods and services, facilitation of
trade and investment and economic cooperation. Accordingly, the two heads of state
initiated CEPA negotiations in February 2006 and two round of negotiations were held in
2006.

third meeting was held in March 2006 in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The final report will
be submitted to the governments of the two sides.
Once an agreement is concluded with MERCOSUR, the largest economic union in
Central and South America, Korea will gain an opportunity to enter the newly rising
market of 220 million people. In addition, by eliminating tariff barriers, Korea will be able
to secure increased exports and importing raw materials. Furthermore, it will be able to
actively respond to the intensifying trend of economic integration in the Americas.

###### 5. Fostering Conditions for Other FTAs: China, Korea-China-Japan

The Korean government has recognized that FTAs with large economies are necessary in
order to maximize economic and political effect. To this end, the government has put its
best foot forward to create favorable conditions for pursuing FTAs, while at the same
time taking into account other countries’ attitudes and maintaining a cautious and stepby-step approach.
In the Korea-China trade minister meeting held on occasion of the ASEAN+3
Economic Ministerial Conference in September 2004, the government agreed to conduct
a joint study with China, which has surfaced as Korea’s number one trade partner, in
private research institutions for two years starting in 2005, prior to holding government

Meanwhile, in the Korea-China-Japan Summit Meeting held under the ASEAN+3

the Korea-China-Japan FTA among private research institutions[4] and has since been
fulfilling this commitment diligently.

### Resolving Unfair Import Restrictions

###### 1. Active Use of the WTO Dispute Settlement Mechanism

The WTO dispute settlement mechanism is a policy tool actively used by the government when Korean businesses face difficulties in their overseas activities due to its trading
partners’ violation of the WTO agreements and when complaints are brought against
Korea’s economic system and trade measures.
Up until 2005, Korea has been involved in twenty-three disputes: as a complainant in
twelve cases against the U.S., EC and Japan; and as a respondent in eleven cases instituted
by the U.S., EC, Indonesia, etc. Of the fourteen cases in which Panel and Appellate Body
Reports were issued, Korea won ten and lost four cases, recording a success rate of
71.4%.
There were six cases of dispute in 2005. While Korea lost in the case of the U.S.-Countervailing Duty DRAMs when the Panel’s decision was reversed by the Appellate Body,
Korea won or partially won four cases including EC-Measures Affecting Commercial
Vessels, EC-Countervailing Measures on DRAMs and Indonesia-Anti-Dumping Duties
on Paper. In the case of Japan-Import Quotas on Laver, Korea and Japan reached a mutual agreement on January 20, 2006, which was a few days before the Panel interim report
was to be released. Korea was considered as winning this case.

tional.
Korea won both cases, as a respondent and a complainant, with the EC in Commercial Vessels, which had been its major outstanding dispute with the EC since 1999. Since
then, our shipbuilding industry has been free of subsidy disputes with the EC, Japan and
other competitors. As a result we have been able to secure the basis in maintaining the
number one position in the world market in terms of receipt of orders.
The case of Indonesia-Anti-Dumping Duties on Paper is the first action taken against
Korea in the area of anti-dumping. Yet the Panel ruled that the Korea Trade Commission’s anti-dumping decision did not violate the WTO Anti-Dumping Agreement other
than a few procedural matters. The case served to enhance confidence in the Korea
Trade Commission internationally.
The case of Japan-Import Quotas on Laver was the first WTO dispute between Korea
and Japan. In the dispute settlement process, when it became clear that Japan would lose
the case, Japan promised to increase the imported quota on laver for Korea to 1.2 billion
sheets (12 million sok, 1 sok = 100 sheets) over the next ten years (which is five times the
amount in 2004), and Korea accepted this. As a result, exports by our laver industry will
no longer face low quotas, thus contributing to higher incomes for Korean fishermen.
Despite the Appellate Body’s ruling against Korea in the case of U.S.-Countervailing
Duty on DRAMs, the Panel’s favorable decision in November 2004 served Hynix positively, as the company was able to normalize its operations by making effective use of the
seven months following the Panel’s ruling.

###### 2. Participation in Disputes as a Third Party

Korea is also guarding against possible future intrusion of its trade interests by participating as a third party in disputes where no direct, but substantial interests for the country
are at stake.
In 2005, Korea was a third party in the following disputes: U.S. • EC-Measures Affecting Trade in Large Civil Aircraft, EC-Selected Customs Matters, U.S.-Zeroing (challenged
by EC) U.S.-Zeroing (challenged by Japan), and EC-Countervailing Measures on Certain

### Participation in WTO DDA Round

###### 1. Developments of DDA1 Negotiations in 2005

In 2005, DDA negotiations took place at both the working-level and the ministerial-level[2]

every two months in Geneva.
At the end of January, preliminary talks were held at Davos, Switzerland, to discuss
the goals of the 6[th] WTO Ministerial Conference to be held in Hong Kong in December.
As a result, the parties reached an agreement on the principle to produce substantial and
balanced outcome in six areas—agriculture, NAMA (Non-agricultural Market Access),
services, rules, trade facilitation and development.
However, technical issues regarding the agricultural sector stymied further progress in
the negotiations, consequently affecting other areas. Thus, at the ministerial-level Green
Room talks held in Geneva early November, it was concluded that it would be difficult to
reach the initial levels of agreement over negotiating modalities in agriculture and
NAMA at the conference in Hong Kong. With the common understanding that the
pursuit of further commitment to liberalization would only break down the Hong Kong
meeting, the participating countries agreed to lower their level of expectations for the

1 DDA (Doha Development Agenda) negotiations refer to the WTO multilateral trade talks in process since 2002, after the Doha Ministerial Declaration
was announced in November 2001.

2 Ministerial-level talks were held with the aim of boosting the political drive behind the negotiations by directly involving the ministers, and seeking
out room for breakthroughs on key issues. Trade ministers from 20-30 of the 148 WTO member states were invited to attend.

Hong Kong Ministerial Conference, while maintaining
the level of targeted outcome for the DDA talks.
The 6[th] WTO Ministerial Conference was held in
Hong Kong from December 13-18. The meeting
focused on development issues, producing a package
agreement on cotton subsidies, implementation period and scope of items subject to duty-free and quotafree for the least-developed countries, and aid for
trade. Furthermore, the participating Ministers agreed
on the elimination of agricultural export subsidies by
2013. They also agreed to some follow-up measures,
such as the schedule for future negotiations and the
monitoring of the July package, laying the groundwork to expedite further talks.

###### 2. Negotiations by Sector

1) Agriculture


Minister for Trade, Kim Hyun-chong speaks
at the WTO 6[th] Ministerial Conference (Hong
Kong, December 14, 2005)


In the midst of contentious positions held between member states on agricultural issues,
the DDA negotiations in agriculture revolved around the following 3 main objectives:

###### • Substantial improvements in market access
 • Reduction of, with a view to phasing out, all forms of export subsidies
 • Substantial reductions in trade-distorting domestic support

The Hong Kong Ministerial Conference held in December 2005 failed to satisfy the
initial goal of reaching an agreement on the modalities for agricultural negotiations.
However, developed countries agreed to eliminate all forms of export subsidies by 2013.
Member states also agreed on the number of bands for agricultural subsidies and tariff

-----

reductions, building the framework to spur further talks next year by making the agreements official in the form of a Ministerial Declaration.
Korea, as the host economy of the 2005 APEC Economic Leaders’ Meeting, played a
leading role in bringing about the adoption of a special statement calling upon the
complete phase-out of developed countries’ agricultural export subsidies by 2010. This
statement is regarded as having been a critical step in setting the end-date for the elimination of agricultural export subsidies, which is the most remarkable achievement of the
Hong Kong meeting.
As a net-importer of agricultural goods, Korea focused on securing flexibility in the
DDA agricultural negotiations in order to minimize possible damage to the domestic
agricultural sector arising from market liberalization. Korea strengthened its consultation
with the G-10 (agriculture importing countries) and G-33 (special products group) in
order to reflect its position on issues of vital interest, such as tariff reduction rates and
sensitive products.

2) NAMA[3]

Tariff reduction formula, sectoral negotiations, and non-tariff barriers were discussed in
NAMA negotiations in 2005. The Ministers at the Hong Kong Ministerial Conference in
December 2005 failed to reach an agreement on the modalities of NAMA negotiations.
However, the assessment on the process after the July package was made public with the
Ministerial Declaration, and the detailed negotiation schedule for 2006 was outlined to
step up the drive for future talks.
Given that trade accounts for more than 70% of Korea’s GDP, Korea strived to
demand for a reduction in the high tariff rates of developed and developing countries.
Korea also focused on sectoral liberalization and non-tariff barrier elimination negotiations by working in coordination with the Ambitious Friends Group, the members in
pursuit of achieving a high degree of liberalization.

3 A comprehensive discussion for the purposes of reducing and eliminating tariff barriers such as tariff-peaks, high-tariffs, tariff-escalation and
non-tariff barriers on non-agricultural products (manufactured, forest and marine products) is in process. Korea and developed countries are calling
for the reduction of the relatively high tariff rates imposed by developing countries. However, developing countries are demanding the elimination of
developed countries’ tariff and other barriers imposed on the former’s competitive product group (usually items subject to tariff-peaks in developed
countries), while pushing hard to secure preferential treatment in terms of the degree of tariff reduction and implementation period.

Chapter 3. Participation in WTO DDA Round | 175


-----

3) Services

Service negotiations deal with 12 sectors, 155 sub-sectors including legal, educational, and
medical services. The final settlement of sub-sectors comes after member states exchange
requests for market opening and offer concessions. Afterwards, the negotiations follow
on the basis of the request and offer.
However, the inherent limitations of such non-binding bilateral exchanges
(Request/Offer) and negative linkage tactics practiced by certain member states in agricultural negotiations stood in the way of any advancement in services talks. In December
2005, concerned states agreed to adopt the plurilateral Request/Offer that enables collective negotiations, which was expected to serve as a catalyst for advancing service talks.
The service industry will become the new driving force for the Korean economy. In
particular, the service sector is instrumental to spurring competitiveness in the manufacturing industry. The government is actively participating in the service negotiations to
sharpen the competitive edge of the Korean economy and promote overseas expansion
of domestic businesses.

4) Others

Negotiations in other areas include trade rules, trade facilitation, development/implementation, intellectual properties, and the environment. In particular, in the field of trade
rules, discussions on how to clarify and improve the Anti-dumping Agreement, Agreement on Subsidy and Countermeasures, and articles related to regional agreements in
GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) and GATS (General Agreement on
Trade in Services) were in progress. In the area of anti-dumping, Korea has established a
“Friends” group with other members having common interests and concerns, including
Japan, Switzerland and Hong Kong. The Friends demanded substantial improvement in
the current agreement to curb unwarranted use of anti-dumping measures. On the other
hand, the U.S. maintained a defensive stance, holding on to a minimalist approach to any
changes.
In the area of trade facilitation, members negotiated the means by which to improve
customs procedures for the purpose of promoting trade. To this end, discussions to clarify and improve GATT articles 5, 8 and 10 were conducted. Korea, the U.S., Japan, EC,

176 | 2006 Diplomatic White Paper


-----

Canada, Australia, Switzerland and other developed countries have formed the Colorado
Group and took part in the negotiations as leading participants.
The development/implementation part was centered on a total of 88 Agreementspecific proposals submitted by developing and least-developed country Members
(LCDs), which were concerned with enhancing the content and efficacy of the special
and differential treatment provisions for developing countries in the WTO agreements.
Furthermore, members also reviewed problems that have arisen in the implementation
process of the WTO agreements and discussed ways to ensure the agreement’s proper
implementation.
Of the 88 Agreement-specific proposals on special and differential treatment provisions, five proposals submitted by the least-developed country Members were agreed on
at the Hong Kong Ministerial Conference. One of the five LDC Agreement-specific
proposals was that developed-country Members shall, and developing-country Members
declaring themselves in a position to do so should provide duty-free and quota-free
market access for at least 97% of the products originating from LDCs, defined at the tariff
line level, by 2008 or no later than the start of the implementation period of the final
DDA package.
In the field of Intellectual Property Rights, negotiations concerning the Geographical
Indication (GI) system were in progress. Geographical Indication is a system to protect
producers and consumers by identifying a good as originating in a territory when a given
quality, reputation or other characteristic of the good is essentially attributable to its
geographical origin. The contentious debate between the old continental states (EC etc.)
and the new ones (U.S., Australia etc.) stood in the way of making progress for a productive discussion. The former sought to widen the scope of products subject to special
protection—now limited to only wine and spirits—and suggested a multilateral system of
notification and registration of geographical indications to that end, while the latter
opposed any such measure.
Environment negotiations dealt with the relationship between the existing WTO
rules and those of Specific Trade Obligations (STO) stipulated in the Multilateral Environmental Agreement (MEA). The discussions also addressed the issue of liberalizing
environmental goods and services. Particularly in 2005, the issue of defining environmental goods for the purpose of liberalizing that category was the subject of intense discussion.
At the end of 2005, nine countries including Korea submitted a list of 480 environmen

tal goods subject to liberalization. However, no real progress was made due to the
disagreement over the approach to liberalization.
The Ministerial Declaration of Hong Kong only rendered general guidelines for a
speedy end to the meetings, without giving any direction to the two diverging approaches[4] in question.

###### 3. Korea’s Performance in the Negotiations

As 70% of Korea’s GDP relies on trade, a successful conclusion of the DDA negotiations
is critically needed to guarantee a stable and favorable environment for trade. To this
end, the government is committing its unrelenting efforts to advance the DDA negotiations.
In June 2005, as the host of the APEC Trade Ministers Meeting, Korea prompted the
reaching of an agreement on NAMA. In the November APEC Economic Leaders’ Meeting, Korea played a leading role in adopting a separate statement while successfully
producing an agreement on the phase-out schedule of agricultural export subsidies.
Furthermore, Korea contributed to advancing the DDA negotiations by taking the
initiative in various preliminary ministerial talks. Notably in 2005, the country led the
scene in reaching an agreement on the _ad valorum equivant (AVE)[5]_ calculating method
during the negotiations on agriculture at the OECD’s mini-ministerial talks. In the capacity as the Chair of the Council for TRIPS, Korea also took the center stage in extending
the implementation period of TRIPS obligations and settling key issues relating to pharmaceutical imports for developing countries. In addition, Minister for Trade, Kim Hyunchong was the facilitator in the service negotiations at the Hong Kong Ministerial Conference and led the talks to reach a final agreement on the services section of the Ministerial

4 Developed Countries support the ‘List Approach’ where each state present a list of environmental goods. On the other hand, developing countries
prefer the ‘Multiple Approach’ taken by India; this method is a project-based approach where environmental goods employed for specific
environmental projects would be liberalized only temporarily.

5 In DDA negotiation on agriculture, it was deemed necessary to convert unit tax (won per kg) into ad valorum duty (% of import value) since different
reduction rates would be applied according to the product category.

Korea has made the utmost
endeavors to reflect its national

sectors. More specifically, as a

###### Attracting Foreign Investment and Supporting the Overseas Business Activities

 1. Attracting Foreign Investment

Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) generates positive effects for the economy such as
increasing the host country’s output, creating employment and allowing for the transfer
of relevant technology and management know-how in the recipient industries. Recognizing the importance of FDI, the government has taken various measures to attract foreign
investment, striving to improve the domestic investment environment as well as to
create favorable conditions for investment and promote further open investment policies
overseas.
With the Rules on Support for overseas Business Activities enacted in April 1998,
MOFAT is providing information about Korea’s investment environment to the
investors abroad. Furthermore, through the functions of the Trade and Investment
Promotion Task Force set up in the diplomatic missions abroad, the Ministry is anticipating domestic market to continue to generate highly attractive investment opportunities
in the future.
In particular, MOFAT has supported the holding of international road shows organized between the relevant government agencies and private economic organizations. In
addition, investment promotion teams composed of central and local government agen

As a result, FDI inflow in the year 2005 reached approximately $11.6 billion (based on
reported levels). Though the figure is slightly lower than that of the previous year ($12.8
billion), it nevertheless exceeded the 7-year average since the 1997 financial crisis ($11.3
billion). In terms of the number of investment projects, the year 2005 recorded a total of
3,707, an increase of more than 500 projects every year since the launch of the Participatory Government.

###### 2. Support for Overseas Business Activities

MOFAT is assisting in the efforts of domestic small- and medium-sized enterprises
(SMEs) to develop new international markets, expand overseas markets, and to facilitate
overseas business activities. In order to establish a system to assist and cooperate with the
private sector, the Ministry has signed MOUs with the Korea Chamber of Commerce and
Industry and the Korea Federation of Small and Medium Business[1].

1 Since 2004, MOUs have been signed with four private-sector economic organizations. MOUs were concluded with the Federation of Korean
Industries and Korea International Trade Association in 2004. The Korea Federation of Small and Medium Business entered into an MOU with MOFAT
on May 23, 2005 and the Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry entered into an MOU with MOFAT on July 15, 2005.

Moreover, in order to lay the
groundwork for the support of overseas
activities of Korean enterprises and to
diversify export markets, the government, together with local governments
and private economic organizations,
has been dispatching the Joint Public

since 1998. The South-West Asia Delegation visited India, Thailand and
Indonesia, while the European delega- MOFAT and the Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry enter

and a CIS delegation to Kazakhstan and
Uzbekistan. Moreover, a total of seven joint delegations were dispatched to prominent
international exhibitions and expos, including the Beijing Hi-Tech Expo and Tokyo
Game Show 2006.[2] The dispatch of such delegations has greatly contributed to expanding
the business horizons for promising SMEs with outstanding technology and competitiveness but lack of international networking and marketing capacities.
Furthermore, with a view to encouraging cooperation in the IT industry between
Korea and China, the “e-Government Conference: the fifth Korea-China IT Industry
Exchange” took place in Shanghai and Beijing November 22-25, 2005. The event offered
an introduction of an exemplary _e-government model and exchanges of know-how,_
corporate PR and one-on-one business consulting with participating Chinese enterprises.
Twenty-two domestic IT firms in high technology and skills participated in this event. It
offered valuable opportunities for export contracts, and the forging of ties among interested firms.
MOFAT, by using overseas missions as the beachhead for promotion, also strives to
resolve trade conflicts while promoting the growth of domestic businesses abroad. It has
engaged in exchanges of information on current trends in the economic and trade field
and has also investigated on trade disputes and the difficulties facing domestic companies.
The Ministry strives to resolve these problems through the Trade and Investment
Promotion Teams.

###### Securing Steady Supply of Energy Resources and Policies for Negotiations on Climate Change

 1. Diplomacy for Energy and Resources

1) Overview

As the world’s fourth largest importer and 7[th] largest consumer of crude oil, Korea is
highly dependent on oil imports which take up most (96.5%) of the nation’s energy
supply. Therefore, securing a steady supply of energy and energy resources is of foremost
national concern, as it constitutes a vital part of national security.
In 2005, Korea imported a total value of $66.7 billion energy sources (25.5% of $261.2
billion in total imports), a 33.5% rise from the previous year. Such an amount overwhelmingly exceeds the total value of the nation’s two leading export items—semiconductors and automobiles ($30 billion)—combined.
Average world oil prices (Dubai Oil[1] standards) reached $49.4 per barrel, and is on the
rise owing to the structural element of rapid increase in world demand for oil and insuffi
1 Dubai oil refers to the crude oil produced in United Arab Emirates. Korea takes Dubai oil prices as the standard of measurement since 70% of its
crude oil imports come from the Middle East.

cient surplus production to satisfy the demand, and political unrest in the Middle East,
Africa and other major oil producing countries ($65 as of June 2006).[2] The rising oil prices
pushes up production costs of export goods, worsening the terms of trade and may
adversely contribute to weakening Korea’s growth potential. To effectively evade possible damage to the economy, it is necessary to diversify import channels, instead of heavily depending on the volatile Middle East.
The government is making an all-out effort in securing energy sources through various diplomatic instruments of summit meetings, high-level visits and support for private

around the Aral sea (estimated gas depository to be 8 trillion cu ft.). Korea Resources
Corporate and the Uzbekistan State Committee on Geology and Mineral Resources
concluded an the MOU with plans to set up a joint venture on the development of the
Zapadno goldmines (60 tons in estimates) and Jantuar uranium (approximately 26,000
tons) deposits.

**• State Visits to Mexico and Costa Rica**
Following the state visit to Mexico[5] in September 2005, Korea signed an MOU with Mexico in organizing an inter-governmental resource committee. As such, a base for systematic cooperation has been established with the agreement on the joint development of
mineral resources and technological cooperation. Both countries exchanged Letter of

in Mexico in time with its increasing SOC investment.
State visit to Costa Rica occasioned another MOU between the Latin American Energy Organization (OLADE) and the Korea Energy Economics Institute along with Korea
Institute of Energy Research. Series of engagements following the state visits served as a
stepping stone for setting in motion future technology exchanges with resource-rich
countries in Latin America such as Brazil, Chile and Venezuela.

**• State Visits to Malaysia and the Philippines**
In December 2005, President Roh Moo-hyun made a state visit to Malaysia[6] where
national oil companies of both countries agreed to carry out joint oil development
projects. Agreement also reached in joint study of Bio-diesel with the use of palm oil.
His visit to the Philippines[7] resulted in a cooperative framework comprising agreements on energy and mineral resources. In particular, the MOU concerning the enlargement of IIijan Electric Power Station would grow the Korea Electric Power Corp. to be
the number one private electricity supplier (2,650MW) in the Philippines.

**(2) Prime Minister’s Visits to the Middle East**

Prime Minister Lee Hae-chan made a
round of visits to five Middle Eastern countries including the United Arab Emirates,
Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Oman
from November 21 to December 2, 2005.
Throughout the visits, diplomatic efforts
were made regarding the energy sector

regions have secured oil and gas supply from these areas.

**(3) Foreign Minister’s Visits to Africa**

Foreign Minister Ban Ki-moon made a series of official visits to Algeria, Tanzania, Kenya
and Libya with an eye to enhance friendly relations with Africa which is attracting worldwide attention as a continent rich with energy resources. The visits to the four countries
were particularly notable in that it was the first ever made by Korea’s Foreign Minister
which marked the widening horizons of energy diplomacy.
In August 2005, a consortium comprising the Korea National Oil Corp. and others
won the Nigerian government tender for the development of new marine mine areas,
gas supply stations and gas pipe constructions, estimated deposits of a total of 2 billion
barrels. The deposits are of an immense volume, amounting to 2.5 times the annual
crude oil import (800 million barrels).

**(4) Research Team Dispatches and Systematic Energy**
**Resource Development Overseas**

As part of the follow-up measures to the state visits to Latin America, the Government
dispatched research teams to Brazil, Argentina and Chile. The team discussed with the
Resource Cooperation Committee and other government bodies on ways to building a
cooperative system and sought for plans to give more presence for Korean enterprises in
Latin American resource development projects.
In November 2005, the Caspian Sea Resource Cooperation team was sent to Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Azerbaijan for the purpose of examining the terms of the agreements while building the foundations for resource cooperation with Azerbaijan, the key
spot for oil transport.
On the other hand, as a follow-up to the summit meetings, bilateral contacts over
wide areas of energy interests with resource-rich countries were sustained through the
instrument of the Committee on Resource Cooperation.
The Ministry has designated and is running 31 energy resource bases in countries with
the presence of Korean overseas missions. These missions serve to facilitate information
gathering of policies and government tender in concerned areas, giving weight to diplomatic policy-making and overseas resource development businesses of domestic enter

2005 was an active year in multilateral energy
diplomacy. Korea’s share in the activities was to
take part in the collective action to release emer- _Energy Status of Major Countries and Energy_

gency oil stocks, hosting the APEC Economic
Leaders’ Meeting and Ministerial conference on
energy as well as promoting energy cooperation in East Asia.
In September 2, 2005, IEA (International Energy Agency) made a request to the
member states for the release of oil stocks to prevent volatility in oil prices, in light of the
disrupted oil supplies in the Gulf of Mexico caused by Hurricane Katrina. The government released a total of 2.9 million barrels of crude oil and petrochemicals during the
period of September 10[th]-30[th] in response to the request. The collective release of oil
stocks by the IEA member states was the first ever attempt made to overcome the
demand-supply imbalance that demonstrated a promising sight of cooperation at the
international level.
The APEC Economic Leaders’ Meeting held in Busan in November 2005 addressed
concerns for recent oil price hikes and shared views in the necessity for collective efforts.
Prior to the APEC Economic Leaders’ Meeting, the 7[th] APEC Ministerial Conference
in energy was held on October 19, to discuss ways of countering the rising oil prices that
culminated in the Ministerial Declaration on energy.
The East Asian region falls behind the EU and the Americas in its system of cooperation. Hence, in 2005 the government tried to establish the basis for an East Asian Energy
Dialogue with major energy partners—the U.S., China, Russia and Japan. With Russia, in
particular, the government planned to hold Energy Talks at Ministerial level.

###### 2. Negotiations on Climate Change

The Kyoto Protocol
entered into force on
February 16, 2005.
Thirty-eight developed countries and
economies in transition are obligated to
reduce greenhouse
gas (GHG) emissions
by 5.2% from the 1990
levels over the first

APEC Business and Climate Change & second Asia Region Climate and Energy Workshops

commitment period (Seoul, April 11-13, 2005)
of 2008-2012. There
have been a wide range of detailed discussions on possible measures to address global
climate change after 2012.
Although Korea does not have any reduction targets under the Kyoto Protocol, it
ranks 10[th] in the world in terms of GHG emissions. Taking this into account, Korea has
made various efforts to participate in international negotiations related to climate change
in a way to achieve both economic growth and sustainable development.
As part of such efforts, the government hosted the APEC Business and Climate
Change Workshop in Seoul in April 2005, to discuss ways to encourage the participation
of relevant industries in efforts to address climate change and ways to develop and deploy
energy efficiency and low-carbon technologies in cooperation with the U.S., Japan and
Australia.
Furthermore, the 11[th] Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change (COP11), as well as the first Conference of the Parties as
a Meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (MOP1) took place in Montreal, from
November 28 to December 9, 2005, marking the official commencement of the Kyoto
Protocol regime with the approval of the Marrakech Accords, which include measures
for the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol. In the meeting, the parties agreed to form
the Ad Hoc Working Group (AWG) to discuss further commitments for the countries
included in the Annex I of the Convention after 2012. In addition, an agreement was

promote the development and deployment of clean technologies to both achieve sustainable development and address the challenge of climate change. In a meeting on July 28,
2005, in Laos, the Partnership adopted the Vision Statement, under the participation of
the Ministers of six countries in the Asia-Pacific region—the U.S., Australia, China, India,
Korea and Japan. Since its official launch in January 2006, the Partnership plans to
compose Task Forces and initiate detailed discussions on technology cooperations in
major industries which emit large amount of GHGs.

### Consular Services for the Protection of Korean Nationals

###### 1. Establishing a System to Protect Korean Nationals Abroad

MOFAT, taking seriously the criticism that arose in the process of handling incidents
abroad, established new legal and other support systems to address the shortcomings.
The new system has enabled a systematic response at the governmental level to effectively deal with future cases, while infusing into the Ministry a new vitality to embrace the
people, placing them at the center of its activities.
As such, an efficient system for safeguarding Koreans abroad has been established. Its
main functions are the following: providing Korean nationals abroad with the Short
Message Service (SMS) in case of emergency situations, establishing a Consular Call
Center to receive and process cases of accidents, sharing information, and dispatching
rapid response teams.
Through such measures, the Ministry seeks to protect Koreans who are affected by
incidents and accidents by offering them prompt assistance from initial measures to
follow-up procedures, while actively engaging in public relations to prevent further incidents. The efforts have been well received by both the foreign and the domestic media,
as Korean nationals, through the rapid systemic response, were well protected from the
London bombings (July 2005), Hurricane Katrina (September 2005) and the Bali bombings (October 2005).

Chapter 1. Consular Services for the Protection of Korean Nationals | 199

###### 2. Major Achievements and Improvements

1) Consular Call Center

Whenever a Korean staying abroad is facing difficulties, a request for assistance can be
made with a single phone call from anywhere in the world to the Consular Call Center
which opened on April 1, 2005. The duties of the Call Center range from assisting Koreans in emergency situations, dealing with emergencies or accidents to passports, notarization, emigration and other areas falling into the category of consular services around the
clock. Korea is the world’s first in running such Call Center to provide comprehensive
consular services.
In particular, through the functions of the Call Center, it proved possible to verify the
whereabouts of Koreans abroad during major incidents in the year 2005.[1] These valuable
functions have served to generate greater public awareness of the Call Center, with the
number of calls to the centers reaching a monthly average of 10,000 by January 2006.
In the future, calls to Korean overseas missions after office hours will be processed
through the Call Center. Additionally, MOFAT is taking steps to promote the use of Call
Center in Korean communities, Korean enterprises, religious groups, student bodies for
those studying abroad, etc.

2) Rapid Response Team

A Rapid Response Team was formed on April 4, 2005 to provide efficient and immediate
protection of Koreans involved in a major accident or incident. For this purpose, the
Ministry has selected and trained around 60 working-level officials at MOFAT as
members of the Rapid Response Team. When Hurricane Katrina hit the U.S. last
September and placed a number of Koreans in danger, the Team was promptly
dispatched to the scene in order to collect information on possible Koreans casualties,
locate their whereabouts and support rescue efforts.
The Ministry will continue to protect Korean nationals by means of proactive and
systematic operations in dealing with unfortunate incidents and accidents.

3) Overseas Emergency Alert System

MOFAT has established and operated a system that sends alert messages through a cell
phone roaming service to travelers in the event of an emergency since May 16, 2005. At
present, the service covers eighty-one countries. Korea is the first in the world to provide
such information via cell phones.
Furthermore, in case that a traveler is registered in the roaming service, the Consular
Call Center automatically sends information with the latest updates on accidents in the
area.[2]

**The Activities of the Rapid Response Team in Katrina-Scarred Regions**
(Article in the State Briefing on September 20, 2005)

Yu Min (PR Officer, Consulate of the Republic of Korea in LA)

The activities of the Ministry’s Rapid Response Team to assist Koreans in the affected region in the United
States of America are attracting attention, with such efforts well received among Korean residents in New
Orleans, the region hit hardest by the vicious hurricane. Even the State government held the team in high
regard, as they commented that the “dispatch of the team from the Korean government was timely.” There
was recognition that the government went out of its way to protect the people, while the officials learned from
the experience the value of public diplomacy that interacting with the people and enabling them to understand
the situation at hand was a central instrument of diplomatic efforts. Another reason the team attracted so
much attention was that it represented the first government attempt to provide active protection and support
in areas in which the Koreans were in danger after the late Kim Sun-il fell victim to terrorists in Iraq. The team
exerted an all out effort, recognizing that its activities would set a precedent for future incidents and had a
direct bearing on the confidence people have in their government.

**A Shabby Two-Room Apartment as an Office and Lodgings**

The Team, which was on duty for two weeks, comprised a wide range of government officials equipped for
rescue and relief activities. It is technically a Government Rapid Response Team. Let’s have a look around the
Team’s office at 7 a.m., September 12. The shabby apartment on the second floor barely over 15-pyoung
(approximately 533 sq.ft.), with two rooms used both as an office and lodgings, is situated at Baton Rouge,
approximately 50 miles from the scene of the damage. In one room, a meeting is taking place early in the
morning, where the members are checking the instructions received from headquarters and planning the
routine for the day. The members confirm the mission and one by one, set off for the scene of the damage and
to the church in the Baton Rouge neighborhood where affected Koreans are gathered.
As small as the rooms may be, the place functions as well as any other overseas mission. Satellite phones
capable of 24-hour communication anywhere in the world and other systems are all set.
The office houses the communication
facilities most important in disaster areas.
Considering the poor conditions in the
area, with no cell phone connection or

functioning office. For those reasons, the
Team earned its epithet as a ‘mobile
consulate’ amongst the locals, capable of
handling any task. For the Team, it is at
once a control room, and a center for

**Immediate Measures for the Injured at Arrival**

The six members of the Team arrived at the site on the night of September 2, three days after the hurricane
swept the region. The members from within the United States and headquarters in Korea opened an office
immediately after their arrival and went into action soon after installing the communications facilities. The
Team Leader and the members sought to get a grasp of the situation by contacting the injured and local
government officials. The first stage of the damage was analyzed from various angles and reported to the
headquarters, after which the members organized themselves according to tasks. On the third, the day after
their arrival, the team surveyed the devastated sites in New Orleans with Consul General of Houston Min
Dong-seok and Consul Shin Seung-ki. Possible remedial measures were classified to be recommended to the
headquarters. The feasibility of relief operations were examined by the Team and the Consul General, while
channels for contact were established with the host country, as speedy identification was a crucial task for the

government was the first we have met so far”, holding high regard for the government’s timely response. The
State government authorities as well as the Ambassador maintained contact channels with the Team. Through
these channels, information on the state of damage, rescue operations and their developments were

**With its Capacities and Sincerity, seen as “a perfect service to the Korean people”**

Traveling several hundred miles a day over the vast expanse of the affected areas, the Rapid Response Team,
together with officers from the Consulate General in Houston, poured its energy into conducting field
investigations, as well as confirming and reporting property damage suffered by Koreans. Further, Consul Shin
Seung-ki, other officers of the General Consulate in Houston, the Consular Call Center counselors and those in
the headquarters, acted in concert, in accordance with the established system, which was pivotal to locating
the whereabouts of the affected Koreans. To buttress the efforts, the Team strived to establish cooperative
channels with the State and the Federal governments at a very early stage, an achievement greatly
appreciated by the locals as a trustful measure of service. The overall comment from within and out of the
region was that it constituted problem-solving capability and sincerity of the highest possible standard.
However, there is a room for improvement. Several operational issues surfaced and required full
discussion, some of which included the confusion in the line of order (whether it was a MOFAT team or a
pan-governmental entity) and the size of the Team itself.

### Public Diplomacy: Embracing the People

###### 1. Expanding Dialogue with the Public

With the advent of globalization and the information age, there has been a sharp rise in
the number of Koreans traveling abroad. As such, there has been an increasing interest in
foreign policy and trade issues, with NGOs and citizens seeking a much larger presence in
diplomatic activities. Consequently, it is now widely acknowledged that diplomacy without public support is futile, which in turn led the Ministry to realize the importance of
understanding and reflecting the opinions of ordinary people.
To keep pace with the changing
foreign policy environment, the
Ministry has designated the two-way
communication channels with citizens,
along with cooperative systems with
NGOs and regions of the country, as
one of the tasks to be accomplished in
2005. The Ministry has strived to depart
from one-way delivery of information Diplomatic Outreach on Children’s Day (Seoul, May 5, 2005)

regions. In 2005, a total of thirty-two foreign policy lecture circuits were held in twentytwo cities. In the sessions, the Ministry was able to gather suggestions and comments on
foreign policy issues and then subsequently inform the participants of the results of their
feedback. Taking a step further, the participants were enlisted as customers of MOFAT
policy information services, serving as channels for sustained two-way communication.
Secondly, to provide
detailed and timely information and promote it as a public
forum, the existing MOFAT
homepages[1] underwent an
overhaul with the introduction
of enhanced user-friendly
features in May 2005.

will continue to contribute to the embodiment of the opinions of the public, reflecting
the views of ordinary people in policy-formation and implementation.

###### 2. Building Overseas Information Network

In July 2005, the Ministry developed the
Overseas Information Network with
the help of the National Intelligence
Service and the National Security
Council to facilitate sharing of useful
information gathered from overseas
missions. After two months’ test period,
the network launched its full operation
in December. Sixty-nine overseas
missions and thirty-four government Overseas Information Network homepage
bodies are currently connected to the
network.
The Network is an unprecedented system to provide real-time communication
between government staffs at home and abroad. As of May 2006, 3,511 information items
spanning fourteen areas—such as foreign policy and security, economy, trade, overseas
innovation, and Dokdo—were distributed through the system to help government officials make use of such information. As such, the system contributes to improving the
quality of governmental policies.
The Network is also able to serve as a venue for gathering and spreading information
on successful overseas innovation cases. The system is expected to bring substantial
improvements in the way the government is run as well as the services provided to the
people.
Civil servants at home can go online and access real-time information posted by overseas missions through the Network. Civil servants at home can ask for information to
those working abroad through the ‘knowledge pool’, and the ‘opinion posting’ function
allows them to assess the usefulness of the information provided and share opinions on

certain issues as well.
In 2006, which is the second phase of the project, emphasis will be put on quality
control of information distributed through the Network and establishment of a useroriented management system.

###### Building Consular Services System to Meet the Needs of the People as Consumers

 1. Creating Service-Minded Organizational Culture at all Levels

1) Enhanced Consular Services Implementation and Education/Training

To meet the expectations and win the full
confidence of the people, the Ministry has
strived to introduce innovations in its organizational culture and ensure better
consular services at all levels.
For this purpose various training
sessions have been held—one-day consular
training sessions, discussion forums, and
the assessment of amicability—to raise

Meeting of Consul-Generals (Seoul, March 30, 2006)

awareness and develop interactive consular
skills.

Chapter 1. Building Consular Services System to Meet the Needs of the People as Consumers | 213


-----

2) Publication of Cases on Consular Activity Innovations

The Ministry, seeking to build a system for the provision of outstanding consular services, designated the
year 2005 as ‘the year of diplomacy in the hands of the
people.’
One important step has been the publication of
_Cases on Consular Activity Innovations, a compilation of_
successful instances of consular services improvements
in MOFAT headquarters and overseas missions. The
edition provides detailed accounts of the creation of
hardware and the sharing of software developed for
the smooth operation of consular systems.

###### 2. Improvements of Consular Services

1) The e-Consul System


_Cases on Consular Activity Innovations_
published on May 2005


From December 2004, the Ministry has been operating the e-Consul system to connect
overseas missions with the government network, making one-stop service readily available for Korean overseas missions. The services include the retrieval of family register
documents, registration of residency, verification of immigration records, identity and
driving license records, and other administrative services.
Thanks to the e-Consul system, the processing of civil applications can now be
handled on a real time basis, reducing the previous waiting period of more than a week.
Currently sixty-seven overseas missions are connected to the e-Consul network, and it
will be made available to other missions in the near future.

2) Petition Office and Consular Service Opinion Boxes

One hundred and thirty-three Public Service Centers have been established to improve
consular services around the world. The offices comprise a Director, an Administrator
and a Consul. The Director is selected from high level officials and is accountable to the
Head of Mission. Additionally, from March 2005, opinion boxes have been set up in
which people can submit any complaints or recommendations for improvements. Various measures have been taken to increase the number of service-users and gather a wider
range of public opinion.

3) Consular Center at Incheon International Airport

In case one’s passport expires or is expected to expire within six months from the date of
departure, it is possible for an extension of six months or the issuance of a temporary
passport valid for a year at the Consular Center at Incheon International Airport.

###### 3. Information and Publications related to Consular and Civil Affairs

1) Website for Travel Safety Information


Since December 2004, MOFAT has been
operating a website providing travel safety information. It contains information
related to accidents abroad, travel safety,
consular assistance services as well as
safety tips, news, travel warnings, passport and consular confirmation by other
countries. Forty-eight countries are grad

#### Organizational and Human Resources Innovations for Enhanced Diplomacy

###### 1. Establishment of a New Enhanced Human Resources System

To keep apace with the rapid changes in the international environment, MOFAT became
the first government organization to abolish the rank system and has been implementing
the position classification system since 2001. The position classification system groups
posts according to grades and through a multifaceted performance evaluation process the
level of pay is determined by results.
Qualification assessment for applicants for the posts of Heads of
Missions has become more stringent. Such drastic measures have
contributed to greater efficiency and
competitiveness.
MOFAT has taken a step further
in accelerating human resources
innovation with the establishment of
the Innovation Committee for the

Presentation of Exemplary Cases of Innovation (Seoul, September 2,

betterment of the HR system, which 2005)

Chapter 2. Organizational and Human Resources Innovations for Enhanced Diplomacy | 217


-----

comprises academics and experts in the field of human resource development.
The Ministry has willingly accepted advice from the Innovation Committee to
complete an amendment to the Foreign Service Act, creating a group of new posts in the
field of consular services to enhance expertise and responsibility, applying stricter qualification assessment criteria for mid/high-level positions and relaxing the personal status
guaranteed by rank for diplomatic officials.
A group of new positions in the consular field has been created to meet the rapidly
increasing demands of the people and domestic enterprises going abroad. This will prove
to be a valuable step in contributing to the provision of an improved service in the future.
Such efforts by the Ministry have laid the foundation for the rationalization of its
remuneration policy based on performance and capability and the provision of higher
quality services to nationals.

###### 2. Constant Innovation in Human Resources

In addition to the newly adopted personnel management policy, the Ministry has
enriched its human resources, benefiting from personnel with diverse professional backgrounds in languages and trade. Visible improvements have been achieved in terms of
bringing diversity to the organization by accepting open applications and fostering
competition in the process of selecting Heads of Missions.
From July 1, 2005, in order to rationalize the incentive structure with regard to individual capabilities and performance, the Ministry adopted an incentive system based on
job performance for the positions of Director and above. In December, with amendments to the Civil Servant Appointment Decree, the groundwork for the Career Development Program was laid allowing for the building of career paths tailored to individuals’
aptitudes and capabilities.
Moreover, the Ministry worked out a program for posting civil servants from other
government branches to overseas missions. The initiative has nurtured an exemplary
human resources system whereby objective job specifications have been set to attract the
most qualified official regardless of his/her affiliations to other government organizations. One further positive result of this has been the lessening of rivalry among govern
218 | 2006 Diplomatic White Paper


-----

ment ministries.
The program is due to be brought fully into operation in the latter half of 2006 once
the legal and institutional groundwork has been laid for it to take concrete shape.

###### 3. Organizational Restructuring for the Enhancement of Diplomatic Capacities

The Ministry, in prior consultation with the Innovation Committee, undertook major
organizational restructuring, realizing advanced diplomacy, and promoting consular and
civil affairs services, better meeting national demands.

1) System of Two Vice-Ministers to Respond to the New Diplomatic Environment

With the end of the Cold War era and the advent of globalization, diplomatic relations
are becoming ever more complex in nature. With the rise in national strength activities at
the international level are thriving. In light of the changing landscape at the domestic and
international levels, the activities of the Ministry have also broadened in scope.
It was a long-standing practice in the Ministry that the highest offices were held by a
single Minister and a single Vice Minister. Against this backdrop, many underlined the
need to strengthen the representation of the Korea at the international level while

responding to the need for the balanced conduct of diplomatic activities by region and
issue. Accordingly, an amendment was made to the Government Organization Act on
July 22, resulting in the adoption of the system of two Vice Ministers.
This system provided ample scope for high-ranking officials to exercise diplomatic
activities to their full potential.
The two Vice Ministers have shared the workload, resulting in increased efficiency
and control, while ensuring greater external representation with respect to regional and
multilateral issues across the whole spectrum of diplomatic activities.

2) Reconfiguration of Staffing and Positions

Since 1998, with the total number of Korean travelers abroad having tripled, the number
of departures has exceeded 10 million for the first time, and annual cases of accidents
have also increased by fivefold. Yet despite the climbing figures, there has been a decrease
in the number of diplomatic staff, including consuls, compared to the early 1990s.
The Ministry has strived to expand the organization by securing more personnel in
response to the explosive public demand for consular-related services.
The existing consulates have broadened in scope to include duties related to Korean
expatriates. Moreover, a separate position of Ambassador for Korean Expatriates has
been created to offer immediate protection in cases of emergencies. It is envisaged that
such improvements will prove to
be constructive steps in terms of As of 2005

3) Reinforcing Diplomatic Capacity and Expanding Network of Overseas Missions for the
Protection of Nationals

The Ministry has endeavored to expand its network of overseas missions in light of the
newly arising demand for diplomatic activities in the areas of trade relations, the environment, resources, economy and trade. As one part of such endeavors, the Consulate
Agency in Mumbai was elevated to the status of Consulate General. Moreover, following
Korea-Russia Joint Declaration of September 2004, an additional Consulate General was
established and opened in Saint Petersburg, Russia, in March 2006.

###### 4. Constant Monitoring System for Transparent Diplomacy

Despite shortcomings in the inspection mechanisms, the Ministry undertook constant
inspection activities. However, two press releases on unlawful visa issuance and budget
irregularities tarnished the reputation of the Ministry, projecting a negative image in the
minds of the people.
To address the concerns, the Ministry exerted full efforts in initiatives for accounting

system that would facilitate constant
monitoring of the activities of all overseas missions.
In particular, securing the independence and credibility of internal inspection was set as key task in innovation.
