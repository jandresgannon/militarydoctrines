14,"# # # # 1. introduction the long term planning process outlines the continuous development of the norwegian armed forces with respect to organisation, infrastructure ( garrisons and bases ), personnel ( numbers, composition and qualifications ) and materiel ( existing equipment and new acquisitions ). this process is carried out under the direction of the royal norwegian ministry of defence. the long term plan – materiel forms the basis for all materiel procurements in the short term ( 4 - 5 years ), the medium term ( 510 years ) and the long term perspectives ( 10 - 20 years ). it is updated annually to reflect updates stemming from changing requirements, available",674,114,130,3,norway_2012_ArmedForcesFutureAcquisitions.md,2025-01-28 18:53:44
15,resources and progress in on going acquisitions. the government recognises the vital role that the defence industry plays in support of the armed forces ’ capabilities. this role ranges from the provision and maintenance of military equipment to the delivery of a wide range of support services. the government ’ s policies are laid down in a report to parliament ( st. mld. nr. 38 _ ( 2006 - 2007 ) forsvaret og industrien – strategiske partnere ) which outlines the _ guidelines for developing the strategic partnership between industry and the armed forces. the overarching principle is that the cooperation must accommodate the armed forces ’ requirements,659,108,130,3,norway_2012_ArmedForcesFutureAcquisitions.md,2025-01-28 18:53:44
16,". once this condition is met, the armed forces ’ materiel acquisitions and use of support services shall provide opportunities for norwegian industry to remain competitive in an imperfect market place ( where normal competition does not exist ). this will contribute to national value creation and highly skilled employment opportunities, while at the same time ensuring access to critical knowledge, expertise, materiel and services. interaction between the armed forces and industry will also strengthen research and development at government and private institutions. one of the main elements in the strategy is an early dialogue between the armed forces and industry, including communication of short term and long term materiel requirements. in the report to parliament",774,116,130,3,norway_2012_ArmedForcesFutureAcquisitions.md,2025-01-28 18:53:44
17,", it is clearly stated that the mod will work towards ensuring that the armed forces and the industry share information about industrial opportunities related to the armed forces ’ planned acquisitions at the earliest possible time. the cooperation shall be based on existing materiel plans. a central feature in the annual updating of the long term plan – materiel is the preparation and publication of an unclassified overview of long term materiel requirements. this publication does not examine each planned project in detail but is intended to create opportunities for in depth discussions between the armed forces and industry. in this way industry can get an early insight into potential materiel investments. the aim is",727,116,130,3,norway_2012_ArmedForcesFutureAcquisitions.md,2025-01-28 18:53:44
18,"to maintain highly skilled companies that individually or in cooperation with others, are able to support the needs of the armed forces. having a 3 - - - - - proven and highly skilled industry is also fundamental for being able to compete in the international defence market that in many ways remains a closed one. the armed forces ’ materiel investment projects are subject to decisions and approval either by the mod, or the parliament for projects exceeding nok 500 million. the projects listed in this publication are not formally approved for implementation. it is emphasised that any project not yet formally approved may subsequently be terminated or changed without any further explanation or liability. details relating",728,118,130,3,norway_2012_ArmedForcesFutureAcquisitions.md,2025-01-28 18:53:44
