21,"been observed. there have been major changes in the course of armed conflict : the dynamic stage of strictly combat operations has been shortened, while the post - conflict stage of stabilizing and reconstruction measures has been drawn out. 3. effectively counteracting modern - day threats and challenges requires a comprehensive approach to security on international and national levels. it calls for the ability to use diplomatic, economic and military instruments in synergy with a view to identifying, preventing and solving conflicts in their early stages. it also signifies a need for a wider approach to understanding security and for basing it not only on military capabilities and political efforts, but also to",722,113,130,6,poland_2009_DefenseStrategy.md,2025-01-28 18:54:28
