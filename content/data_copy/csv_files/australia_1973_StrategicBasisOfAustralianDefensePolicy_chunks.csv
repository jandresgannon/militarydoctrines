4,"# 118 report by defence committee naa : a5931, cl1030 canberra, 1 june 1973 secret strategic basis of australian defence policy – 1973 part 1 : introduction australia is remote from the principal centres of strategic interest of the major powers, namely western europe and east asia, and even those of secondary interest, the mediterranean, the middle east and the north west pacific. having ratified the nuclear nonproliferation treaty we are not a factor in the powers ' nuclear calculations and dealings. we are not a principal party in the shaping of any regional affairs relevant to their interests, nor are we under present threat from our immediate neighbours. 2",669,110,130,2,australia_1973_StrategicBasisOfAustralianDefensePolicy.md,2025-01-28 18:58:02

[ matter omitted ] b. south east asia ( i ) the forward strategy 15. for much of the last two decades, the australian outlook was dominated by anxiety about communist expansion into a weak and unstable asia and the possibility of ultimate pressure on australia. australia looked to a ' forward defence ' against china and north viet nam and the secure establishment of independent nation states in south east asia that might serve as a strategic shield. we therefore encouraged and supported substantial involvement by",729,120,130,2,australia_1973_StrategicBasisOfAustralianDefensePolicy.md,2025-01-28 18:58:02

14,"favourable, possible uncertainties particularly in the longer term need to be borne in mind. 17. a fundamental change in our position is that while australia may still look to its major allies, particularly the us, for strategic support in circumstances going beyond those they will expect us to handle ourselves, it must now assume the primary responsibility for its own defence against any neighbourhood or regional threats. this need for greater self - reliance and the ability to act 8 / 10 6 : 13 am 118 by | of and independently call for the maintenance at all times of defence strength which is adequate for immediate purposes and may be expanded if necessary.
